214,5,DOJ sues New York City over 'sanctuary' immigration policies,https://abcnews.go.com/US/doj-sues-new-york-city-sanctuary-immigration-policies/story?id=124048815,2025-07-24T20:33:31Z,ABC News,GB,immigration,"Mayor Eric Adams arrives to speak to the press on closing of asylum seeker arrival center at Roosevelt Hotel, on July 2, 2025, in New York.

Mayor Eric Adams arrives to speak to the press on closing of asylum seeker arrival center at Roosevelt Hotel, on July 2, 2025, in New York.

The Justice Department filed suit Thursday against New York City, Mayor Eric Adams and other city officials challenging the city's sanctuary laws for undocumented immigrants.

The suit was filed in the Eastern District of New York.

The department argued the city's sanctuary policies amount to an ""intentional effort"" to obstruct federal immigration enforcement and should be declared unlawful under the Constitution's Supremacy Clause.

“New York City has released thousands of criminals on the streets to commit violent crimes against law-abiding citizens due to sanctuary city policies,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement announcing the suit. “If New York City won’t stand up for the safety of its citizens, we will.”

In addition to the mayor, the suit names the speaker of the New York City Council and the heads of a host of city agencies, including the Department of Correction, the Department of Probation and the New York City Police Department.

The suit cites a number of provisions of New York City code and other policies, including a 2011 provision that bars the Department of Correction from honoring civil immigration detainers from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and rules governing the NYPD that limit police officers' ability to cooperate with federal immigration authorities.

The suit also points to the recent shooting of an off-duty U.S. Border Patrol agent in a New York City park during an attempted robbery by an undocumented migrant with a lengthy criminal record and outstanding arrest warrants.

A spokesperson for Mayor Adams told ABC New York station WABC that the city is reviewing the lawsuit and said the the mayor believes the city council should ""reexamine"" its policies.

""Keeping New Yorkers safe also means making sure they feel safe, and Mayor Adams has been clear: no one should be afraid to dial 911, send their kids to school, or go to the hospital, and no New Yorker should feel forced to hide in the shadows,"" the statement to WABC said. ""That's why the mayor supports the essence of the local laws put in place by the City Council - but he has also been clear they go too far when it comes to dealing with those violent criminals on our streets and has urged the Council to reexamine them to ensure we can effectively work with the federal government to make our city safer,"" the statement went on to say. ""So far, the Council has refused.""

DOJ has filed several other similar legal challenges in L.A., Colorado, Illinois, New Jersey, as well as one targeting the state of New York, challenging state policies that that blocked immigration officials from arresting people at or near courthouses without a warrant signed by a judge.

2,210,‘We are waking from a long sleep’: France’s ex-PM Gabriel Attal on revitalising relations with the UK,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/23/gabriel-attal-interview-uk-france-relations-macron,2025-06-23T10:41:39Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"In the conference room of a hotel in Kensington, the man who would be France’s next head of state is sharing his views about Brexit. Microphone in hand, Gabriel Attal is here to meet activists and expatriates. Once 270,000 strong, London’s French community has dwindled in recent years. The 36-year-old leader of Emmanuel Macron’s Renaissance party is doing his best to gee them up.

“We are waking at the moment from a long sleep when we talk about relations between France and the UK,” he says. In the face of war in Ukraine and turmoil in the US, old alliances are reforming. “Many thought the channel would become an ocean. And that all the ties that bound us had to be cut. But we are emerging from this sleep because in some measure we are forced to.”

In two years, when the term of his mentor, Macron, comes to an end, Attal is positioning himself to lead their centrist party into battle against Marine Le Pen’s populists. If he succeeds, he would take not only Macron’s crown but also his record as France’s youngest-ever president. For now, he is launching himself on the international stage, with visits to Ukraine, Israel and later this year to Africa.

In London last week, he was accompanied by his bodyguards and a team of smartly dressed young men, staffers and parliamentarians, graduates like him of France’s elite Sciences Po universities. During his visit he called on the former UK prime minister Tony Blair and laid a wreath at the statue of the French wartime leader Charles de Gaulle. On Wednesday evening in Kensington, in the heart of London’s French quarter, he addressed his audience with the confidence and lyrical flow that have earned him the nickname of “le snipeur des mots” – the word sniper.

“Liberty was given by the proponents of Brexit as a reason why they had to leave the EU. But being free is not being able to choose the colour of your passport. It is about being able to choose the face of your destiny.”

Attal’s rise through the ranks has been a succession of firsts. At 29, he became the country’s youngest postwar minister after being put in charge of education. At 34, in January 2024, he became prime minister, another record. He was cheered in the national assembly when he spoke of his pride at being the first out gay man to hold the office. It was a short-lived success – Attal’s term came to a premature end last September after Macron called a snap election in a bungled attempt to see off the hard right.

Dusted off and back in the saddle, he has not officially declared his candidacy for the presidential race in 2027, but he is fairly open about his intentions. Asked whether he would stand during an interview with the Guardian, Attal replied: “J’y travaille.” (I’m working on it).

The interview was supposed to be in person but London traffic intervened, and Attal, after a polite apology, spoke by phone from a car as he raced to catch the Eurostar train back home. His focus for now, he said, was on policy and party renewal. Renaissance has been churning out papers, with proposals to curb immigration and tackle teenage screen addiction. The party wants a social media ban for under-15s, and an internet curfew between 10pm and 8am for those under 18. Videos would switch to black and white after half an hour’s viewing. “I’m working with my party, Renaissance. I want us to have a project and a candidate. Many candidates for the presidency today don’t have a project.”

Gabriel Attal de Couriss followed a well-worn path through elite schools into the ranks of the political class. The son of Yves Attal, a lawyer and film producer, and Marie de Couriss, a film production worker from a family of traders who settled in Russia then Ukraine after the Bolshevik Revolution. He thrived despite the disruptions of divorce and his father’s early death from cancer. After attending the exclusive École alsacienne private school, he studied public affairs at Sciences Po, the Paris university whose graduates include Macron and a long list of presidents and prime ministers before him.

His social politics are a mix of liberal and authoritarian. He voted to make access to abortion a constitutional right, but has legislated to curb the wearing of clothes associated with Islam. As education minister he banned the abaya for girls and the qamis for boys in schools.

Last month, Attal proposed to go a step further, by outlawing headscarves in public for girls under 15. The reaction was swift and negative, with accusations he was just looking to grab headlines, and members of his own party distanced themselves. The Renaissance education minister expressed “the most serious doubts” about asking police to question or even caution children in the street.

Attal rejects the notion that designating the clothing worn by children as the latest culture-war battleground puts them at risk.

“I think that what puts a little girl in danger is to impose on her an outfit that consists in inculcating to her the idea that she is inferior to man and that it is impure for her to uncover her face.”

On immigration, he wants closer cooperation with the UK. He says Macron’s state visit to Britain next month, during which the president will stay at Windsor Castle, will be an opportunity for bilateral talks.

“I think there are several subjects which are absolutely major on which we must move forward,” he said. He listed defence – “the UK is part of the European continent and with France is one of the two countries that has a complete army” – the economy, energy and immigration.

On the vexed question of access for UK arms firms to a new €150bn (£129bn) EU armaments fund, he was diplomatic.

“When it comes to EU financial instruments, they come first to support the European defence industry, and it will depend on financial participation, but I know this is being negotiated right now. I hope we can find a way to deepen the military cooperation with the UK.”

He said the next big step would be discussion on how the UK can align with a new pact for asylum and immigration that will enter into force across the EU next summer.

The agreement allows faster processing and triage of migrants at designated entry hubs. Importantly, each member state will take an agreed share of new arrivals, or pay countries of reception €20,000 to keep them.

“It is very important that we can identify the way in which this pact will be implemented in connection with the UK,” said Attal. “I remind you that there is an estimate of 30% of immigrants who come to the European continent who do so to go to the UK.”

For Ukraine, Attal wants an accelerated path to membership of the EU. Hungary is threatening to use its veto, and farmers are worried about the continent’s largest food-producing nation flooding the tariff-free single market with cheap agricultural produce. The pushback has delayed the accession talks, which were due to begin this month.

In March, Attal hosted a summit in Paris with allies from the European parliament, and members of opposition parties in Hungary and Slovakia. They agreed to campaign for Ukrainian lawmakers to attend the parliament as observers, starting no later than 2026. Other measures included seizing the €200bn of Russian assets frozen in Europe to finance Ukrainian resistance and increasing defence budgets to 3% of domestic product.

“We have a situation that is obviously unprecedented, with a country attacked, at war, which wants to join the EU. And therefore the procedure itself must be adapted.”

Is he in favour of the parallel negotiation solution, which would allow progress without needing Hungary’s approval, being suggested by some officials in Brussels? It seems so. “I think all channels must be used,” Attal said.

He spoke with the confidence of a man adept at finding his way around obstacles. The interview came to an end as his car approached St Pancras station. A call to the French embassy, and Attal and his bodyguards were whisked through security, making the 11.30am back to Paris with minutes to spare.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

Jordan Howman, 34, landed at Dubai International Airport on Wednesday for a dream week-long holiday with his fiancée Theresa, 38, and daughter Kaic, 16, when immigration officers confiscated his passport

A British man has been left utterly gutted after being booted from Dubai on account of his facial tattpps.

Plasterer Jordan Howman touched down at Dubai International Airport last Wednesday, chuffed to bits about his dream holiday with his partner Theresa, 38, and his teenage daughter Kaic, 16. But joy turned to dismay when border officials called him over and nicked his passport.

‌



The 34 year old, from Crewe, had grafted hard, squirrelling away £3,000 for the holiday, keen as mustard to spend five days in what he dubbed ""favourite country in the world"" - the United Arab Emirates.

‌

However, Mr Howman reckons that a gruelling six-hour holdup at the airport ended with him being sent back home, thanks to his striking face tatts.

Jordan's adorned with geometric cubes and phrases such as 'blessed', 'family' and 'crazy life' on his visage about eight or nine years ago. He's quick to note that it's never been a bother on his prior pair of trips to Dubai.

He shared that his other half has been sobbing buckets, saying: ""It has absolutely devastated me. I feel like I've been massively discriminated against.""

Shaken by the ordeal, he continued: ""There's no law against face tattoos - there's nothing like that.

""I'm a lovely lad, I get on with anyone. It's made me feel absolutely rubbish. I'm not allowed in a country because of the way I look. It's properly, massively affected me.""

‌



The unfortunate incident has sourly turned his fondness for Dubai on its head. ""It was my favourite country, but this has absolutely ruined it. Now I'll never go again. I've lost all of my money because of a pattern on my face.""

The Emirates has become a top destination for affluent British expats and tourists, yet its strict social norms can sometimes catch visitors off guard.

‌



Mr Howman's journey on Emirates airline concluded at Dubai International Airport on Wednesday (11) morning at 7.30am.

""It was my third trip to Dubai,"" he recounted.

""I'd had no problems all the other times. But this time, as we got in, I scanned my passport and was just about to go through security when an airport worker pulled us aside.

‌



""We were about to put our hand luggage on the conveyor belt when the man said: 'Follow me'.""

An airport official then took Mr Howman to one side, enquiring if his passport had been stamped before taking it from him.

""Then he snatched my passport out of my hand,"" Mr Howman explained.

‌



""There had been nowhere to stamp it - we'd used the electronic gates. It was just an excuse to get the passport out of my hand.""

After a lengthy wait in a holding area for over four hours, Mr Howman was escorted to immigration around midnight, he claimed.

By that point, his family had already checked into their luxurious Anantara hotel.

‌



He phoned his partner, who rushed to the airport by taxi, but ""they wouldn't let me see her"" leading to her returning to the hotel, which cost them £250 in taxi fares.

Mr Howman described the ordeal of not having his passport returned for an extended period as ""terrifying"".

""A woman came and took me upstairs to immigration, where they said: 'He's not coming in because of his face tattoos - you're not coming in because of the way you look',"" he recounted.

‌



Revealing details about the incident, he shared, ""One of the staff behind the desk said a more senior immigration officer made the decision, saying I was not to enter Dubai and that I must leave the country immediately.""

By 2.30pm, Mr Howman found himself on another Emirates flight, this one destined for the UK.

Article continues below

Detailing the onward journey, he said, ""They sent me on a flight back to Manchester. It was only when I landed that I got my passport back. Friday morning was the first time I got to see my daughter, over Facetime.""

The General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai is yet to issue a statement regarding the incident, having been solicited for an input. Similarly, Dubai Airports has been reached out for their perspective.",GNews,,,not found,,,,"birmingham live, Birmingham Mail, birminghamlive.co.uk, Birminghamlive, birminghamlive",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/birmingham-mail/,https://ground.news/interest/birmingham-mail,not found,LEFT-CENTER (-4.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.4),United Kingdom,0,Newspaper,HighÂ Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,High,Center,Lean Left,Unknown,Unknown,Center,birminghammail.co.uk,,birmingham live,147,United Kingdom,Y,D,Birmigham Live,

The Trump administration is sending 200 Marines to Florida to aid federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers, according to a statement by U.S. Northern Command.

The deployment is part of a broader push by the administration to ramp up deportations using active-duty troops. Earlier this year, President Donald Trump deployed some 4,000 National Guard personnel and 700 Marines to California under a law known as Title X, which allows troops to be used to protect federal property and personnel.

Last month, the Pentagon announced that it planned to send another 700 troops to Florida, Louisiana and Texas to help immigration officials with logistical and administration support.

In a statement released Thursday, U.S. Northern Command said that among those 700 troops will be 200 Marines from the Marine Corps Air Station New River in North Carolina.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement will determine what the Marines will do and where they work, according to NORTHCOM.

There are already approximately 100 National Guard personnel assigned to the Florida immigration detention center that Trump is calling ""Alligator Alcatraz.""

An ICE agent monitors hundreds of asylum seekers being processed upon entering the Jacob K. Javits Federal Building on June 6, 2023 in New York City.

A lawsuit was filed against President Donald Trump's administration claiming masked agents have been targeting ""individuals with brown skin"" in Southern California, arresting them without probable cause and keeping them in ""dungeon-like"" conditions in efforts to deport them.

The claim, filed in the Central District of California on Wednesday, attempts to block the administration's ""ongoing pattern and practice of flouting the Constitution and federal law."" The lawsuit looks to stop ""indiscriminate immigration operations flooding street corners, bus stops, parking lots, agricultural sites, day laborer corners, and other places...""

""Since June 6th, marauding, masked goons have descended upon Los Angeles, terrorizing our brown communities and tearing up the Constitution in the process,"" Mohammad Tajsar, ACLU Southern California attorney who is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement.

""No matter their status or the color of their skin, everyone is guaranteed Constitutional rights to protect them from illegal stops. We will hold DHS accountable.""

Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News in a statement that allegations claiming law enforcement have targeted individuals because of their skin color are not true.

""Any claims that individuals have been 'targeted' by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE,"" McLaughlin said. ""These type of smears are designed to demonize and villainize our brave ICE law enforcement.""

A major complaint in the lawsuit alleges that detainees are being kept in substandard confinement facilities that are detrimental to their overall health.

""Members of the Southern California community have been whisked away and disappeared into a grossly overcrowded dungeon-like facility lacking food, medical care, basic hygiene, and beds,"" Mark Rosenbaum, a Public Counsel attorney who is representing the plaintiffs, said in a statement on Wednesday. ""The objective of this draconian crackdown is to eviscerate basic rights to due process and to shield from public view the horrifying ways ICE and Border Patrol agents treat citizens and residents who have been stigmatized by our government as violent criminals based on skin color alone.""

McLaughlin told ABC News on Wednesday that the Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention centers have higher standards than most United States prisons and those in detention are receiving adequate meals and health care.

""All detainees are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members,"" McLaughlin said in a statement on Wednesday.

""This includes medical, dental, and mental health intake screening within 12 hours of arriving at each detention facility, a full health assessment within 14 days of entering ICE custody or arrival at a facility, and access to medical appointments and 24-hour emergency care. This is the best healthcare that many aliens have received in their entire lives. Meals are certified by dieticians. Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.""

The Southern California raids have led to the detention of more than 1,500 people, according to the plaintiffs' attorneys. They claim that federal agents consistently refuse to identify themselves or what agency they are with when asked, using anonymity as a tactic to shield alleged lawlessness.

""In these interactions, agents typically have no prior information about the individual and no warrant of any kind,"" according to the lawsuit. ""If agents make an arrest, contrary to federal law, they do not make any determination of whether a person poses a risk of flight before a warrant can be obtained. Also contrary to federal law, the agents do not identify themselves or explain why the individual is being arrested.""",NewsAPI,-3.01,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/abc-news-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.71,"abc news, ABC News, abcnews.com, ABC, abcnews  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/,https://ground.news/interest/abc-news_409efb,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.1),USA,,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,The Walt Disney Company,1945,-1.42,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,abcnews.go.com,,abc news,22,USA,Y,G,ABC News,Y
6,210,Outrage as DHS moves to restrict lawmaker visits to detention centers,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/dhs-immigration-detention-center-visits-new-guidance,2025-06-19T17:45:40Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"The US Department of Homeland Security is now requiring lawmakers to provide 72 hours of notice before visiting detention centers, according to new guidance.

The guidance comes after a slew of tense visits from Democratic lawmakers to detention centers amid Donald Trump’s crackdowns in immigrant communities across the country. Many Democratic lawmakers in recent weeks have either been turned away, arrested or manhandled by law enforcement officers at the facilities, leading to public condemnation towards Immigration and Customs Enforcement’s (Ice) handling of such visits.

Lawmakers are allowed to access DHS facilities “used to detain or otherwise house aliens” for inspections and are not required “to provide prior notice of the intent to enter a facility”, according to the 2024 Federal Appropriations Act.

Previous language surrounding lawmaker visits to such facilities said that “Ice will comply with the law and accommodate members seeking to visit/tour an Ice detention facility for the purpose of conducting oversight,” CNN reported.

However, in the new guidance, the DHS updated the language to say that Ice “will make every effort to comply with the law” but “exigent circumstances (eg operational conditions, security posture, etc) may impact the time of entry into the facility”.

The new guidance also attempts to distinguish Ice field offices from Ice detention facilities, noting that since “Ice field offices are not detention facilities” they do not fall under the visitation requirements laid out in the Appropriations Act.

The Guardian has contacted Ice for comment.

In response to the updated guidance, Mississippi’s Democratic representative and the ranking member of the House committee on homeland security, Bennie Thompson, condemned what he called the attempt by the homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem, to “block oversight on Ice”.

“Kristi Noem’s new policy to block congressional oversight of Ice facilities is not only unprecedented, it is an affront to the constitution and federal law. Noem is now not only attempting to restrict when members can visit, but completely blocking access to Ice field offices – even if members schedule visits in advance,” Thompson said.

“This unlawful policy is a smokescreen to deny member visits to Ice offices across the country, which are holding migrants – and sometimes even US citizens – for days at a time. They are therefore detention facilities and are subject to oversight and inspection at any time. DHS pretending otherwise is simply their latest lie.”

Last month, the New Jersey representative LaMonica McIver was charged with assaulting federal agents during a visit to a detention facility in Newark alongside two Democratic members of the state’s congressional delegation. McIver called the charges against her “purely political … and are meant to criminalize and deter legislative oversight”.

New Jersey’s governor, Phil Murphy, also condemned the charges, saying it was “outrageous for a congresswoman to be criminally charged for exercising her lawful duty to visit a detention site in her own district”.

On the day of McIver’s visit, law enforcement also arrested the mayor of Newark, Ras Baraka, who they charged with trespassing as he attempted to join McIver’s delegation visit. The charges against Baraka were later dropped and Baraka has since filed a lawsuit against the state’s top federal prosecutor over his arrest.

Bonnie Watson Coleman, another New Jersey representative who was part of McIver’s visit, rejected the DHS’s claims that the lawmakers assaulted law enforcement officers.

“The idea that I could ‘body-slam’ anyone, let alone an Ice agent, is absurd,” the 80-year-old representative said on X last month, adding: “We have an obligation to perform oversight at facilities paid for with taxpayer dollars.”

Earlier this month, law enforcement officers forced the California senator Alex Padilla on to the ground as he attempted to ask a question to Noem during a press conference in Los Angeles.

Despite repeatedly identifying himself, Padilla was handcuffed and forced into the hallway before law enforcement officers shoved the two-term US senator chest-first on to the floor. Following the incident, which triggered widespread outrage across both Democratic and Republican lawmakers, Noem said she did not recognize the two-term senator and claimed that he did not request a meeting with her. The two then reportedly met for 15 minutes after the incident.

On Tuesday, the Illinois representatives Raja Krishnamoorthi and Jonathan Jackson were denied entry during their attempted visit to an Ice facility in Chicago.

That same day, the New York City comptroller and mayoral candidate, Brad Lander, was forcibly arrested by multiple federal agents and detained for hours as he tried to accompany a Spanish-speaking immigrant out of a courtroom. The DHS claimed Lander “was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer”, an accusation Lander denies.

Following his release, New York’s governor, Kathy Hochul, called his arrest “bullshit” and said that the charges against Lander had been dropped.

8,210,Karen Bass in hot seat as Trump targets Los Angeles – but it’s not her first crisis,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/karen-bass-mayor-los-angeles-ice-raids,2025-06-19T15:31:11Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"In the mid-1990s, Karen Bass was in the streets of Los Angeles, protesting alongside Latino activists against new laws that targeted undocumented immigrants and were expected to land more young men of color in prison.

These days, Bass is monitoring the status of protests against US immigration agents from a helicopter, as the Democratic mayor of Los Angeles.

Bass, a 71-year-old former community organizer, is leading the city’s response to an extraordinary confrontation staged by the federal government, as federal agents have raided workplaces and parking lots, arresting immigrant workers in ways family members have compared to “kidnappings”, and Donald Trump sent in the national guard and hundreds of US marines in response to local demonstrations.

As Trump and other Republicans have tried to paint Bass as the negligent guardian of a city full of wild criminal behavior, Bass has pushed back hard. The political career of Los Angeles’ first Black female mayor was forged during the chaos and violence of the 1992 LA uprising, which left more than 50 people dead, and in the long struggle afterwards to rebuild a more equal city.

When the Trump administration tried to depict a few protests in downtown Los Angeles as rioting equivalent to the aftermath of the Rodney King trial in 1992, Bass scoffed: “There is zero comparison,” noting that, as a Black community leader in South Central Los Angeles, “I was at the epicenter when it was occurring.”

Bass has earned widespread praise within California for her forceful denunciation of Trump’s immigration raids, and her focus on the safety of LA’s immigrant residents, and the terror the raids have caused. She has repeatedly described immigrants as central to the city’s identity.

“We are a city of immigrants, and we have always embraced that,” Bass said.

She has also made clear that what’s happening in Los Angeles has wider importance, and that the tactics the administration is testing out in one Democratic-majority city are likely to be used elsewhere. “I don’t think our city should be used as an experiment,” she said last week.

As city leadership, she’s been holding it down Eunisses Hernandez, LA city council

Bass, a force in California state politics before she spent a decade in Congress, built her reputation on consensus-building and pragmatism, not political grandstanding. Once a favorite of congressional Republicans for her willingness to work across the aisle, she is now denouncing Trump administration officials for the “outright lie” of their characterization of Los Angeles as a war zone, and saying bluntly that “this is chaos that was started in Washington DC.”

“As city leadership, she’s been holding it down,” said Eunisses Hernandez, a progressive Los Angeles city council member who represents a majority-Latino district north of downtown. “All of our leaders are navigating unprecedented waters.”

In the short time Bass has been mayor – she was inaugurated in December 2022 – she has been faced with a series of escalating post-Covid crises, starting with the city’s long-running struggle with homelessness and rising housing costs, then a historic double Hollywood strike in 2023, followed by ongoing economic problems in the city’s crucial film and TV business.

As multiple wildfires raged across the city this January, she was slammed for having left the city for Ghana during a time of high wildfire risk and dodging questions about her absence. Her leadership during the wildfires left her political future in question, with half the city’s voters viewing her unfavorably, according to a May poll.

The challenges Bass faces in leading Los Angeles through this new crisis are also only beginning, even as the first wave of Los Angeles’ anti-immigration raid protests have quieted in the wake of Saturday’s large nationwide demonstrations against the Trump administration.

“Our city is under siege,” said Roland Palencia, an organizational consultant and longtime local activist. “The plan here is basically, strangle the city: economically, politically, every which way.”

At least 2,000 members of the national guard and hundreds of US marines are still staged in downtown Los Angeles. A legal battle over whether Trump illegally deployed the national guard over the protests of California’s governor is still playing out: after a Tuesday hearing, a federal appeals court seemed likely to keep the national guard under Trump’s control as the litigation continues.

I do not believe that individuals that commit vandalism and violence in our city really are in support of immigrants Karen Bass

While denouncing the Trump administration for causing chaos in Los Angeles, Bass has also had to confront some of those taking to the streets, demanding that protests be “peaceful” and responding sharply to anti-Ice graffiti on downtown buildings and businesses, noting that the city was supposed to host the Fifa World Cup in 2026.

“I do not believe that individuals that commit vandalism and violence in our city really are in support of immigrants, they have another agenda,” she said on 10 June. “The violence and the damage is unacceptable, it is not going to be tolerated, and individuals will be arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.”

Meanwhile, federal agents are still conducting unpredictable immigration raids across the Los Angeles area, detaining people at work, in parking lots, and even at a weekend swap meet. Family members have been left without any information about their loved ones’ whereabouts for days: lawyers and elected officials have described horrific conditions in the facilities where suddenly detained immigrants are being held.

On Tuesday, Bass lifted the evening curfew that she had set for a swath of downtown Los Angeles a week before, one that major Los Angeles restaurants had complained had cost them tens of thousands of dollars. But the economic shock waves of the immigration raids are still rippling through the city, with many immigrants, even those with legal status to work in the US, afraid of going to work, or even leaving the house.

The message Angelenos have taken from the federal raids so far, Hernandez said, was “It doesn’t matter whether you’re documented or not: if you look brown, if you look Latino, if you look like an immigrant, we’re going to stop you.”

A third of Los Angeles county’s roughly 10 million residents were born outside the United States. Half are Latino. An estimated 1 million people here are undocumented.

Since the federal government stepped up the raids, swaths of the city once bustling with immigrant businesses and immigrant customers are unusually quiet, community members and local politicians say.

“It is pretty profound to walk up and down the streets and to see the empty streets, it reminded me of Covid,” Bass told the Los Angeles Times during a Father’s Day visit to Boyle Heights, a historic Latino neighborhood.

Bass has urged Angelenos to help local businesses harmed by the Trump administration’s targeting.

“Now is the time to support your local small business and show that LA stands strong and united,” she posted on X on Tuesday.

But Hernandez, the city council member, warned that the economic pain of the raids could escalate even further, particularly as immigrant families afraid to send breadwinners to work over the past two weeks faced the threat of being evicted from their homes.

“We cannot afford to have more people fall into the eviction to homelessness pipeline,” she said.

When small businesses lost money, Hernandez added, the city’s revenue was hurt, as well: “Our budget – a significant portion of it is made from locally generated tax dollars,” she said. “That revenue is drying up.”

And the city government, already struggling with a huge budget deficit after the wildfires this January, also faced new crisis-related costs, Hernandez said: “We’re spending millions upon millions in police overtime.” She noted that the police department had estimated Ice-raid-related overtime costs at $12m within the first two weeks.

Many journalists and activists have criticized the Los Angeles police department’s own response to the protests of the past two weeks as violent and heavy-handed. The city of Los Angeles is currently facing a lawsuit from press freedom organizations over the police department’s use of force against journalists.

Palencia, the longtime activist and organizational consultant, said Bass’s commitment to Los Angeles’ immigrant community, and to Latinos in particular, was not in doubt.

Bass’s connection to the Latino community is deep, Palencia said, forged both through her early political activism as the founder of the Community Coalition, a non-profit which built ties between Black and Latino communities in order to jointly confront the challenges of the crack epidemic in the 1990s, and through her own family. Bass’s ex-husband was Latino, and she remains very close to her four Mexican American stepchildren and their children.

But, Palencia argued, leaders like Bass and the California governor, Gavin Newsom, will need a long-term leadership plan, one that gives more guidance to all the state’s residents on how to respond to a new and dangerous situation.

Even though Los Angeles had had a quieter week, the feeling that the city was “under siege” continued, Palencia said.

“It’s kind of like a cat-and-mouse situation,” he said. “It’s very fluid – and it can blow up any time.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

A Florida Native American leader spoke out against a new migrant detention facility in the Florida Everglades, nicknamed ""Alligator Alcatraz,"" raising environmental and safety concerns for local tribal communities.

President Trump, visiting the site Tuesday, said the facility will hold ""some of the most menacing migrants, some of the most vicious people on the planet.""

The detention center, built on a remote airstrip in the Everglades, can hold up to 5,000 migrants in tents and trailers.

Talbert Cypress, chairman of the Miccosukee Business Council, said some tribal villages are located within 900 feet of the facility's entrance.

""This proposed facility is surrounded on all sides by the Big Cypress National Preserve, and the tribe has been at home in the Big Cypress for centuries,"" Cypress told ABC News.

Cypress pointed to the lack of environmental studies on what creating the detention center could mean for the local ecosystem.

""There's been no environmental impact study done. The environmental impact study that was done back in 1974 pretty much suggested that putting any kind of airship in the area was going to have significant impacts on the Everglades,"" he said.

The facility's closeness to traditional Native camps, where Miccosukee and Seminole members live and teach both American and Native education, has raised more concerns.

""We're concerned about safety... CBP, also just in general, all the traffic that's going to be coming through there, and flights coming in and out,"" Cypress said.

During the tour with Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Trump highlighted the facility's remote location.

""It's very appropriate, because I looked outside and it's not a place I want to go hiking anytime soon,"" Trump said. ""We're surrounded by miles of treacherous swamp land, and the only way out is really deportation.""

ABC News correspondent Victor Oquendo reported that the administration sees the surrounding wildlife, including alligators and pythons, as a natural barrier for the detention center, stopping migrants from being able to escape.

The facility might become a model for similar centers planned in Louisiana and Alabama, Trump told ABC News.

New data studied by ABC News shows a shift in enforcement priorities, with more arrests of migrants with no criminal record. DHS responded that 70% of ICE arrests were migrants with a criminal record.

The deal included the release of 10 Americans held in Venezuela, according to U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who said the result was that ""every wrongfully detained American in Venezuela is now free and back in our homeland."" In addition, the deal included the release of some ""Venezuelan political prisoners and detainees"" being held by the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, the U.S. said.

Regarding the return of Venezuelan migrants being held in the notorious CECOT prison in El Salvador, Bukele said in the post on X: ""Today, we have handed over all the Venezuelan nationals detained in our country, accused of being part of the criminal organization Tren de Aragua. As was offered to the Venezuelan regime back in April, we carried out this exchange in return for a considerable number of Venezuelan political prisoners, people that regime had kept in its prisons for years, as well as all the American citizens it was holding as hostages.""

Bukele's post on X included a video of what appears to be the deportees boarding a plane.

In a statement, Venezuela's government confirmed the release of 252 prisoners from CECOT.

The Venezuelans were sent to El Salvador after the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- to deport two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador by arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a ""hybrid criminal state"" that is invading the United States.

Many families and attorneys of the Venezuelans have denied they have gang ties and in April an official for Immigration and Customs Enforcement said in a sworn declaration submitted in federal court that many of the noncitizens who were deported did not have criminal records in the United States.

""While it is true that many of the [Tren de Aragua gang] members removed under the AEA do not have criminal records in the United States, that is because they have only been in the United States for a short period of time. The lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat,"" the official said in the filing in March.

The migrants were sent to CECOT as part of a $6 million deal the Trump administration made with Bukele to house migrant detainees as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Over the past several months, Trump and administration officials said they were unable to return any of the migrants sent to CECOT because the migrants were under El Salvador's authority.

But in court filings submitted last month, the government of El Salvador told a United Nations working group that the Venezuelans sent to CECOT were the responsibility of the United States.

In a statement to ABC News, Lee Gelernt, lead counsel in the CECOT litigation for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the administration appears to be ""trying to avoid all judicial accountability.""

""The administration sent these individuals to languish for months incommunicado in one of the most notorious prisons in the world without any due process and now appears to with this latest maneuver to be trying to avoid all judicial accountability,"" Gelernt said.

In a court filing late Friday night following the announcement of the swap, the Trump administration said it would now facilitate the return of former CECOT detainees to the U.S. from Venezuela, if required to do so by a court.

In a status report, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement official said the Maduro regime has made assurances it will not stand in the way if a former detainee is required to return to the U.S. The report was submitted hours after the prisoner swap was announced.

Americans included in the swap

Five U.S. citizens and five U.S. permanent residents who had been unlawfully detained in Venezuela were released in a prisoner exchange, according to the group Hostage Aid Worldwide.

They include Renzo Huamanchumo, Jorge Marcelo Vargas, Lucas Hunter, Wilbert Castaneda, Jonathan Pagan Gonzalez and Fabian Buglione Reyes, according to the group. They were detained between August 2024 and January 2025, it said.

""This is a moment of great relief and gratitude,"" Hostage Aid President Nizar Zakka said in a statement. ""Our hearts are filled with joy that these men will finally reunite with their families. We commend the Trump Administration for its diligent and continued efforts to bring Americans unlawfully detained abroad home.""

The Bring Our Families Home Campaign also confirmed that Hunter, Vargas and Castaneda are among the Americans included in the swap. In a post on X, the group thanked Trump and U.S. officials it says ""stayed true to [their] word"" in securing the Americans' release.

Castaneda is an active-duty U.S. Navy SEAL who was detained in September 2024 following personal travel to Venezuela. He was accused of leading a CIA-linked plot to overthrow Maduro, which the State Department has called ""categorically false.""

The State Department's Office of Special Presidential Envoy for Hostage Affairs shared a photo on X of the Americans on a plane headed back to the U.S. with American flags.

""Until today, more Americans were wrongfully held in Venezuela than any other country in the world,"" Rubio said in a statement. ""It is unacceptable that Venezuelan regime representatives arrested and jailed U.S. nationals under highly questionable circumstances and without proper due process.""

11,204,Lawsuit challenges a Long Island county’s partnership in New York with ICE,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-enforcement-new-york-nassau-37227af2b8caa186a7d30ba82430fcfe,2025-06-25T04:59:18Z,The Associated Press,US,immigration,"A suburban New York county’s agreement with federal authorities to empower local police officers to conduct immigration arrests is being challenged in court by civil rights advocates.

A lawsuit filed Tuesday argues the agreement between Nassau County and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced in February violates state law, undermines individuals’ rights and will lead to racial profiling.

Dozens of other police departments around the U.S. have similar partnerships, known as 287(g) agreements, with ICE, but only a handful exist in New York, where state law limits when police agencies can cooperate with federal immigration officials. The agreements ramp up the number of immigration enforcement staff available to ICE as it aims to meet President Donald Trump’s mass deportation goals.

Broome County and Niagara County officials also reached agreements with ICE this year, joining Rensselaer County, according to the New York Civil Liberties Union, which filed the lawsuit on behalf of the Diocese of Long Island, immigrant and refugee advocates and two Long Island residents. Nassau County is on Long Island just east of New York City.

“This unlawful agreement isn’t about safety, reason, or the rule of law — it’s about fear mongering and needlessly hurting immigrant communities.” Rubin Danberg-Biggs, Skadden fellow at the New York Civil Liberties Union, said in a news release.

In announcing the agreement, Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman, a Republican and Trump ally, said 10 county police detectives would be given the same authority as federal immigration agents and work with them to detain immigrants who are in the country illegally.

Blakeman said police would check the immigration status of people charged with crimes and notify ICE if they are there illegally. The arrangement also includes embedding officers with ICE and providing jail cells for short-term detainment until arrestees can be handed over to federal authorities.

“We are not aware of any lawsuit at this time,” Blakeman spokesman Chris Boyle said late Tuesday, “and while we typically do not comment on litigation, County Executive Blakeman is confident that all measures taken to protect communities in Nassau County are legal and properly authorized.”

An email seeking comment was sent to ICE.

About 22%, or more than 300,000, of Nassau County’s 1.4 million residents are immigrants, according to Melanie Creps, executive director of the Central American Refugee Center, one of the lawsuit’s plaintiffs.

“The 287(g) agreement between ICE and the Nassau County Police Department has created fear, eroded trust, and made immigrants, and all of our communities, less safe,” Creps said. “It undermines public safety by deterring immigrants from seeking help or reporting crimes.”",GNews,-2.46,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.81,"the associated press, Associated Press, AP, apnews.com, ap, ap news, associated press",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press-apnews/,https://ground.news/interest/ap,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/associated-press-media-bias,,,,,,,,Left,Cooperatively owned,1846,-3.02,,,Unknown,Unknown,Left,Left,Left,apnews.com,,the associated press,32,USA,,,,

(AP) — A coalition of immigrant rights, faith and pro-democracy organizations presented a letter with 12,000 signatures Tuesday to the National Sheriffs’ Association Conference in Florida, urging them to protect public safety rather than work with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

The letter urges sheriffs agencies to refrain from immigration-related issues, and stay away from what the organizers consider as the dangers of President Donald Trump’s “anti-immigrant rhetoric and harmful immigration agenda.”

About 30 people attended a rally outside Broward County Convention Center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, where the annual sheriffs’ association conference was taking place.

“When sheriffs take on the responsibility of federal immigration authorities, it undermines your core mission, stretches already limited resources, and most importantly, causes real harm,” the letter said.

Thomas Kennedy, a spokesman for the Florida Immigrant Coalition, said having law enforcement involved in immigration issues could lead to people being afraid to call for help.

“It’s a bad deal for our city in general, in terms of it being a welcoming place. It’s a bad deal for civil rights. It’s a bad deal for taxpayers. It’s a bad deal for public safety because these police officers are distracted from their tasks,” Kennedy said.

242,8,‘Cops in the form of alligators’: Trump visits Florida’s Alligator Alcatraz,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/1/cops-in-the-form-of-alligators-trump-visits-floridas-alligator-alcatraz,2025-07-01T18:32:21Z,Al Jazeera English,GB,migrant,"The migrant detention facility, located in the Florida wetlands, was built in eight days and will include 3,000 beds.

United States President Donald Trump has travelled to the southern tip of Florida to inaugurate a new immigration detention facility, nicknamed Alligator Alcatraz.

On Tuesday, Trump joined Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem at the remote facility, located in a vast wetland region known as the Everglades.

“This is what you need,” Trump said. “A lot of bodyguards and a lot of cops in the form of alligators.”

The president then quipped about the dangers: “I wouldn’t want to run through the Everglades for long.”

The facility, built on the site of the former Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, is designed to help address the need for more beds and more space to carry out Trump’s campaign for mass deportation.

State Attorney General James Uthmeier first announced Florida’s “Alligator Alcatraz” two weeks ago, sharing a video on social media that featured bellowing alligators and pulsing rock music to underscore the forbidding nature of the facility.

“This 30-square-mile [78sq-km] area is completely surrounded by the Everglades. It presents an efficient, low-cost opportunity to build a temporary detention facility because you don’t need to invest that much in the perimeter,” Uthmeier said.

“If people get out, there’s not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons. Nowhere to go. Nowhere to hide.”

Its nickname draws from the lore surrounding the Alcatraz federal prison, an isolated, maximum-security detention centre built on a rocky island in the middle of the San Francisco Bay in California. That facility, closed since 1963, gained a reputation for being unescapable — though there were, indeed, five escapees whose fates remain unknown.

“It might be as good as the real Alcatraz site,” Trump said of the Florida site on Tuesday. “That’s a spooky one too, isn’t it? That’s a tough site.”

Alcatraz has long been a source of fascination for Trump, who mused earlier this year about reopening the San Francisco facility, despite cost and feasibility concerns.

Similarly, the Alligator Alcatraz facility has spurred criticism for its human rights implications, its location in an environmentally sensitive landscape and its proximity to communities of Miccosukee and Seminole Indigenous peoples.

But the Trump administration has embraced its location as a selling point, as it seeks to take a hard-knuckled stance on immigration.

“There is only one road leading in, and the only way out is a one-way flight. It is isolated and surrounded by dangerous wildlife in unforgiving terrain,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Monday.

“ This is an efficient and low-cost way to help carry out the largest mass deportation campaign in American history.”

Dressed in a baseball cap that read, “Gulf of America: Yet another Trump development”, Trump flew to Ochopee to inspect the Alligator Alcatraz facility on its opening day.

Florida officials have celebrated the fact that it took only eight days to set up the detention centre, which appears to use temporary structures on the pavement of the former airport.

Governor DeSantis, who ran against Trump in 2024 for the Republican presidential nomination, said that Alligator Alcatraz would take advantage of the adjacent airstrip to facilitate expedited deportations for migrants.

“Say they already are been ordered to be deported,” DeSantis told reporters on Tuesday.

“You drive them 2,000 feet [667 metres] to the runway. And then they’re gone. It’s a one-stop shop, and this airport that’s been here for a long time is the perfectly secure location.”

The head of the Florida Division of Emergency Management, Kevin Guthrie, added that the facility will be equipped to hold up to 3,000 migrants — up from an initial estimate of 1,000 — with the potential for expanding the premises.

A further 2,000 people will be held at Camp Blanding, a National Guard base on the other side of the state, in northern Florida.

A poster on display at Trump’s news conference in Ochopee also advertised 1,000 staff members on site, more than 200 security cameras and 28,000 feet — or 8,500 metres — of barbed wire.

Guthrie sought to dispel concerns that the facility might be vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes. The Everglades, after all, collects overflow from nearby Lake Okeechobee and drains that water into the Florida Bay, making it a region prone to natural flooding.

“As with all state correctional facilities, we have a hurricane plan,” Guthrie said, pointing to the detention centre’s “fully aluminium-frame structure”.

He said it was capable of withstanding winds up to 110 miles per hour (177 kilometres per hour), equivalent to a Category 2 hurricane.

“All in all, sir,” Guthrie told Trump, “this has been a perfect state logistics exercise for this hurricane season.”

Still, human rights advocates and environmental groups gathered on the highway leading to Alligator Alcatraz on Tuesday to show their opposition to Trump and his deportation plans.

Protesters chanted through megaphones, “Hey hey, ho ho, Donald Trump has got to go.” Some picket signs read, “Communities not cages” and “We say no to Alligator Alcatraz!”

The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Florida released a statement prior to the facility’s opening, denouncing the Trump administration for conflating immigration with criminality.

The creation of Alligator Alcatraz, it said, was an extension of that mentality.

“The name ‘Alligator Alcatraz’ reflects an intent to treat people fleeing hardship and trying to build a better life for themselves and their families as dangerous criminals, which is both unnecessary and abusive,” the ACLU branch said.

Meanwhile, the Friends of the Everglades, an environmental group, called upon its supporters to contact Governor DeSantis to oppose the “massive detention center”. It noted that the construction of the airport itself had raised similar environmental concerns nearly 50 years earlier.

“Surrounded by Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve, this land is part of one of the most fragile ecosystems in the country,” the group said in a statement.

“The message is clear: No airports. No rock mines. No prisons. Only Everglades. Let’s not repeat the mistakes of the past. This land deserves lasting protection.”

Trump, however, argued in Tuesday’s news conference that the construction mostly built upon the existing airport.

“ I don’t think you’ve done anything to the Everglades,” he said, turning to Governor DeSantis. “I think you’re just enhancing it.”

DeSantis himself brushed aside the environmental criticisms as attempts to derail the president’s deportation initiative.

“ I don’t think those are valid and even good faith criticisms because it’s not going to impact the Everglades at all,” the governor said, promising no seepage into the surrounding ecosystem.

Trump hinted that the Alligator Alcatraz site could be the first of many similar, state-led immigration detention facilities.

“ I think we’d like to see them in many states — really, many states,” he said. “At some point, they might morph into a system where you’re gonna keep it for a long time.”",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,Y
14,213,ICE detainments at Bay Area jail spark alarm over strength of sanctuary policies,https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/06/24/ice-detainments-at-santa-clara-county-jail-spark-alarm-over-strength-of-sanctuary-policies/,2025-06-24T22:22:40Z,The Mercury News,US,immigration,"MILPITAS — Detentions made by ICE agents waiting for people being released from Santa Clara County’s jail system has raised alarm in recent weeks over the strength of sanctuary policies that have aimed to keep local law enforcement out of immigration enforcement.

County officials and immigrant-rights groups have confirmed that U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement agents have been using publicly available online portals — and leaning on jail staffers — to pinpoint release times of those they are seeking to deport.

The sheriff’s office, which operates the three county jails, confirmed to this news organization that last week three plainclothes ICE agents had asked for the release time of a man scheduled to leave the Elmwood medium-security men’s jail in Milpitas. It was not immediately clear why he was in custody at the jail.

The 35-year-old gardener’s wife, Maribel Mesa, said she had arrived early that day to take him home. Instead, she said, her husband was whisked from the jail lobby to a waiting vehicle and eventually was taken to federal custody in Bakersfield, where he remained this week.

“I saw these white trucks, and I never would have imagined they would have been ICE,” Mesa said in Spanish. “They detained him right then and there. I was crying. It’s so hard and I saw it all in front of me … I don’t know why they did it.”

She worries she might have to resort to selling his tools to help pay for an attorney.

In a series of statements posted to its website, the sheriff’s office said the detainments did not involve any violations of the county’s sanctuary policy.

“The sheriff’s office did not assist in the arrest, nor did we provide advance notification to ICE,” the statement reads. “We understand these events can cause distress. However, we are legally obligated to provide equal access to publicly available information — whether the request comes from a family, friends, or any law enforcement agency. We do not profile or selectively withhold this information.”

The office added that ICE agents “are legally allowed to be in public areas of our facilities” and office employees “cannot prevent or interfere with the actions of another law enforcement agency operating within the law.”

The sheriff’s office confirmed that four people have been detained by ICE agents at county jails in recent weeks.

Neither the Alameda County nor San Mateo County sheriff’s offices replied to inquiries about whether similar ICE activity was happening at their jails. The Marin County Sheriff’s Office said it was not aware of any such instances, as did the San Francisco Sheriff’s Office, which said deputies working the front counter at its jail do not have access to release times.

The Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Office reiterated its policy is not to hold inmates past their release dates, but that it complies with ICE notification requests for people “with specified felonious or violent criminal backgrounds.”

Raj Jayadev, co-founder of the South Bay civil-rights group Silicon Valley De-Bug, described the ICE activity as “incredibly alarming” and said Santa Clara County’s promise to protect immigrants from being vilified and mistreated is now being tested.

“Our community in Santa Clara County worked really hard to protect our immigrant communities in creating a policy to prevent people from being put into ICE detention through the county jails,” Jayadev said. “We had thought we had created a fortress for the most vulnerable. Now, to have ICE agents walk in, ask for the person they want, and for them to be hand-delivered to them, isn’t the vision of the policies we worked so hard to create and defend for years.”

“What this reveals is that the fight to protect our community against ICE in Santa Clara County is not a static one but dynamic,” he added. “If there’s a time when you need a county to hold a strong feet-on-the-ground policy, it’s now,” he said.

Federal immigration officials have complained for years that they needed local jails to honor civil detention requests to hold people identified for potential deportation after their release so that their agents could pick them up. When jurisdictions like Santa Clara County denied the requests, they insist federal authorities had ample access to information to perform that work without involving local law enforcement, who prioritize cooperation from immigrant communities to promote public safety.

County Executive James Williams reiterated that position in an interview, saying ICE could use publicly available information to aid with deportations, but that the county won’t use its own resources to assist. While long been considered a sanctuary jurisdiction by many, the term is misleading as the county doesn’t interfere with the work of the federal government, he said.

“That has ebbed and flowed across a number of administrations both Democratic and Republican,” he said. “ICE carries out its work in public locations using public data and public information and that is part of what ICE does.” .”

Since the first Trump administration, the county has been setting aside money each year for programs that support immigrants. After the November 2024 election, the Board of Supervisors ramped up their efforts, moving $5 million out of its reserves to the county executive’s office to help support immigrants through legal services, education on immigrant rights and other outreach efforts. In this year’s budget process, the board allocated $8 million more, which came as the county’s Rapid Response Network — a nonprofit-led community project that responds suspected ICE activity and provides training on due-process rights — experienced a surge of calls from residents fearful about immigration raids.

Members of the network and the Forum for Immigrant Rights & Empowerment Coalition, who met with Sheriff Robert Jonsen on Monday about the detentions, said the situation reflects a shortcoming in county policy that, to this point, had largely kept immigration authorities at bay.

One veteran community organizer with Pangea Legal Services said that the detainments, particularly with how and where they’re being carried out, nevertheless sow doubts among immigrant residents about the county’s promises to them.

“The arrests are now happening inside, not outside,” said the organizer, who declined to give his name as he feared being targeted by ICE. “Things are changing with the way this (Trump) administration is doing things, the way ICE is doing things. We need to adjust the policy to respond to that.”

16,195,What we know about reports of ICE officers at Dodger Stadium,https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/06/20/ice-agents-dodger-stadium/,2025-06-21T02:33:36Z,Snopes.com,US,immigration,"Alleged U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers appeared at the gates of Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles the morning of June 19, 2025. A small group of protesters arrived after the officers' location spread on social media.

After the officers left, the Dodgers posted to social media that "" ICE agents came to Dodger Stadium and requested permission to access the parking lots. They were denied entry to the grounds by the organization .""

"" ."" ICE soon replied and said agents were not present at Dodger Stadium. The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE, further said the officers were actually from U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

The Los Angeles Times later reported the Los Angeles Police Department "" said federal agents had gathered near the stadium to conduct a briefing but had left by the time images of the gathering began circulating on social media .""

"" ."" DHS repeated its social media statement to Snopes when reached for comment. The LAPD told Snopes it was present at the request of the Dodgers ""to address a growing crowd of protestors outside of the parking lot. … The LAPD's role was limited to facilitating the safe departure of the vehicles from the area."" The Los Angeles Dodgers, ICE and CBP have not responded to requests for comment.



On June 19, 2025, reports of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers at the gates of Dodger Stadium, home of Major League Baseball's Los Angeles Dodgers, surfaced online.

News of the apparent situation spread quickly on social media, with users on platforms such as TikTok (archived), X (archived), Instagram (archived) and Reddit sharing video footage and images of the alleged ICE agents at one of the stadium's main gates. Many posts claimed the agents were using the area as a staging location for upcoming operations.

According to news outlets on the scene at the time, the reports of alleged ICE activity at the stadium resulted in a small group of activists arriving there to protest.

During the incident, Los Angeles City Council member Eunisses Hernandez told local news station KABC:

""We've been in communication with the mayor's office, with the Dodgers, with Dodgers security, about seeing if they can get them moved off their private property. Public property is different. Private property … businesses and corporations have the power to say, 'Not on my property,' and so we're waiting to see that movement happen here.""

According to some accounts, the Los Angeles Police Department eventually escorted the alleged ICE agents away from the stadium at the request of the Dodgers. The LAPD confirmed this to Snopes via email but said the department was initially called to address the ""growing crowd of protestors.""

Their full statement read:

On 6/19/2025, around 10:28 a.m., in the 1000 block of Vin Scully Ave, LAPD Northeast officers were requested to the Dodgers Stadium parking lot, at the request of the Dodgers, to address a growing crowd of protestors outside of the parking lot. LAPD officers arrived and assisted with keeping the peace. The LAPD's role was limited to facilitating the safe departure of the vehicles from the area.

What happened after law enforcement left

After authorities left Dodger Stadium, the baseball team and multiple federal agencies made public comments about the situation.

At 12:12 p.m., the Dodgers posted on X (archived): ""This morning, ICE agents came to Dodger Stadium and requested permission to access the parking lots. They were denied entry to the grounds by the organization. Tonight's game will be played as scheduled.""

At 12:49 p.m. the Department of Homeland Security (archived) shared the Dodgers' post and added, ""CBP [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement.""

At 1:39 p.m. the ICE X account (archived) also shared the Dodgers' post, adding ""False. We were never there.""

The Los Angeles Times reported the LAPD ""said federal agents had gathered near the stadium to conduct a briefing but had left by the time images of the gathering began circulating on social media.""

Further, the newspaper reported some of the vehicles seen at Dodgers Stadium were also present in a raid at a Hollywood Home Depot identified by their license plates, but Snopes has not been able to independently verify this claim.

The raid in question was carried out earlier that day. CBP officers ""arrested 30 illegal aliens in Hollywood, California, and 9 illegal aliens in San Fernando and Pacoima,"" according to a statement from Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin, as reported by the Los Angeles Times.

According to an activist at Dodger Stadium interviewed by CNN, the alleged agents at the stadium had transported detainees there from the raid for processing. The witness told CNN, ""I asked what they were doing. He responded that they bring the detainees there to process them. … They conduct their investigation there without public interference … that they can't do it in the Home Depot parking lot because the public makes it too dangerous.'""

Confusion about which agency

The confusion about which agency the officers belonged to appears to stem from ICE officers wearing masks and no identifiable law enforcement uniform during their operations. As a result, it was difficult to assess which agency was actually responsible.

California state Sen. Scott Wiener even seemed to suggest the agents could have been neither ICE nor CBP, posting to X (archived), ""ICE says it wasn't them. DHS says it's Border Patrol. But honestly who the hell knows? They've given permission for any psycho to put on a ski mask, point a gun, grab people & throw them into an unmarked car.""

Community members and fans have been vocal about the Dodgers organization for not taking a stand on the immigration raids in the LA area in June 2025. The team previously said it would announce plans to help immigrant communities in Los Angeles, according to the Los Angeles Times.

The announcement was planned for June 19, 2025, but the Los Angeles Times reported Dodgers President Stan Kasten said, after the events of that morning, that it would be delayed.

When reached for comment, DHS repeated to Snopes the statement posted to X.

MAYWOOD, Calif. (KABC) -- A protest broke out in Maywood after a possible immigration raid on Friday afternoon.

AIR7 flew over the scene around 4 p.m. Video shows two major confrontations -- one in Maywood and one in the nearby City of Bell.

In Maywood, AIR7 was flying over the area when federal agents deployed some kind of tear gas or smoke bombs on a small crowd of protesters. The crowd quickly dissipated in the chaos, with a lot of people yelling.

Things became aggressive after the gas or smoke was deployed. One protester was seen kicking it back toward the federal agents.

Video shows multiple SUVs, seemingly belonging to federal agents, stopped on Slauson Avenue near Alamo Avenue, about a block away from where the gas or smoke was deployed.

Just moments before that, a protest on Atlantic Avenue in the City of Bell got heated.

AIR7 video shows a group of about 100 people who showed up after an immigration operation in the area.

The video shows people throwing rocks and bottles at vehicles as they passed by.

The photos show multiple busted windows on federal agents' vehicles.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shared photos of some of the damage their vehicles suffered during the operations. The photos show multiple busted windows.

Federal agents say protesters rammed their vehicles with other vehicles and also slashed tires on the agents' vehicles. At least one person was arrested for vehicular assault.

It's unclear exactly which agencies were involved in the immigration operations. Their vehicles were unmarked, and officers were not wearing recognizable uniforms.

247,8,Greece halts migrant asylum processing from North Africa,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/9/greece-to-halt-migrant-asylum-processing-from-north-africa,2025-07-09T14:58:19Z,Al Jazeera English,GB,migrant,"Greece has suspended the processing of asylum applications from people arriving by sea from North Africa for three months.

The Hellenic Parliament approved the temporary measure on Friday despite strong criticism from the United Nations refugee agency and Europe’s top human rights official.

The suspension passed by a 177-74 vote.

The ban was passed amid a surge in asylum seekers reaching the Greek island of Crete and after talks with Libya’s Benghazi-based government to stem the flow were cancelled acrimoniously this week.

It marks a further hardening of Greece’s stance towards migrants and refugees under Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis’s centre-right government, which has built a fence at its northern land borders and boosted sea patrols since it came to power in 2019.

Mitsotakis announced the suspension plans in parliament on Wednesday during an uptick of arrivals. An estimated 2,000 migrants and refugees had landed on Crete since the weekend, leading to anger among local authorities and tourism operators.

“Greece will suspend the examination of asylum applications, initially for three months, for those arriving in Greece from North Africa by sea,” Mitsotakis said.

“Migrants who enter the country illegally will be arrested and detained,” he added.

Mitsotakis said Greece’s navy and coastguard were willing to cooperate with Libyan authorities to keep refugee boats from leaving the country’s territorial waters or to turn them back before entering Greek waters.

Sea arrivals of people departing from northeastern Libya and trying to reach Europe via Greece’s southern islands of Crete and Gavdos have exceeded 7,300 so far this year, according to estimates by the Greek government and aid organisations.

In contrast, total arrivals in 2024 stood at about 5,000.

The sharp increase has strained both islands, which lack formal reception centres and have faced difficulties in securing temporary accommodation.

The migrants and asylum seekers mainly come from the Middle East and North Africa, including nationals from Sudan and Egypt, and also countries that include Bangladesh.

‘Illegal’

Greece’s move drew sharp criticism from human rights organisations.

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) expressed “deep concern”. While acknowledging Greece’s right to manage its borders, the UNHCR said border controls “must be in line with international and European law”.

Michael O’Flaherty, the Council of Europe’s commissioner for human rights, also condemned Athens’s response, arguing it “would legalise returning people to face a risk of torture and other serious violations, in breach of [Greece’s international] obligations”.

In a statement on social media on Wednesday, the Greek Council for Refugees demanded that there be no suspension of asylum, calling it “illegal” and a violation of international law.

The group accused the government of using the increased influx of migrants and refugees as an “excuse”, saying it “only demonstrates Greece’s inability to guarantee basic fundamental rights”.

Greece rescued about 520 people off Gavdos early on Wednesday and was taking them to the mainland, the Greek coastguard said.

722,11,A Better Suggestion For Illegal Alien Farm Workers,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/07/a_better_suggestion_for_illegal_alien_farm_workers.html,2025-07-05T04:00:00Z,Americanthinker.com,US,illegal alien,"Let me just state this right up front. Farmers in America, particularly ones that employ several to more than a hundred workers, are not unsophisticated country bumpkins. There will be no whining in this essay along the lines of “Oh, the poor farmer! He does not know how to fill out online federal forms for income tax withholding, immigration, etc.” That’s farm animal excrement! Farmers EFT their own quarterly income tax payments, so they can certainly make payments for their workers’ withholding.

President Trump has listened to the sad stories of loving employers and their willing wage workers providing our food in harmony for years together. In his desire not to disrupt agricultural commerce, he has listened to descriptions of fields full of rotting produce. But sad stories aside, it’s a bad idea to exempt a small segment of the economy from the rules, and it’s entirely unnecessary. Let’s look at some statistics to see if we can’t acquire a better-informed perspective than random anecdotes have provided.

Image by ChatGPT.

The latest Census of Agriculture reports that, in 2022, we had 1,900,487 farms in America on 880,100,848 acres producing $543 billion in market value of agricultural products sold. Eighty-five percent were owned by families or individuals, 7% by partnerships, and 7% by corporations. Of this number, only 1.5% of farms—28,464—hired migrant workers. Half of those employing migrants sold $1 million or more (market value) of agricultural products.

There were 3,693,391 farm workers, 41% of them unpaid (i.e., owners and their families). Of the paid farm workers, 32% were native-born Americans, 7% foreign-born US citizens, 19% authorized foreign-born workers (immigrants and temporary nonimmigrants), and 42% (917,487) were illegal aliens. Only 25% of all farm workers are illegal aliens.

What do we know about them? Almost all of them (86%) are from Mexico, so home is close by. California has more of them than any other state. Estimates are that California has between 375,000 and 500,000 undocumented agricultural workers. Florida has about 300,000. That’s almost all the undocumented right there in only two states.

To recap: Only 1.5% of all farms, half of whom sold $1 million or more in product, employ migrant workers.

Half of the migrant workers are illegal.

California and Florida together account for between 74% and 87% of all illegal agricultural workers.

Washington State’s cherry harvest lasts two months, pears a month, and apples about 10 weeks. In Florida, the sugar cane and orange harvests run about six months long. Planting and harvesting fresh produce is a year-round job in California.

The H2A temporary agricultural worker visa program has certain requirements that must be met. Employers petitioning for farm workers must provide transportation to and from the workers’ home countries. They must provide housing and either a food preparation area or access to prepared food. The employer must provide full-time work and wages in accordance with standard wages for American farm workers. The workplace must meet all federal and state safety, hygiene, and environmental mandates.

The employer, including any consortium of employers who together offer full-time employment, must file a petition with the Department of Labor to show the need for migrant labor. The employer must then file a petition with the US Citizenship and Immigration Services for the alien worker. There are companies that handle all of this for a fee.

The potential worker must be eligible for an H2A agricultural worker nonimmigrant (temporary) visa and must not be otherwise ineligible. The worker cannot work for employers other than the petitioner(s) without prior permission from USCIS, and is limited to no more than three years in the US before the worker must take a break of at least 60 days outside of the US.

If President Trump were to allow illegal farm workers to continue their work, that would promote continued criminality on the part of both the worker and the employer. It unbalances the marketplace when criminal activities result in profits greater than those who follow the law earn. Without enforcement, we dispense with the rule of law and subject ourselves to violations of the Equal Protection Clause.

Moreover, rewarding lawlessness erodes the nation’s conscience. Some of these workers were trafficked, some have criminal histories, and others are using false or stolen identities. Many are not receiving their rightful benefits or legal wages; some face unsafe and environmentally hazardous working conditions. For us to wink at this in the name of cheaper strawberries pollutes our own souls.

What should we do? Balance justice and mercy. Put the country on notice that the government will no longer tolerate exploiting migrant agricultural workers, just as the administration has declared that all illegals face deportation. Then provide a grace period so that employers can bring their working conditions, wages, and benefits into compliance with the law and send their workers home to get proper work visas. The grace period will allow the workers to obtain documentation (passports, etc.) under their valid identities. Mexican Consulates in the United States should be prepared to undertake this volume of work.

States that depend on migrant workers for their ag sector should jump in to assist with verifying the need for foreign workers. The Department of Labor, the US Citizenship and Immigration Service, and the Department of State need to streamline the petitioning and visa application processes. This would be the perfect task for D.O.G.E. to undertake.

A migrant worker who has lived here illegally will raise questions regarding the requirement that he has a home outside of America to which he intends to return after the job is finished. That, however, can be addressed through the interview process at a US consulate or embassy abroad.

This can all be accomplished with minor changes to existing procedures. No new laws have to be passed. That lets Congress off the hook on this issue.

And let it be known that after the grace period, those not in compliance will face ICE raids, OSHA inspections, EPA investigations, and IRS audits. We freed the slaves 162 years ago. It’s time to obliterate the last vestiges of those practices. And to those crying, “Who will pick my blueberries?” I say shame on you. Do better. Maybe even think about growing or picking your own.

726,11,Democrat Power Depends upon Open Borders,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/07/democrat_power_depends_upon_open_borders.html,2025-07-19T04:00:00Z,Americanthinker.com,US,illegal alien,"The Democrat party’s caterwauling over illegal alien roundups becomes only more shrill by the day. Last week, California politicians were very upset that federal agents had the temerity to disrupt the workings of a marijuana farm exploiting children for its labor.

It’s always a bit jarring to see what card-carrying members of the Democrats’ premier virtue-signaling club will find worthy of their righteous indignation. Many rational observers couldn’t have guessed that Democrats would pull out all the stops to shill for “child slavery.” Of course, there was also a time when rational observers could never have guessed that Democrats would embrace “drag shows” and “sex changes” for kindergarteners. Child slavery is kin to prepubescent body mutilation and minor grooming. Once children are seen as disposable “things” for adults to abuse, there are no limits to the kinds of degradation that can be excused.

Democrats’ ability to defend immoral behavior as the height of moral virtue is stunning. Many of the most vocal proponents of illegal alien labor in the U.S. are upper-class Americans who employ off-the-books foreigners as gardeners, maids, nannies, and other domestic servants. By hiring people who are here illegally, American bosses have much more coercive authority over their employees. Minimum wage laws, workplace safety regulations, payroll tax obligations, and insurance requirements can all be ignored. Illegal aliens are in no position to defend their rights as workers because those who employ them hold the threat of deportation over their heads.

While Beverly Hills AWFLs (affluent, white, female liberals) encourage violence against ICE agents, they complain that no one’s around to mow their lawns, watch their children, or deliver their groceries. When not too busy with yoga, taking selfies, chugging wine, complaining to the manager, or smoking (slightly more expensive) marijuana, they call President Trump “evil” for disrupting the tranquility of their plantation lifestyle and modern-day system of slavery.

To be sure, there are very real costs to an economic system that runs on illegal alien labor. The most serious costs, though, are passed directly to poor and middle-class Americans. Because it is cheaper to hire illegal aliens than American citizens, American workers miss out on jobs. At the same time, when millions of foreign nationals are pipelined into regions of the U.S., demand for local housing goes way up. What is the result? It becomes more expensive to buy a home, and average monthly rent rises. While wealthier families might send their children to private schools, poor and middle-class families that depend upon public schools see an influx of foreign children and increased class size. And while wealthier families might have Cadillac health insurance plans that provide for their families’ medical needs, poor and middle-class families that rely on basic care clinics and emergency room services find those places overcrowded with illegal alien families.

When municipal governments, such as Los Angeles, work with so-called “non-governmental organizations” and “charities” to transport foreign workers into the United States, they often provide illegal aliens with financial incentives. Many foreign nationals receive government assistance in the forms of “free” cell phones, public housing, food, clothing, and medical care. These are benefits not provided to American citizens.

By subsidizing foreign laborers, Democrat-run governments and taxpayer-funded “non-profits” disincentivize businesses from hiring poor Americans. Meanwhile, poor Americans are forced to share parks, hospitals, schools, and other public spaces with people who have illegally entered the United States. The financial upsides of an illegal alien workforce go to wealthy Americans, while the downsides fall on Americans struggling just to get by.

California governor Newsom, L.A. mayor Bass, and their taxpayer-supported army of Antifa street thugs pretend to fight avaricious billionaires on behalf of the underprivileged. In reality, they keep wealthy Americans flush with slave labor and kick poor Americans in the teeth.

It is appalling that Democrat elites work harder for foreigners than they do for Americans. When politicians advance the interests of Mexico, Venezuela, China, India, and elsewhere at the expense of American citizens, they prove that they have no business holding public office in the United States.

But don’t get me wrong. The illegal activity that Democrats aid and abet is big business. Not only does illegal alien slave labor drive up profits for corporations that depend upon Democrat party collusion to evade employment regulations, but also, this steady migration of foreign nationals benefits the financial bottom line of government bureaucrats.

There is an ever-growing number of city, state, and federal programs responsible for doling out public welfare in the United States. What does a growing government workforce specializing in welfare assistance require to justify continued taxpayer support? That’s right! Those government bureaucrats require a growing supply of welfare recipients demanding their services. If Americans ever reached a point when they were actually self-sufficient — egad, the horror! — the bloated bureaucracy of wealth redistributionists would be out of a job. For the government Leviathan to grow, a steady supply of indigent migrants must continue to flow into the United States. A permanent underclass is the only way to ensure a permanent bureaucratic overclass!

The ripple effects of open borders on government budgets occur everywhere. When California imports illegal aliens into its workforce, Democrat politicians benefit by gaining new congressional districts and Electoral College representation. State agencies and municipal departments also benefit by expanding their jurisdiction and obligations. Requests for federal funds rise as city populations rise. When a metropolitan police force is responsible for more residents, it requires more officers and resources. When a school district is responsible for more students, it requires more money and teachers. Population influx drives both taxpayer dollars and new government employees into an area, and, consequently, government executives become more powerful.

A principal reason why limited government is always preferable to entrenched bureaucracy is that the latter rewards failure.

President Trump is the first president to prioritize border security and the deportation of illegal aliens. To be sure, hundreds of billions of dollars have been allocated to these fundamental government responsibilities over the decades. Until now, however, all those funds have had virtually no effect. Why? Because successful government programs eliminate the need for their existence, whereas failing government programs constantly need more money.

If city, state, and federal governments use taxpayer funds to secure the U.S. border, unnecessary bureaucrats throughout the system stand to lose. Illegal immigration increases crime. Crime increases public calls for security and surveillance. The national security surveillance State, therefore, benefits greatly by keeping American citizens unsafe!

When government agencies only pretend to protect the border, lawmakers find it much easier to expand their power over ordinary Americans. If foreign drug cartels shoot up a neighborhood, then Democrats have a prefabricated excuse to call for gun control. If violent crime rates rise, then law enforcement agencies require bigger budgets. If illegal alien children can’t speak English, then new taxes must be imposed to provide for the educations of foreign students. The whole bureaucratic system depends upon a never-ending supply of failure!

It should be no surprise, then, that Democrat politicians will continue to cry fake tears every time President Trump’s immigration agents disrupt exploitative child labor operations in California’s marijuana fields. Just as it should be no surprise when wealthy AWFLs throw hissy fits because the president insists on deporting all their slaves. Their loss is Americans’ gain.

Corruption, after all, is the natural manure of Big Government. Decades of open borders have given us only more manure and bigger Big Government. Democrats have advanced their careers by burying the American people in foul-smelling mountains of dung. Cleaning up their mess is the first step to fresh air.

23,154,Study reveals double disadvantage for ethnic minority healthcare workers born overseas,https://www.news-medical.net/news/20250610/Study-reveals-double-disadvantage-for-ethnic-minority-healthcare-workers-born-overseas.aspx,2025-06-10T13:19:00Z,News-Medical.net,GB,migrant,"Ethnic minority healthcare workers who are also born overseas face a double disadvantage due to the combined effects of ethnicity and migrant status, according to new research published in JRSM Open.

Using data from the nationwide UK-REACH cohort study, this is the first analysis to explore how migration status - often overlooked in Human Resources records - intersects with ethnicity to affect NHS career progression.

The cross-sectional study of over 5,700 healthcare workers employed under the NHS Agenda for Change (AfC) pay scale - which covers staff including nurses, midwives, and allied health professionals - found that overseas-born staff were significantly less likely to be placed in higher AfC pay bands, even after adjusting for education, job role, and years of professional qualification. In particular, Asian and Black healthcare workers born overseas were less likely to reach higher pay bands compared to their White UK-born and trained counterparts.

Our findings highlight that migration status plays a critical role in shaping healthcare professionals' career prospects, yet this data is not routinely collected. These disparities cannot be addressed without first being recognised and recorded."" Dr. Ji Soo Choi, Lead Author

Although ethnic minority and migrant healthcare workers make up nearly a quarter of the NHS workforce, they remain underrepresented in senior positions within the AfC framework. Migrant workers may face additional challenges distinct from non-migrant ethnic colleagues, including difficulties with international qualification recognition, limited professional networks, and restricted access to training.

The absence of routinely collected migration status data means these issues are often overlooked in research, creating a gap that hinders efforts to address workforce inequality. The authors urge NHS policymakers to include migration status in routine data collection to enable more targeted and effective interventions.

""Ethnic minority healthcare workers represent over a third of staff at NHS pay band 5, but their presence drops sharply to just 10% in senior roles,"" said senior author Professor Manish Pareek. ""This lack of diversity in leadership limits influence over key workplace decisions such as pay, scheduling, and policy, which may contribute to a less supportive environment for ethnic minority staff. These inequalities risk driving higher attrition rates amid the NHS's ongoing staffing challenges.""

The authors recommend that NHS workforce policies explicitly address the distinct barriers faced by migrant healthcare workers, including training access, credential recognition, and mentoring and leadership opportunities.",GNews,,,not found,,,,"News Medical Life Sciences, News-Medical",,,not found,RIGHT-CENTER (3.9),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.4),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,,,Unknown,Lean Right,Unknown,Unknown,Lean Right,news-medical.net,news-medical.net,news-medical.net,179,United Kingdom,,,,
742,11,Are Democrats tacitly encouraging assassination hits on ICE agents?,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/08/are_democrats_tacitly_encouraging_assassination_hits_on_ice_agents.html,2025-08-01T04:00:00Z,Americanthinker.com,US,illegal alien,"On the July 23, 2025 edition of the Fox News show, Greg Gutfeld, in speaking of the CBP agent that was shot in the face by an illegal alien, Gutfeld said, “And you know Tyrus, when this story came out about this agent getting shot, the media wouldn’t say he [the shooter] is an illegal suspect. They wouldn’t say anything about him. Said an agent was shot on a rock in Central Park.”

In response, Tyrus said,

I have a problem with this, and maybe this is just… I don’t believe in coincidences, and there has been a concentrated effort to ‘out’ ICE agents. And for two men... grown a** men to get on a scooter to go riding in a park with guns, to go rob? That doesn’t make much sense to me. But two guys looking to make a ‘hit’ on somebody that makes sense to me. So, just how random is that? How many millions of people do we have in New York just walking around, and these two illegals just happen to stumble upon a guy, who just happens to be an off-duty officer? Bullsh**! It’s a ‘hit’ in my opinion and we are lucky he was able to get through it. And I would like to see the same vigor from our so-called government investigations that are dealing with this Epstein bullsh** and whatever Barack Obama did ten years ago. I don’t give a d*** about any of that. That is not a table issue for me and my family. Right now, my table issue is our police officers, and our border agents are under attack. We have senators or congressmen who are demanding they [officers] take their masks off so they can see their face, so they can expose their family. So, I don’t see we meant well at all. There’s that old saying, ‘The road to hell is paved with good intentions.’ Well, we need to start sending some of these people to hell.

Rep. Eric Swalwell, (D-CA), infamous for having an affair with a Chinese spy, accused ICE immigration enforcement officers of behaving like “bank robbers.” He stated, “I hope every state that is able to, and every community that is able to, unmasks ICE with their policies. If you’re standing on the law, you can show your face.”

Unfortunately, Swalwell had not considered that masks are needed for safety. Tom Homan defended the use of masks by agents stating, “The attacks on ICE is unprecedented, 700% increased. And we are not even talking about the doxing of agents, their spouses and their children.” Apparently, subversives are doxing ICE agents’ private information.

After a successful ICE raid in San Diego, CA, local city councilman, Sean Elo-Rivera posted on Instagram that ICE agents are “terrorists” and after criticism, stood by his comments. In response, acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Todd Lyons stated, “I’m sorry if people are offended by them wearing masks. I’m not going to let my officers and agents go out there and put their lives on the line, their family on the line because people don’t like what immigration enforcement is.” Then he asked, “Is that the issue here that we’re just upset about the masks? Or is anyone upset about the fact that ICE officers’ families were labeled terrorists?”

Illinois lawmakers are pushing to unmask ICE. California lawmakers are pushing to unmask ICE. Massachusetts lawmakers are pushing to unmask ICE. New York lawmakers are pushing to unmask ICE. Michigan lawmakers are calling for ICE agents wearing masks to be jailed. Democrats on Capitol Hill introduced legislation to require officers to identify themselves without masks.

House Speaker Mike Johnson stated that the Democrats who are pushing for ICE agents to unmask are the same “people who mandated mask wearing for years in America” during the COVID era.

Johnson stated that Democrats like House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries say that ICE agents should not be wearing masks as they arrest these illegal migrants. Johnson stated,

From the people who mandated mask wearing for years in America. It’s absurd. They need to back off ICE and respect our agents and stop protesting them. [The agents are] …trying to uphold the rule of law, and they don’t want to be targeted by Democrat activists.

In speaking of unmasking agents, Johnson continued and said, “Why? So that they can target them? So they can put their names and faces online and dox them? That’s what these activists do. So we have to protect those who protect our communities.”

In response to Democrat lawmakers on Capitol Hill trying to pass their unmasking legislation, President Trump stated,

Well, they would not be saying that if they didn’t hate our country. And obviously, they do. These officers are doing a tremendous job. They’re great patriots. If you expose them because of, you know, statements that have been made by Democrats and others on the left, usually mostly, I think, probably exclusively, you put them in great danger, tremendous danger. And it’s sort of funny when people picket in front of Columbia, in front of Harvard and they have masks on more than masks. I mean you can’t see anything. Nobody complains about that. But when a patriot who works for ICE or Border Patrol puts a mask on so that they won’t recognize him and his family, so they can lead a little bit of a normal life after having worked so hard and so dangerously, there’s a problem with that. This is the problem with Democrats, they have a lot of bad things going on in their heads. They’ve become very…they’ve lost their confidence, number one. And they’re really, they’ve become somewhat deranged. I want to do whatever necessary to protect our great law enforcement people. And they are right at the top of the list.

So, with Democrat lawmakers demanding the unmasking of ICE and Border Patrol agents, are they tacitly encouraging criminal activity against our government’s law enforcement agents and their families?

25,210,Less than 4% of exploited care workers helped by UK government scheme,https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/jun/06/less-than-4-of-exploited-care-workers-helped-by-uk-government-scheme,2025-06-05T23:01:18Z,The Guardian,GB,migrant,"Less than 4% of exploited care workers have reported finding new work in a multimillion-pound government scheme designed to rematch them with new employers.

Analysis by the Work Rights Centre found just 3.4% of the 28,000 exploited migrant care workers signposted to a service to find them new jobs had reported being rematched with a new employer, while 131,000 social care vacancies remain unfilled.

Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol, chief executive of the charity, said: “After Covid, England desperately needed more care workers, and thousands of people from around the world answered that call in good faith.

“But instead of jobs they got scams, and instead of justice they got a referral to a programme that simply doesn’t work as intended.”

Thousands of carers who came to the UK on employer-tied visas were referred to government job-finding services between May 2024 and April 2025 after being found victim of exploitative practices.

At least 470 care providers have had their licence to sponsor migrant care workers removed since 2022, after it was found many charged workers thousands in sponsorship fees for jobs that never materialised, or offered work below minimum wage levels, in breach of UK employment and modern slavery laws.

New data revealed through freedom of information requests showed that as of 30 April, 941 migrant workers had reported finding alternative employment with bona fide visa sponsors through the government scheme.

The government said the self-reported data does “not provide a complete picture” as “workers were initially under no obligation to report their employment outcomes”.

Last month the government announced plans to ban new recruitment from abroad for care roles and encouraged employers to recruit people from the existing pool of displaced care workers.

Adis Sehic, policy manager at the Work Rights Centre, said: “Part of the government’s rationale in ending international recruitment in social care was that thousands of displaced and exploited workers already in England would be given the opportunity to do the jobs they were initially promised.”

He said the data suggested that the programme has not been effective and raises “serious questions marks over the viability of the government’s plans to end international recruitment in social care”.

“As bona fide care providers face higher payroll costs, many shy away from taking on new recruits from the cohort of displaced workers,” he said. “Workers are therefore still in limbo, labour shortages in care continue, and the pressure of caring for England’s frail and elderly is only likely to mount further.”

The charity is calling for more flexibility for migrant workers to take up jobs in the sector without the costs of Home Office-approved sponsorship, as well as tougher penalties for non-compliant employers, including fines and charges.

A government spokesperson said: “Over 900 workers have been directly matched into new employment thanks to the international recruitment fund and thousands more are being supported through our regional partnerships with CV writing, interview techniques and signposting.

“Since April, employers wanting to recruit migrant care workers need to first consider recruiting from the pool of displaced workers – getting them back to work, into fulfilling careers and boosting productivity.

“To reduce reliance on international care workers in adult social care, and fully crackdown on abuse and exploitation of migrant workers, we have announced that we are putting an end to the overseas care visa.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
747,11,Legalization And/Or Amnesty: Can It Ever Be Done Right?,https://www.americanthinker.com/articles/2025/07/legalization_and_or_amnesty_can_it_ever_be_done_right.html,2025-07-13T04:00:00Z,Americanthinker.com,US,illegal alien,"As of December 2024, there were approximately 40 million illegal aliens (or people who should be classified as illegal aliens) living in the United States. Before Biden entered office, there were roughly 20 million illegal aliens in America. Two-thirds of that number were people who had overstayed lawful admissions

Under Biden another approximately 20 million entered, some of whom were apprehended at the border and released into the country, some were allowed to apply fraudulently for asylum and be admitted, some crossed illegally without interception, some were admitted under the bogus CBP-1 humanitarian parole program, and some came flooding in from Temporary Protected Status countries for whom Biden extended the program.

Image created using ChatGPT.

All of them should leave the US, either on their own or by deportation. With perhaps a few exceptions (maybe CPB-1), they are all criminals. Every day, we hear stories of violent illegal alien felons and their pitiful victims.

We need to understand that unauthorized entry or overstay is a crime. Working without authorization, without paying mandatory payroll deductions (federal and state), and using a SSN or name not their own are all crimes. Accessing federal and state benefits under a false identity is criminal. Using another’s identity to access medical care, obtain bank loans, go to university, or buy a car is criminal fraud.

It is a corruption, and it is corrupting the soul of the nation. We are not a people who should wink at the commercial advantages gained by those who break immigration law by hiring illegals and not giving them the pay and benefits to which workers are entitled. Illegal aliens force everyone to pay more for housing—whether rental or by purchase—because illegal-driven demand exceeds supply.

Their presence forces longer waits for both routine and emergency medical care because hundreds of thousands fill the waiting rooms here rather than in their own countries. Americans are facing rising taxes to fund education from a shrinking base because of the number of children of illegal aliens filling up the classrooms. We all might not have been carjacked by an illegal, but their presence here is costing everyone far too much.

Despite this tremendous burden on Americans, even some conservatives are calling for a sort of softened legalization, motivated by misplaced sympathy for those illegally in this country, rather than for Americans or those who are following the rules to be here. History says that this is a foolish effort.

Let’s look at our big previous legalization program. The late David North of the Center for Immigration Studies wrote an excellent analysis of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1982 (IRCA). Among his conclusions were (1) much larger numbers than had been anticipated applied; (2) there was a great deal of fraud in the program; and (3) the fraud rarely resulted in a denial.

Enacting a legalization/amnesty program invites millions to “try their luck.” I can’t tell you how often I heard that from unsuccessful or ineligible visa applicants. They will swarm into the country by any possible means and route. Putting a limiting date on presence in the United States to determine program eligibility will only fuel innumerable fraudulent document mills, unscrupulous public notaries, and unethical immigration lawyers.

And who would these folks be? Current estimates are that 44% of illegals are Mexican, 3% are Filipino, 2% are Indian, 2% are Chinese, 25% are from other Central and South American countries, and 24% from the rest of the world.

Meanwhile, 4 million potential immigrants, just 10% of the number who should not be here, are currently waiting (some more than 20 years) for their legal immigration interview (due to congressionally-mandated numerical limitations). Of them, 30% are Mexican, 7% Indian, 7% Filipino, and 6% Chinese. See where this is going? We have millions waiting to join us the legal way, yet we’re considering letting criminal millions jump the line ahead of them.

I’d like to see all the illegals removed and if we decide as a policy that we need more immigrants, we should process as quickly as possible those already waiting in the legal way. We can establish a cutoff of those already processed by USCIS and pending in the system.

Gad Saad’s next book, Suicidal Empathy, cannot be released soon enough. The title says it all. I’m afraid we’re headed down this path with a soft amnesty for the “good guy” illegals in the country. So, here’s a hybrid and much better proposal:

Should we choose to initiate a program to legalize aliens who are unlawfully present in the United States, it should be limited to those who entered the United States lawfully and overstayed their legal admission. We already have their data in our system (e.g., their names, dates and places of birth, passport numbers, dates admitted, and durations of stays authorized).

With these “overstays,” we don’t have to worry about fraudulent identities. They had a security check in our systems before receiving their visa or admission from a visa waiver country. They had a reason to be here. Many of them already had friends and relatives here who, if needed, can help them overcome the public charge ineligibility. Any who have committed crimes or obtained federal benefits via fraud can be excluded. Give the program a cut-off date that accepts only those here before November 3, 2020, to weed out those whose visas came when the Biden Administration took over.

We do not have to give them a path to citizenship. They can be granted conditional legal residency for life, as long as they avoid criminal behavior. This will take an act of Congress, something they need to get started on immediately. It can be a limited immigration bill, speeding up processing for those waiting, and permitting lifelong conditional residency for visa overstays not otherwise ineligible.

As it seems we may well go down this amnesty/legalization path, this proposal will make it as easy as possible for ourselves. We will not be rewarding those who entered illegally, with each one of them knowing they were committing a crime as they did so. We will also not be rewarding traffickers and trafficking.

This plan will partially satisfy the immigration hawks as well as the doves. A quasi-quasi for both sides of the debate.

BBC Breakfast viewers expressed their dismay as the programme reported on the surge in migrant crossings over the weekend.

The number of migrants arriving in the UK after crossing the English Channel hit a new single-day high for 2025 on Saturday, with more than 1,100 people making the journey.

Speaking from Dover, reporter Simon Jones commented: ""I think it was largely down to the weather, because we saw a week when it was really windy, so no crossings at all, and that's when people are gathering over in Calais waiting for the weather to change. On Saturday, it was really calm out there in the channel, that's why we saw so many people make a crossing.

In total, almost 1200 people arrived in 18 different boats. It takes the total so far this year to around 14,800 people, and given that crossings tend to increase in the summer months, we are well on course to beat the numbers from last year, when 37,000 people arrived in small boats.""

He went on to say: ""On Saturday, boat after boat launched from northern France, we saw what are known as taxi boats, so the boats are already in the water.

BBC Breakfast reporter discusses latest migrant crossings

BBC Breakfast viewers expressed their discontent as the programme delivered the latest update on migrant crossings over the weekend.

A record-breaking number of more than 1,100 migrants reached the UK on Saturday after traversing the English Channel, marking the highest figure for a single day in 2025.

‌



Reporting from Dover, Simon Jones commented: ""I think it was largely down to the weather, because we saw a week when it was really windy, so no crossings at all, and that's when people are gathering over in Calais waiting for the weather to change.

‌



""On Saturday, it was really calm out there in the channel, that's why we saw so many people make a crossing.""

BBC Breakfast's Simon Jones issued a huge migrant update (Image: BBC )

He further detailed: ""In total, almost 1200 people arrived in 18 different boats. It takes the total so far this year to around 14,800 people, and given that crossings tend to increase in the summer months, we are well on course to beat the numbers from last year, when 37,000 people arrived in small boats.

""On Saturday, boat after boat launched from northern France, we saw what are known as taxi boats, so the boats are already in the water. People then wade into the water to climb aboard, and smugglers use this tactic because French police won't intervene if the boat is already in the water.

""On Saturday, we witnessed police officers on the beach seemingly standing by and doing nothing. The French government claims it will change the rules to allow police to intervene in shallow waters, but this has yet to be implemented.""

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp has suggested that a recent EU deal, permitting EU vessels to fish in UK waters for 12 more years, should be suspended until the French begin stopping boats at sea, reports the Express.

When immigration agents came to the farm where he worked, Jaime Alanis tried to hide. Climbing to the roof of a greenhouse, while agents rounded up and arrested dozens of his coworkers below, Mr Alanis hoped to stay out of sight. Then he fell. His neck was broken and skull fractured. He died later in hospital. Meanwhile, immigration agents fired teargas at a crowd of some 500 protestors, who had gathered to stop the raids outside two legal cannabis farms. Some threw rocks, and the FBI says one fired a gun at federal agents. Mr Alanis's death, and the violent clashes that ensued at those cannabis farms, are the latest examples of the kind of chaos that has swept across southern California since the beginning of June, when immigration raids began to intensify in the region. Those crackdowns sparked protests, which led to US President Donald Trump deploying the National Guard and US Marines, to protect federal officers from the demonstrators and to ensure that his mass deportations, which he had long promised, were carried out.

Watch: Protesters clash with immigration agents after farm raid in California

While many Americans support Trump's tough immigration policies, the relentlessness of the raids in the region has also triggered a fierce backlash from neighbours and activists. Southern California is home to an estimated 1.4 million undocumented immigrants, many of whom have been forced into hiding - too afraid to go to work, school or even the grocery store. In so doing, the raids have altered the landscape of one of the country's most populous regions. Businesses are shuttered, cities have cancelled community events - including Fourth of July fireworks celebrations. ""Everyone's looking over their shoulders,"" says a ""raspado"" vendor in Los Angeles on a recent Sunday, where normally crowded soccer fields and picnic tables were mostly deserted. As she prepared the shaved ice with sweet strawberry syrup, she seemed wary of questions but grateful for a customer. ""It's never like this,"" she said.

The raids at the two cannabis farms are now being touted as the largest immigration operation since Trump took office. Of the 361 migrants detained during those raids, four had ""extensive"" criminal records, including rape, kidnapping, and attempted child molestation, media reported. Immigration officers also found 14 migrant children, who the administration claims have been ""rescued from potential exploitation, forced labor, and human trafficking"". While the administration frequently highlights the convicted rapists, murderers and drug dealers they have arrested in operations, scores of immigrants - many with no criminal convictions who have spent decades building businesses, families and homes - have been caught in the crosshairs. ""They just kidnap you,"" says Carlos, who didn't want his full last name used out of fear that he could be deported to his native Guatemala. He has been too afraid to go to work since his sister, Emma, was detained while selling tacos outside a Home Depot last month. ""If I'm brown, if I'm Hispanic, they just come and catch you and take you."" The Trump administration says claims that people are being targeted because of their skin colour are ""disgusting"" and false. Carlos says he feels a bit safer since a federal judge in California ordered the Trump administration to stop ""indiscriminately"" detaining people with ""roving patrols"" of federal agents. But he doesn't trust that they will stop, and he needs to go back to work. ""How am I going to pay my rent,"" he says. ""I'm stuck inside.""

Getty Images Word spread quickly of a federal immigration operation in LA's MacArthur Park

Churches and immigrant rights groups have been organising food delivery for people in hiding. They have also been training people to protect immigrants out on the streets using apps, text chains and social media to alert people when federal agents are nearby. When dozens of armed agents in camouflage descended on MacArthur Park on horseback and in armoured vehicles earlier this month, few were surprised. Word had spread quickly of the operation – and rumours had swirled that ""la migra"" was coming hours before the troops arrived. Dozens of protesters swarmed to greet the troops – including LA Mayor Karen Bass, who demanded they leave the park. Witnesses say no arrests were made and no one was seen running to escape. By the time troops arrived – with professional-looking camera crews recording the overt show of force – the only people in the park were protesters, some kids at a summer camp, and some homeless people asleep in the grass. ""It's been gut wrenching,"" says Betsy Bolte, who lives near the park and had showed up to protest and yell obscenities at the agents. ""It's war against the people – the heart and soul of the economy. And it's all intentional. It's part of the plan,"" she said, crying while showing reporters her footage. Activists accuse the government of terrorising its own people. ""This is part of a programme of terror. From Los Angeles to the Central Coast, the Trump administration is weaponising the federal government and military against Californians,"" says the advocacy group CAUSE. But not all Californians agree. Trump won 38% of the ballots in November. Recently, the BBC featured the story of one woman who is still devoted to the president and his mass deportation plans, even while she's locked up as an illegal immigrant. And a lone Trump supporter showed up at the protest at the cannabis farm last week, only to be beaten and jeered at and spat on by protesters. Perhaps ironically, the architect of many of Trump's deportation policies, is an Angeleno himself. Senior White House aide Stephen Miller was raised in liberal Santa Monica where even as a teenager he was known on conservative radio for condemning the use of Spanish in his school. He told Fox News this week that California's ""violent"" Democratic politicians who show up to protest were inciting violence against federal immigration agents. ""No city can aid and abet an invasion of this country over the will of the American people and the law enforcement officers empowered to enact the American people's wills,"" he said. Trump's ""border tsar"" Tom Homan says Los Angeles has itself to blame because LA's sanctuary laws prevent local law enforcement from co-operating with immigration agents inside jails, where they could detain immigrant offenders outside of the public eye. ""We're going to double down, triple down on sanctuary cities,"" Homan told reporters, adding that they do not have such overt public raids in Florida because all the sheriffs there let immigration agents into the jails to detain immigrants. ""If they don't let us arrest the bad guy in the county jail, they're going to arrest them in the community. We're going to arrest them at a work site.""

Senior government figures believe they are on the cusp of achieving a breakthrough with Emmanuel Macron on a deal that would see France take back at least some of those who have crossed the English Channel on small boats.

In return, the UK would take asylum claimants from France who wish to come to the UK and are believed to have a legitimate reason to do so.

It's being called a ""one-in-one"" out deal, although the numbers will be greater than that.

But the key word to watch out for, when the deal is announced later, is ""deterrent"".

Sir Keir Starmer has said both he and the French president agree on the need for ""a new deterrent to break the business model of the gangs"".

The big question is the extent to which what is agreed to amounts to that, particularly in the short term.

Will it put people off getting in a small boat?

The pilot scheme is expected to involve around 50 migrants a week being returned to France, in return for the UK taking the same number of asylum seekers in France who are deemed to have a legitimate case to move to the UK.

Critics, including the Conservatives, say this would amount to about 5% of those who are attempting crossing currently, and so would be an inadequate deterrent.

The Tories point to the deterrent they planned but never got started - the idea of sending migrants to Rwanda. This scheme was scrapped when Labour won the election.

But it is true to say this agreement, albeit limited in scale initially, marks a new moment in Franco British diplomacy on this issue - the willingness of France to take back some of those who embark on the cross Channel journey.

The test, in the months and years ahead, can it be scaled up sufficiently to make a noticeable impact on the numbers?

Or, to put it more bluntly, do the numbers attempting a crossing start to fall, or not?

Because unless they do, the scheme, on this side of the Channel at least, is likely to be seen as a failure.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,Y

Watch: BBC on French beach as police slash migrant 'taxi-boat' heading to UK

French police have waded into shallow waters off a beach south of Boulogne and used knives to slash an inflatable small boat - packed with men, women and children - that was wallowing, dangerously, in the waves.

All those onboard clambered to safety as the boat collapsed in chaotic scenes.

The intervention was highly unusual.

French police usually follow strict rules that bar them from going into the sea in case they put lives at risk.

""Let's go in,"" said one of the gendarmes, pulling off his body armour, and taking out a small knife. His colleagues took their heavy armour off, too, placing equipment in the back of a nearby police car before rushing into the water.

There had been some speculation that this rare incident could be evidence that the French police - under growing pressure to stop a surge of small boat migrant crossings to the UK - are changing their tactics.

But they have made it clear to the BBC that police have not adopted any new tactics in dealing with small boat launches, that the rules forbidding intervention in the water remains in place and officers must continue to prioritise safety on the beaches. They are allowed to intervene, however, if they believe lives are at immediate risk.

Well-placed sources in France have told us that the procedural changes now being considered will almost certainly focus on the use of patrol boats at sea to intercept the ""taxi-boats"" before they're fully loaded, rather than on approving more aggressive interventions from police on the beaches.

The UK prime minister's official spokesman said the images of French police destroying a boat were ""a significant moment and we welcome this action"".

""We want to see tougher action taken, that's precisely the focus of our work, it is the outcome of that close work that you've seen,"" the spokesman said.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,Y

Throughout the year we have spoken to refugees and asylum seekers who have fled some of the most militarised and poverty-stricken countries in search of a better life.

Last month we also crunched the numbers behind the latest Home Office data which revealed the true number of asylum seekers living in West Midlands hotels.

Article continues below

What does the data say?

We reported in May 2025 how the number of asylum seekers supported by councils across the West Midlands had more than doubled in ten years but still represented a tiny fraction of the population.

Across Birmingham, Solihull and the Black Country, a total of 7,011 people were living in refuges, hotels and temporary accommodation, awaiting a decision from the Home Office on whether they had a right to remain in the country, at the end of December 2024.

The biggest concentrations were in Birmingham, Sandwell and Wolverhampton. The total number of people involved represented less than 0.3 per cent of the population but accounted for significant costs to the hosting council.

BirminghamLive is running a series of stories this week for Refugee Week to give an insight into the experiences of refugees and asylum seekers in the city.

We take a look at some of their stories below:

Kateryna arrived in Birmingham in 2022 after her home town of Berdyansk was captured by Russian forces on the third day of the war.

She came with her daughter as part of the Homes for Ukraine scheme after she was forced to leave her police officer husband behind.

The family have been reunited just twice since the onset of war.

‌



""I left my husband behind as he was forced to leave us,"" Kateryna told BirminghamLive.

""Berdyansk was occupied from the third day of the war. I was really scared for my daughter as she didn't have any opportunities for education and we didn't have heating, the shops were closed and it was extremely risky to stay there.""

Kateryna, 40, and her daughter, now 14, travelled through Europe to arrive in the UK in June 2022.

37,210,‘It’s not quite what I had in mind entering my eighth decade’: the London librarian of Lesbos,https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/jun/16/mavrovouni-refugee-camp-lesbos-library,2025-06-16T12:06:47Z,The Guardian,GB,refugee,"Where do you see yourself in your 70s? Perhaps on a Greek island, a long way from home with a good book or two.

That’s where Ruth Miller is right now, although there’s a twist to the usual tale.

Nine years ago, the Londoner decided to volunteer for a month at a refugee camp on the Greek island of Lesbos. Today, she spends most of her time as the librarian of Mavrovouni camp.

Miller, 71, a former civil servant who worked on simplifying communication in government written materials, has transferred her literacy skills.

“It’s not quite what I had in mind entering my eighth decade but it’s a new challenge and I’m loving it – most of the time, although some days it’s exhausting,” she says.

She volunteers for the NGO Eurorelief and was the driver behind converting a shed covered in metal cladding, a former bike repair workshop, into an oasis of books in 15 different languages.

It contains 2,500 books, many in English, although Miller is always trying to source more books in Farsi, Arabic, Turkish for adults. Many of the refugees speak Arabic and Farsi, but also know Turkish because they have spent extended periods living in Turkey before crossing the Aegean Sea to Greece.

Popular loans include Freud and Dostoevsky in Turkish and George Orwell’s Animal Farm in Farsi. Khaled Hosseini’s The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns are also frequently borrowed. Young refugees are keen on books about famous footballers.

Miller teaches children in the camp the geography of London using the locations of different football teams

“One little boy comes every second day asking for the book on [Virgil] Van Dijk – it went out on loan and hasn’t come back yet. He’s finished [Harry] Kane and [Luis] Suárez,” says Miller.

She is a lifelong Spurs fan and has managed to secure a team kit for some of the children from her beloved club. Some of the children proudly walk around the camp in their Spurs shirts while others wear rival Arsenal’s red shirts.

She teaches children in the camp the geography of London using the locations of different football teams around the capital.

The small shed, stiflingly hot in the summer, is adorned with artwork created by the refugees passing through, including a striking creation by a young refugee artist of a Simurgh bird – known as the king of birds in Persian mythology. For the youngest non-readers, there are ample piles of Lego.

The library opened in March 2024 and has proved popular with a traumatised group of people, many of whom have fled conflict zones in countries like Syria and Afghanistan and have made dangerous sea journeys from Turkey to Greece.

Miller cites US emeritus professor Mason Cooley to describe the joy of having access to books: “Reading gives us someplace to go when we have to stay where we are.”

The library is centrally located within the camp, sandwiched between the units of the Greek cleaning team and Drop in the Ocean, an NGO that provides a laundry service. It has the support of Dimitrios Kantemnidis the managing director of the Lesbos camp.

“In the heart of a refugee camp, a library is not just a room with books, it is a sanctuary of hope and healing,” he says. “It stands as a powerful symbol of what connects us across cultures: the transformative power of stories.”

Sham, 17, a Syrian refugee, is in the camp with her family. She speaks good English and says her favourite books are Michelle Paver’s Chronicles of Ancient Darkness.

“A refugee is a horrible thing to be but this library makes it easier when I’m feeling down. I will never stop reading,” she says.

Her dream is to continue her education and become a children’s social worker. A sign inside the library says: “Today a reader, tomorrow a leader.”

Miller grew up on Hackney council estate and every Saturday morning walked to the local library with her father. Every week they each chose four books to take home.

“For me growing up the library was a special place,” she says, “and I wanted to create a similarly special place for the children in the camp.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

The returns deal is designed as a deterrent to stop the boats. But the announcement of a pilot for a 'one in, one out' scheme is just the first step in what could be a very complicated process. The plan proposes that for each migrant the UK returns to France, another migrant with a strong case for asylum in Britain will come the other way. The Home Office would not speculate on how many people would actually be expelled weekly, noting that the number may vary during the pilot stage of the scheme. During a joint news conference Sir Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron gave this afternoon, the prime minister would not be drawn into the details and said discussing them could undermine ""how this will operate"". Details aside, the agreement is likely to encounter legal, political and practical obstacles, and the need to demonstrate 'proof of concept' will not be straightforward.

However, the legal principle behind the idea is broadly sound. The UN Refugee Convention does not allow migrants to choose where they claim asylum, so there is nothing necessarily unlawful about people being sent from Britain to France for processing. The previous government's Rwanda scheme struggled to get off the ground because the courts were persuaded the East African country was not safe enough to be compliant with the demands of the convention. France, however, would not raise such concerns. Legal challenges are likely to be about the details of the process. Is the system of selection fair?

39,210,Chipboard and carpet: refugee cricket tournament brings a moment of happiness,https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jun/11/refugee-cricket-tournament-project-front-foot-the-spin,2025-06-11T09:34:20Z,The Guardian,GB,refugee,"Next week in Caen, at a baseball practice ground, on a pitch made out of two pieces of chipboard with some carpet stapled on top, a cricket tournament will unroll. Nine teams of refugees, mostly based in Normandy, will fight it out over two days in a series of round-robin T5 tape-ballgames.

The battles will be fierce, the bowling often fast, with added jeopardy if the ball hits the not-very-well-disguised join between the two bits of chipboard. Chris Drew, a Guardian reader who lives locally, will umpire. “You watch county cricket and there is time,” he says via video call from France. “Time is one thing that you don’t have here. It is hit, it is whack, it is run, it is bowl – it is quite something. When they whack the ball, it stays whacked. There are no defensive shots.

“It’s all about having a good time. People being together who want to be together because we love the game. They leave everything else at the door. I never ask anyone where they come from or what their status is – it’s just about bringing a moment of happiness.”

In 2023, the tournament’s first year, it was sponsored by a kebab shop with free kebabs all round. This year Drew will make Welsh cakes and bara brith and his wife cucumber sandwiches. “Somebody will bring a salad and somebody will bring a chicken – it’s a communal thing.”

The community spirit extends further. Teams do not yet know whether they will qualify for the knockout matches on the second day so players will bring tents, and many will camp in local gardens. “It’s all about mucking in,” says Drew. But there are limits. The bowlers will run in from one end of the ground so the houses lining one side of the boundary do not get peppered with unfamiliar flying objects.

That the players have equipment at all is largely down to another group of volunteers. Project Front Foot (PFF) are a registered charity that collects spare kits from clubs and redistributes it to refugee groups. For the first 10 years of its inception, PFF mostly worked in the Dharavi slum in Mumbai, providing equipment for the children living there. They changed tack shortly before Covid to provide for those closer to home – to Germany, where cricket clubs sprung up overnight with the arrival of 1.5m refugees, France, Portugal, Lebanon and London.

It is a labour of love for the project leader, Vic Mills, and his team. In September, they collect from clubs who have something to donate (often because of a change of sponsor), take three or four days going through it all, number it for customs – who post-Brexit need everything individually labelled – and store it in volunteer Tim Gill’s double garage until March.

Then they unpack it all again, refill the spread sheet, stock the van with the right equipment for the right clubs and get on the road in time for the beginning of the northern hemisphere cricket season. This year there were 48 bags and 13 boxes of clothing and equipment, plus a dozen bin liners of sportswear – more than 2,000 items. They included: 48 bats, 30 wicket sets, 86 pairs of pads, 123 pairs of batting gloves, 15 pairs of wicketkeeping gloves, 35 helmets and 74 caps and sun hats.

“We’ve moved up to the largest Transit that the boys feel confident enough driving,” says Mills. “Many of the county clubs have been extremely generous – with particular thanks to Steve Archer and the Yorkshire Cricket Board and the Lancashire Foundation.

“These guys we’re delivering to have nothing, they haven’t got much money or practice kit. We’re finding a home for equipment that would otherwise go to the charity shop or landfill. With a lot of projects, very rarely does all the money allocated get to where it is needed; we can reassure people that we can find a home for pretty much everything.”

On 4 April, the PFF van arrived in Caen and some of the bags were unloaded into another garage, this one belonging to Drew, before a celebratory barbecue for players and volunteers at the house of Caen CC’s president, Julia.

“[PFF] provide us with bats, with pants, with helmets, with jockstraps, everything you could want,” says Drew. “They, like Julia, who is absolutely fantastic, are heroes for providing something for the mental health of these lads.”

Have they had any feedback about the tournament three years in? “The teams want to come back, which I take as a positive sign. There’s a demand, there’s an enjoyment and we’re growing. I’m not saying everything’s perfect. It’s like every cricket club. Not everybody loves everybody all the time.

“But if you come along to the events, you respect everyone else there. The fair play, the spirit of cricket, and that goes outside the bounds of the cricket pitch as well.”

In the current wild and fragmented landscape, there is something comforting in the cricket’s ability to still bring hope and community, as well as grasping around for yet more dollar bills.

41,210,"Syrian refugee, 19, praised after pinning down assailant in Hamburg knife attack",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/may/26/hamburg-knife-attack-syrian-refugee,2025-05-26T13:47:12Z,The Guardian,GB,refugee,"A 19-year-old Syrian refugee in Germany has been hailed as a hero after he pinned down an assailant at Hamburg’s main railway station, helping to halt an attack in which 18 people were injured.

Police on Friday said a 39-year-old German woman had been arrested at the scene of the attack and that she was believed to be in a state of psychological distress. The 18 people injured were later reported to all be in stable condition, while the woman was placed in psychiatric care.

As the city reeled from the incident, the spotlight landed on Muhammad Al Muhammad, who had been heading to his home in Buchholz, 25km from Hamburg, after visiting a friend in the city. He was waiting on the platform for his train when he spotted a woman wielding a knife.

He watched as people began running away from the woman. “I decided to run in the other direction and stop the woman,” he told the German news magazine Der Spiegel.

As he made his way, he saw another man, whom he described as Chechen, kick the woman in the knee, causing her to fall to the ground. “I held her [down] and pressed her hands against her rucksack so she couldn’t get up,” he said. “The woman didn’t scream, she didn’t resist.”

Police arrived a few moments later. As they pointed their weapons towards them, Muhammad moved away from the woman slowly, his hands raised in the air.

Der Spiegel, which said it had verified Muhammad’s identity, noted that the actions of the two men had probably prevented more people from being injured.

News of their interventions soon began to make waves across Germany, with some contrasting it to the sustained efforts by the far-right, anti-immigrant party Alternative für Deutschland, to link migration to crime, even as a recent study by the Munich-based Ifo Institute found there was “no correlation” between migration and higher crime rates.

Many in German media have seemingly also echoed this association; a 2023 analysis found that both print and television media reported five times more on violent crimes when the suspect was a foreigner in Germany, the broadcaster Deutsche Welle noted recently.

Against this backdrop, it was crucial to share the story of Muhammad, who is originally from near Aleppo and arrived in Germany as a refugee in 2022, the journalist and political commentator Gilda Sahebi wrote in Germany’s Die Tageszeitung newspaper.

“One is tempted to say: ‘See? An Arab – his name is Muhammad, no less – is a hero!’” Sahebi wrote. “The political and public debate is now so dripping with racist toxicity, spread by a far-right party and its influencers in media and social media, but also by democratic political and media actors, that it is necessary to tell the story of Muhammad Al Muhammad.”

Muhammad said that, following the attack, he had been questioned by police before eventually making his way home. “The police thanked me and bought me a cappuccino,” he said. “That made me very happy.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
42,210,‘They first come for great acts of culture’: Cate Blanchett sets up grant for displaced film-makers,https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/may/24/cate-blanchett-launches-grant-displaced-film-makers,2025-05-24T07:00:51Z,The Guardian,GB,refugee,"Authoritarian regimes “first come for great acts of culture” when they start to curtail civil liberties, Cate Blanchett warned as she launched a new grant for displaced film-makers.

The two-time Oscar winner and goodwill ambassador for the UN refugee agency (UNHCR), has teamed up with the international film festival Rotterdam’s (IFFR) Hubert Bals Fund to set up the Displacement Film Fund, which will support displaced film-makers or those with experience in refugee storytelling.

Its pilot version is bestowing a grant of €100,000 (£84,000) to five film-makers – Maryna Er Gorbach (Ukraine), Mo Harawe (Somalia, Austria), Hasan Kattan (Syria), Mohammad Rasoulof (Iran) and Shahrbanoo Sadat (Afghanistan) – whose short films will premiere at IFFR 2026.

“History has shown us that when authoritarian regimes start to curtail civil liberties, they first come for great acts of culture,” Blanchett told the Guardian on Friday.

“The metaphorical noses are always removed from statues. I think there’s a cautionary tale to the way artists are silenced; it’s often the thin end of a very thick wedge. And it’s undeniable that this is happening globally now. Oppression comes in many forms, and it’s touching all our lives to greater and lesser degrees.”

In the US, Donald Trump has exerted control over which cultural pursuits the government backs, from taking the reins of the Kennedy Center to targeting “improper ideology” at the Smithsonian Institution. In the UK, Arts Council England became mired in controversy last year when it warned that “political statements” could break funding agreements after discussions with the government about artists speaking out over the Israel-Gaza war.

A recent report by Freemuse said artistic freedom was more threatened globally than ever, citing a culture of “censorship (including self-censorship), imprisonment, travel bans, misuse of defamation, harassment, blasphemy legislation, misuse of anti-terrorism legislation” and violence.

Blanchett said the idea for a new fund was born after “a group of us collected at the global refugee forum 18 months ago, and pledged to one another that we would find a way to highlight displaced perspectives and help them find a more mainstream audience”.

It comes amid a global crisis, with 122.6 million people forcibly displaced owing to war, persecution or human rights abuses, according to the UN. This amounts to one in 67 people worldwide, with 71% of displacements occurring in low- and middle-income nations.

“Forced displacement around the world is one of the greatest challenges that we face as a species, yet it’s often outside the mainstream cultural conversation. When I started working with UNHCR 10 years ago, the numbers of forcibly displaced people around the world were approaching 60 million. They’re now over 120 and rising,” Blanchett said.

“I think it’s very easy to be overwhelmed by those numbers and to disconnect from the individuals behind the numbers. Refugees are often stigmatised, demonised and ostracised. They are often used as political footballs. But during my travels with UNHCR, I’ve heard stories of resilience, and great humour, and have even found portals into my own experience. I found that I have much more in common with these people than the mainstream media would make me believe.”

The Australian actor, who has appeared in dozens of critically acclaimed films, including Tár, Carol and Blue Jasmine – and who created the 2020 Australian series Stateless about unlawful detention in Australia – said it was important to find common themes in other people’s stories and experiences.

Film-making, she said, was a way to “break down” the barriers between us. “We’re told that refugees are coming for our jobs or going to disrupt civil society. But in fact, these people have so much to offer. They’re architects, lawyers, doctors, plumbers, they’re people who are highly skilled, whose lives have been put on hold, but their humanity has not,” Blanchett said.

“These issues get politicised overly quickly, so there was an urgency to reclaim a positive, constructive discourse around them.”

Rasoulof fled Iran after the selection of his film The Seed of the Sacred Fig to take part in the main competition at Cannes last year. His new, untitled short is set after the death of an exiled writer as his family tries to fulfil his wish to be buried according to his will.

The director said: “When I first heard about this fund and its incentives, I felt comfort, seeing that there are people who have this care and concern for us.

“It reminded me of the very specific moment when I was fleeing my country, when I was a step away from crossing the border. I looked at my homeland for one last time, and thought about all the other people who had to leave their roots, their culture, behind, and fight for their freedom of expression.”

Rasoulof said that, despite his experiences of “captivity and interrogation”, he didn’t flee Iran for comfort or security. “It’s not about that. It’s just about being able to go on working, being able to go on expressing myself. This is the case for many artists.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

Nuneaton and Bedworth council is set to to help re-house more refugee families. The Home Office has written to all local authorities to seek participation with further support to accommodate refugee families.

The council has already helped families settle into a life in the borough. According to a council report, it states: ""All of the families resettled in the borough are tenants in the private rented sector.

""There has been no financial cost to the council to be participants, albeit some officer time in respect of identifying, inspecting and supporting the setting up of tenancies and enabling families to take up suitable and affordable private sector tenancies.""

It goes on to add that the scheme, locally, has received praise. ""The welcome and support from the local community received by our families has been recognised by partners as excellent, partner agencies and the local community have played a vital part in helping these vulnerable families settle, feel safe and feel valued members of the wider community,"" the report explains.

Now the council is being asked to help provide further support to accommodate refugee families. It says that Warwickshire County Council has collated data and has recommended to the Home Office that all councils in Warwickshire pledge a further three families each under the revised Afghan Resettlement Scheme with the caveat of local council approval.

The county council is suggesting that local councils endorse the pledge because, if not, the Home Office could mandate that they support an 'unknown number of families and supply transitional accommodation that is currently not enforced.'

So council officers are recommending the council agrees to help support another three families. ""The resettlement of the families to date has been a great success, not only for the families themselves but also for the wider community in which they now live and work,"" the Town Hall report explains.

""The addition of more refugee families to the borough will further complement the growing and valued members of the community.""

It concludes: ""To welcome further families will serve to add to the cultural diversity of the borough and demonstrate the council’s commitment to helping vulnerable refugees to start again in a safe and supportive environment.""

The final decision will be made at a single cabinet meeting on Thursday, May 29.",GNews,,,not found,,,,"coventry telegraph, Coventry Telegraph, coventrytelegraph.net, coventry live, coventrylive",not found,,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,coventrytelegraph.net,,coventry telegraph,248,UK,,,,
44,210,Bhutanese Nepalis fled ethnic cleansing for the US. Trump is returning them to the refugee camps,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/21/us-deports-bhutanese-refugee-stateless-limbo,2025-05-21T12:00:27Z,The Guardian,GB,refugee,"Aasis Subedi, a Bhutanese Nepali refugee, finds himself back in the same Nepal refugee camp he spent part of his youth, once again stateless.

Last month, Subedi and two dozen community members from across the US were deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) officers to Bhutan, the tiny Himalayan country where they had never previously set foot. At least four, including Subedi, were immediately rejected by Bhutanese authorities and then expelled to India, where they fled to a refugee camp in Nepal.

“I have nothing right now. They brought us in [to Bhutan] without any documents,” he says from one of the three Beldangi refugee camps in the south-east of Nepal, where he is using his father’s cellphone.

Subedi had been serving jail time for a third-degree felony offense committed in Columbus, Ohio, before he was put on a plane and deported via New Jersey.

Subedi is one of the more than 100,000 Bhutanese Nepalis who fled ethnic cleansing and were made stateless by the Bhutanese government who stripped them of their citizenship rights in the 1980s. Since 2008, more than 90,000 have been resettled in the US.

But the Trump administration has upended life for the community.

“Bhutan is still not safe for our community members to return [to]. It is a matter of putting our lives at risk … Now, people are going through the cycle of being stateless again,” says Robin Gurung of Asian Refugees United.

Several of the deported people are believed to be missing in India.

Ice told Global Press Journal that Subedi was deported under a “targeted enforcement operation”. Green card holders – Subedi is a legal permanent resident – can be deported having been found guilty of a serious crime but only after having the opportunity to plead their case in court and once the US government has shown “clear and convincing evidence” that the person can be deported. US laws forbid the deportation of individuals to countries where their safety may be at risk.

“Most of the folks who have been deported have already served their time. For me, that is the matter of concern,” says Gurung. “They served their time, they were in their communities, providing for their families, their children, and now they are gone.”

Thousands of Bhutanese Nepalis have settled in parts of Ohio and Pennsylvania that faced major economic struggles and population loss due to the 2008 Great Recession. About 8,000 Bhutanese Nepali people now live in Reynoldsburg, a city outside Columbus, making up about one-fifth of the population.

Along the suburb’s main thoroughfare, East Main Street, Bhutanese Americans have opened up more than 30 businesses ranging from hair salons to restaurants.

“A lot of the community works at local Amazon and FedEx facilities. Those kinds of jobs were very attractive for folks, and the schools in Reynoldsburg are good,” says Bhuwan Pyakurel who came to Reynoldsburg in 2016 and has since become America’s first-ever Nepali-Bhutanese elected official.

“Many of those businesses were closed before we came here [and] we came and revived them. Cricket is a big thing for the Bhutanese community when it wasn’t known here in the past. Now the city is in the process of building a new cricket field.”

While towns and cities across the Sun belt have grown significantly in recent years, northern states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and beyond have struggled to retain and attract residents.

As a result, immigrants have played an important role in helping local economies grow, creating a tax base for city authorities and adding vibrancy to a region working to shed its Rust belt past. Nextdoor in Pennsylvania, about 40,000 Bhutanese Nepalis live in the cities of Harrisburg and Lancaster. Harrisburg has lost nearly half of its population since 1950, though in recent years that decline has been halted.

But now a crippling fear has gripped immigrant communities across the country.

Pyakurel, who was elected to Reynoldsburg’s city council in 2019 having lived in a refugee camp in Nepal for 18 years, says he now fields five to 10 phone calls a day from worried local Bhutanese Nepali residents, many asking for guidance.

“People are wondering if they should apply for their citizenship or wait for three years, if they should renew certain documentation,” he says. Last month, the Palestinian green card holder and Columbia University student Mohsen Mahdawi was detained at a naturalization interview and deportation proceedings against him were enacted. On 30 April, Mahdawi was released.

“Nowadays, I carry my passport with me all the time,” says Pyakurel. “Even though I’m a [city council] representative here, I don’t look like a citizen to many Ice officers.”

Subedi came to the US through a government refugee relocation program in July 2016 and had been living and working as a machine operator in Pennsylvania before his arrest in Columbus last July.

Now 7,700 miles from home, he has little to do but sit all day in the refugee camp, where he lives in a bamboo-made hut – the very same camp he spent the first two years of his life and where his father still lives. The arrival of him and three others deported from the US caused a stir at the camp, which drew the attention of the Nepali police, who detained him for several weeks as his legal status was investigated.

This month, his daughter turns three years old. He says his family has no money to assist him in the refugee camp in part because his wife stopped working when their child was born.

He says he doesn’t know if he’ll be able to come back to the US.

“I want to come back. I have family, my kids,” Subedi says.

When 17-year-old Angelica arrived at the U.S.-Mexico border in November, her older sister Deisy began the process of applying to be Angelica’s sponsor so that the sisters could live together. Angelica was pregnant at the time, and Deisy, who has a young daughter, was eager to care for her sister and the new baby.

Deisy consented to a home study and provided the Office of Refugee Resettlement, the government agency responsible for unaccompanied undocumented minors, with her passport and fingerprints — which she was assured would not be used in relation to immigration enforcement.

But before the sisters could be reunited, President Donald Trump took office and his administration changed the sponsorship rules, making it nearly impossible for undocumented adults to sponsor children. Despite Angelica and her infant daughter having a loving home awaiting them, they are trapped in an ORR shelter.

“There is nothing that I want more than to live with my sister,” Angelica wrote in an April court declaration. “I don’t think it is fair that the government keeps me in custody when I could live safely with my sister. I want my baby to grow up with family, not in a shelter,” she wrote in a separate declaration that same month.

Angelica is one of five migrant children who are named plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit against the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses ORR. The children, identified in court records only by their first names, are asking a federal judge to block the new sponsorship restrictions so that they can leave ORR shelters and live with their loved ones.

Trump administration officials have claimed that their harsh immigration policies are aimed at keeping violent criminals out of the country. But many of the people forcibly removed from the U.S. since Trump’s inauguration entered the country legally and have no criminal record. And several of the administration’s immigration policies specifically endanger children and other vulnerable populations seeking safety in the U.S.

More than 20 years ago, Congress decided that unaccompanied kids who cross the border should be cared for by an agency focused on their well-being rather than an immigration enforcement agency. Lawmakers tasked ORR with this duty and directed the agency to place children “in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.”

In recent years, kids typically spent about a month in an ORR shelter until they were released to an adult sponsor — who could use a foreign passport or identification card and a birth certificate to verify their identity.

But since March, ORR requires prospective sponsors to present either a form of U.S. identification or a foreign passport indicating legal status in the U.S. The next month, ORR added proof-of-income requirements that are unavailable to people who cannot legally work in the U.S. and are paid in cash.

“What they are asking for now — if you are undocumented, it’s literally weeding you out. Even if you are the parent, which is unheard of,” Karina Ramos, a managing attorney at Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said in an interview. Immigrant Defenders, a named plaintiff in the suit, represents nearly 2,000 unaccompanied children in immigration cases.

Even if a prospective sponsor is able to provide the necessary documentation under the new rules, ORR is simultaneously expanding the amount of biometric information it collects on sponsors and members of their households — creating a disincentive for people without legal status to apply.

Starting in February, ORR began requiring adult sponsors and members of their households to submit to fingerprint-based background checks. The following month, the agency began requiring DNA testing in cases where a sponsor claims to be biologically related to the child. At the same time, ORR has begun assisting the Department of Homeland Security with immigration enforcement operations, ProPublica reported earlier this month.

“It’s creating such a chilling effect,” Ramos said of ORR’s new biometric data requirements.

As a result, kids are left stranded in ORR shelters indefinitely, despite having family members and friends eager to care for them at home. In fiscal years 2021 through 2024, kids remained in ORR custody for an average of 27 to 33 days. By February, that number had climbed to 49 days. In March, it was 112 days. For April, it was 217 days. Meanwhile, the number of children released from ORR custody each month has plummeted. In February, 1,858 children were released, in March, it was 343 children, and in April, just 45 children were released.

During Trump’s first term, ORR temporarily implemented a narrower set of sponsorship restrictions, which also increased lengths of stay in ORR shelters. This “resulted in higher levels of defiance, hopelessness, and frustration among children, along with more instances of self-harm and suicidal ideation,” according to a 2019 HHS Inspector General report.

“Children think, ‘My mom doesn’t really want me, maybe. Maybe they’re not trying hard enough — just give them the paper that they’re asking for. Why is this so difficult?’” Ramos said. “There’s a lot of emotional distress,” she continued, noting that some of the kids have even talked about voluntarily leaving the country so they can get out of the shelter.

ORR did not respond to a request for comment, but Tony Biswas, the director of the agency’s Unaccompanied Alien Children Policy Division, said in a declaration that changes to sponsorship requirements are intended to prevent fraud and abuse.

Angelica’s baby was due in February, and she expected they would be released to Deisy in April, after the baby was vaccinated. But in March, Angelica’s case manager told Deisy that her foreign passport was no longer an acceptable form of identification.

When she was unable to produce the required documentation, the case manager recommended she withdraw her sponsorship application and find someone else — even a potential stranger. But everyone Deisy approached was “too afraid,” she wrote in a declaration. “No one I asked would promise to sponsor her, out of fear that it would lead to them being arrested or deported.”

Biswas, the ORR official, suggested in his declaration that Angelica was still in ORR custody because an adult in Deisy’s home was arrested in late January for child sex abuse. But Deisy informed ORR of the arrest, and the agency conducted a home study to ensure he no longer lived in the home, the plaintiff’s lawyers wrote in a court filing.

“This whole process has made me feel terrible,” Angelica wrote in her declaration. “I was going to get to leave, but they changed all the rules when we were just waiting for vaccines for my daughter. And now I’m stuck here, and I want nothing more than to leave with my baby.”

Another plaintiff, identified in court records as Leo, arrived in the U.S. in February 2023 and was released to his sister after spending about 41 days in ORR custody. He was happy living with his sister in Georgia, where he attended school, played sports with friends and visited the lake and waterpark nearby. But in March, he was detained in another ORR shelter after being taken into ICE custody for driving without a license, Biswas wrote.

“It’s even harder being detained again than it was the first time, since I had the experience of getting to be with family and then had that taken away,” Leo wrote in a declaration. “Sometimes I think that if I start to feel sad and think too much about why this is happening to me, I will get sick. I tell myself that I must have the maturity to accept things head on and see what God has in store,” the 17-year-old boy continued.

Small boats due to be used by people smugglers in the English Channel have been seized from a lorry in Bulgaria.

National Crime Agency (NCA) officers worked with Bulgarian partners to seize the 25 inflatable boats, which had just crossed the Kapitan Andreevo checkpoint.

More than 25,000 migrants have crossed the Channel so far in 2025, the first time that number has been reached in July, according to official figures.

An illegal migrant man who deliberately drove at three people, killing two, has been detained under the Mental Health Act.

Pedestrian Leo Moran and cyclist Joel Carriedo died in Coventry after they were hit by Emiljano Kasaj's Mercedes on the morning of September 3, 2023.

‌



A third man suffered serious injuries requiring hospital treatment during the rampage which ended when Kasaj struck a house and was arrested almost an hour later in a garden.

Kasaj pleaded guilty in March this year to one count of attempted murder and two counts of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility, Warwick Crown Court heard.

Following a hearing at the same court today (June 12), the 33-year-old Albanian was handed a hybrid order under the Mental Health Act.

He was sentenced to life, with a minimum of nine years and four months.

Kasaj, of no fixed address, is currently being held in a secure mental health facility, and will only be transferred to prison to serve the remainder of his sentence if he is deemed well enough.

‌



The court heard Kasaj was suffering from what was believed to be a psychotic episode at the time of the collisions.

When he was arrested, he was rambling incoherently, although he did admit to killing the two men.

Detective Inspector Phil Poole, who led the investigation, said: ""This was a horrific incident which robbed two families of their loved ones and caused long-lasting injuries to the third.

""We hope the conclusion of this case can bring some closure to the families of those affected.

""We'd also like to thank the many members of the public who came forward as witnesses and shared what they saw with us - your assistance was invaluable.""

""We've often been lectured by people all over the place about how the United States needs to continue to be a beacon for those who are oppressed abroad. Well, here's an example where we're doing that,"" Rubio said on ""Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.""

Last week, 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community — White South Africans largely descended from Dutch settlers — arrived in the U.S., after President Trump earlier this year directed his government to allow South Africans of European descent, and Afrikaners in particular, to be resettled through the U.S. refugee program.

The White House, along with South African native Elon Musk, have claimed that White South Africans have been the target of oppression by the country's government, pointing to a law that they argue is racially motivated and allows the government to seize privately held land under certain conditions. Until 1994, South Africa was under minority white rule, enforcing the brutal system of apartheid on the country's Black majority.

President Trump signed an executive order in February directing his government to halt aid to South Africa and he has claimed a genocide is underway in the country, saying some white farmers have been killed. Asked whether there was evidence of a genocide, Rubio said ""I think there's evidence, absolutely, that people have been murdered, that people have been forcibly removed from their properties.""

South Africa does not release crime figures by race. According to BBC News, there were 12 people killed in farm attacks of the 6,953 people who were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of those 12, one was a farmer, while the others were farm dwellers or employees.

Rubio added that ""these are people that, on the basis of their race, are having their properties taken away from them, and their lives being threatened and, in some cases, killed,""

He urged that ""to move here from half a world away and leave behind the only homeland you've ever known, that's not something people do lightly,"" arguing that ""these people are doing it for a reason.""

""So we welcome them to the United States, and I think there may be more coming soon,"" he said.

Ramaphosa's office said the visit will provide a ""platform to reset the strategic relationship between the two countries."" The statement said Rampahosa, who is the current president of the G20, and President Trump will meet on Wednesday, May 21.

The White House has not yet commented on the meeting.

The visit comes amid renewed tensions between Ramaphosa and the White House as 59 people from South Africa's Afrikaner community arrived in the U.S. earlier this week. Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landeau said upon their arrival in Washington that they had faced ""egregious discrimination"" in South Africa.

State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce called the Afrikaners a ""vulnerable group facing unjust racial discrimination in South Africa.""

Ramaphosa rejected the Trump administration's characterization of the treatment as ""not true,"" according to BBC News.

On Tuesday, Ramaphosa called those leaving for the U.S. ""cowardly,"" saying, ""When you run away you are a coward.""

Who are Afrikaners?

Afrikaners are White South Africans of Dutch descent who have lived in South Africa for four centuries. In addition to English, Afrikaners have their own language, Afrikaans, which has its roots in Dutch and is one of the 12 official languages of South Africa.

In 1948, as South Africa was in the process of gaining independence from Britain, the White minority created the system of apartheid, allowing only White South Africans to vote and govern. As well as being denied political power, Black South Africans also faced harsh restrictions on owning land and many were forcibly segregated into settlements.

That ended in 1994, when all South Africans were allowed to vote for the first time, leading to the end of minority White rule. Nelson Mandela's African National Congress won a majority, and he became the country's first Black president. The ANC has been in power since 1994, but scandals have harmed the party in recent years and it did not win a majority in the 2024 election, forcing Ramaphosa to form a coalition government.

Thirty years after apartheid ended, White South Africans on average still enjoy a higher standard of living than Black South Africans, with research from the South Africa Human Rights Commission showing just 1% of White South Africans are considered poor, compared to 64% of the Black African population.

Why are Afrikaners claiming refugee status?

In February, Ramaphosa signed a new law that allowed the state to seize land without compensation, in situations classified under the legislation as ""just and equitable and in the public interest.""

Although the wording of the law was vague and did not reference White South Africans, many believed it was targeting them since they control most of the country's land. South Africa's government has strongly denied any land confiscations or racially motivated discrimination, saying the law targets land not being used or not serving the public interest.

Some have also pointed to attacks on South African farmers in recent years. U.S Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau, who met the first group of Afrikaners admitted to the country, recently claimed they faced ""egregious and targeted threats."" The South African government, however, has said those attacks were a result of border crime issues and were not racially motivated.

Mr. Trump and adviser Elon Musk, who is a White South African native, have claimed the attacks and potential loss of land amounts to ""White genocide.""

In February, Mr. Trump signed an executive order to prioritize the resettlement of Afrikaners under the refugee resettlement program. Access to that program for many other groups was frozen by Mr. Trump on his first day in office, although that executive order allowed for exemptions to be considered on a case-by-case basis.

While Afrikaners make up only about half of South Africa's White population, Mr. Trump's executive order granting refugee status only mentions Afrikaners.

According to the U.S. embassy in South Africa, individuals who meet the following requirements can apply for refugee stays:

Must be of South African nationality; and

Must be of Afrikaner ethnicity or be a member of a racial minority in South Africa; and

Must be able to articulate a past experience of persecution or fear of future persecution.

On Monday, Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau personally welcomed almost 60 white South Africans claiming refugee status to the United States. President Donald Trump has justified their admission by claiming that Afrikaners, descendants of white colonial settlers, face genocide in the majority Black country. That is false.

That same day, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem announced that temporary protected status for Afghan nationals in this country will be allowed to expire on May 20. Unless they have a separate immigration status that allows them to remain, Afghan nationals will be subject to deportation starting July 12.

According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, a refugee is someone who “demonstrates that they were persecuted or fear persecution due to race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group.” Applicants undergo extensive vetting in a third country before being allowed into the United States.

The Trump administration suspended refugee admissions in January, and the moratorium remains in force. But for some reason, Trump has made an exception for Afrikaners, who come from a country not enduring a civil or cross-border war.

Afrikaners are a small minority in South Africa, about 7% of the population. Their forebears enforced an oppressive system of racial segregation called apartheid, which ended in 1991.

Three decades later, Afrikaners still own a disproportionate share of the nation’s farmland. Race-related violence happens — just as it does here — but that is crime, not genocide.

Trump also argues Afrikaners deserve refugee status because of a new law that he said allows the South African government to seize white farmers’ land without paying for it. The “expropriation” law Trump referenced actually resembles eminent domain laws in this country.

Meanwhile, people fleeing widespread war, rape or famine in places like Myanmar and South Sudan languish in third countries. At least 25,000 Afghan refugees, whose prior relationship with the U.S. puts them at risk in their homeland, remain stranded in third countries, said Shawn VanDiver, a U.S. Navy veteran and president of AfghanEvac. Another 50,000 have yet to escape Afghanistan.

Afrikaners should be able to apply for refugee status, but they shouldn’t receive special treatment, as this first group did. These Afrikaners didn’t have to flee to a third country before they applied. The vetting process, which often takes two years, went at light speed for them. Trump made Afrikaners eligible for refugee status in February and Afrikaner refugees arrived in May. The administration warped the process to favor them.

In contrast, by declining to extend TPS for Afghan nationals, the administration is saying that Afghanistan is safe for returning nationals. It isn’t. In fact, one organization Noem cited to defend ending TPS shows that Afghanistan is more dangerous than South Africa.

These decisions do not align with or promote American interests or values, and only erode respect for this nation’s leadership in the world.

A group of 59 white South Africans arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport on Monday afternoon, greeted by U.S. officials as newly admitted refugees.

The group—members of the Afrikaner minority, who once ruled South Africa during apartheid—was brought to the U.S. on a State Department-chartered flight and received by Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Troy Edgar, according to NBC News.

Their arrival raised eyebrows for one major reason: while the Trump administration continues to block refugees from countries like Afghanistan, Sudan, the Republic of Congo and Myanmar, this group was admitted under a special carve-out. A February executive order from President Trump cited “race-based discrimination” and “racially discriminatory property confiscation” as the reason for allowing them entry.

The first group of Afrikaners from South Africa to arrive for resettlement listen to remarks from US Deputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau and US Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Troy Edgar (both out of frame), after they arrived at Washington Dulles International Airport in Dulles, Virginia, on May 12, 2025. President Donald Trump on Monday defended the decision to resettle a group of white Afrikaners in the United States as refugees, saying they were fleeing a “terrible situation” in South Africa. Trump’s remarks to reporters at the White House came just hours before an initial group of around 50 Afrikaners was set to arrive at an airport outside Washington.

“These refugees tell quite harrowing stories of the violence that they faced in South Africa that was not redressed by the authorities,” Landau told reporters. “The United States, as we were proud to say, has stood for equal justice under law.”

The executive order claimed that the South African government had seized land from white farmers without compensation and accused the country of showing a “shocking disregard of its citizens’ rights.” Trump even ordered a freeze on U.S. aid to South Africa — a move backed by Elon Musk, who now leads the administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa disputed the U.S. government’s characterization of the country’s new land law, writing on X in February that the Expropriation Act was “not a confiscation instrument, but a constitutionally mandated legal process that ensures public access to land in an equitable and just manner.”

Still, Trump and some of his officials — including Musk, called what was happening to Afrikaners a “genocide.” That’s not just misleading, say experts — it’s dangerous.

The data doesn’t back it up, either. While farm attacks are real and tragic, they’re not racially one-sided. Between 2020 and 2024, about 101 of the 225 people killed on farms in South Africa were Black farmworkers, according to The New York Times. White farmers were among the victims too — but so were many of the workers who keep those farms running.

However, U.S. officials said the exception made for Afrikaner refugees was consistent with U.S. interests. “From the very beginning, the president’s pause of the U.S. refugee program was subject to exceptions when it was determined to be in the interest of the United States,” Landau said, adding that the group “could be assimilated easily into our country.”

The administration has pushed back on suggestions that the decision was race-related. “Farmers are being killed,” Trump told reporters on Monday. “They happen to be white. Whether they are white or Black makes no difference to me.”

White House Deputy Chief of Staff and Homeland Security Adviser Stephen Miller also defended the carve-out, saying, “This is race-based persecution. The refugee program is not intended as a solution for global poverty, and historically, it has been used that way.”

Faith leaders, human rights groups and South African officials are pushing back. Chrispin Phiri, a spokesperson for South Africa’s Ministry of International Relations, didn’t mince words: “It’s politically motivated,” he said. “It’s designed to question our constitutional democracy — a democracy that rose out of actual persecution under apartheid.”

Even the Episcopal Church, which helps resettle refugees, refused to be involved. They were asked by the federal government to assist the Afrikaner families — and said no.

Presiding Bishop Sean Rowe explained the church’s decision in an open letter: “It has been painful to watch one group of refugees, selected in a highly unusual manner, receive preferential treatment over many others who have been waiting in refugee camps or dangerous conditions for years.”

Rowe added that many of the people now being turned away — especially from places like Afghanistan and Iraq — had risked their lives to support the U.S. military. “I am saddened and ashamed,” he wrote.

Back in South Africa, some fear this move could stir up even more racial tension.

“Calling this a ‘genocide’ is not just incorrect — it’s inflammatory,” Thula Simpson, a historian at the University of Pretoria told NBC News. “It raises the stakes in a country still healing from the deep wounds of apartheid. The outcome is unpredictable.”

Still, U.S. officials say they stand by the decision. “The South African government has not done what we feel is appropriate to guarantee the rights of these citizens to live in peace with their fellow South Africans, which is why, under our domestic law, they were given refugee status,” Landau said.",GNews,,,not found,,,,"Essence, essence.com",not found,https://ground.news/interest/essence,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Lean Left,essence.com,,essence,192,USA,,,,
53,215,Inside the Extraordinary Contradictions in Trump’s Immigration Policies,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/13/us/politics/trump-refugees-white-south-africa-aghanistan.html,2025-05-13T20:46:43Z,The New York Times,US,refugee,"On the same day that dozens of white South Africans arrived in the United States as refugees, at the invitation of President Trump himself, his administration said thousands of Afghans could be deported starting this summer.

Mr. Trump’s immigration policies are riddled with contradictions, epitomized by Monday’s arrival of a chartered jet, paid for by the American government, carrying dozens of Afrikaners who say they are facing racial discrimination at home.

The Trump administration’s focus on white Afrikaners, an ethnic minority that ruled during apartheid, is particularly striking as it effectively bans most other refugees and targets legal and illegal immigrants alike for deportation. Those include Afghans who were granted “temporary protected status” after the disastrous U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, many of whom had risked their lives to help American forces.

Mr. Trump’s hard line on immigration helped propel him back to the White House as voters from both parties expressed frustration over the issue. He has promised to carry out the largest deportation operation in U.S. history, and one of the first executive orders of his second term was to suspend refugee resettlement in the United States.",GNews,-8.05,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-times-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.05,"the new york times, New York Times, NYT, nytimes.com, NY Times",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-york-times/,https://ground.news/interest/the-new-york-times,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/new-york-times,LEFT-CENTER (-4.1),HIGH (1.4),USA,,Newspaper,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,The New York Times Company,1851,-2.2,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,nytimes.com,,the new york times,59,USA,,,,

A 'corrupt' Manchester-based Home Office employee who took more than £3,000 in bribes to grant an asylum claim has been jailed for four-and-a-half years.

Imran Mulla, 39, took £3,500 in bribes from Bangladeshi national Nural Amin Begh, 23, to grant his asylum claim after it was initially refused. In February 2024, asylum seeker Begh was contacted by Mulla the day after his asylum claim was refused.

‌



Six days later, Begh transferred £1,500 into Mulla’s bank account. Then, Mulla breached policy to allocate Begh’s case to himself and granted the asylum application.

‌



Begh continued to transfer more money over the next few months, to a total of £3,500. At Preston Crown Court, Mulla, who considered asylum claims as part of a team in Manchester, pleaded guilty to assisting unlawful immigration to the UK, securing unauthorised access to computer material with intent to commit or facilitate and offence, and three counts of bribery.

He was jailed for four and a half years at Preston Crown Court on Monday (June 23). Begh, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to assist unlawful immigration to the UK and two counts of bribery, was jailed for 18 months.

Mulla, from Blackburn, was foiled after contacting another target, a Turkish national who was waiting to hear if his asylum had been granted, on March 7, 2024. After ringing the asylum seeker, and giving a false name, he told the man his application was likely to be refused but that he could help if he paid him £2,000, reports Lancs Live.

The Turkish national then contacted his immigration solicitor. Mulla was arrested 12 days later, on March 19. He made no comment in police interview.

Frances Killeen, senior crown prosecutor for CPS North West, said: “Imran Mulla was in a trusted position in the asylum team at the Home Office. He abused that trust to line his own pockets by offering to change the outcome of asylum applications for money. I hope this case sends a clear message – the CPS is committed to working closely with law enforcement and immigration authorities to stamp out corruption.”

Kidanemariam escaped indefinite conscription in one of the world's most secretive countries - he shares his story with BirminghamLive ahead of Refugee Week

Runner From Eritrea Now Living In Birmingham

A Birmingham refugee who fled one of the most secretive countries in the world is making a new life in the Midlands.

Keen runner Kidanemariam left Eritrea in 2015 - dubbed Africa's North Korea - after serving years of military conscription, leaving his parents and siblings in search of freedom and a better life.

‌



He made a long and risky journey to get to Birmingham, transiting through multiple European countries to reach safety in the UK.

‌

Now the 32-year-old is forging a new life in the city, despite carrying the scars of trauma, including undergoing emergency back surgery in Belgium after falling in a camp, losing access to his running coach and standing in the athletics community in Netherlands, and being ostracized by communities in Europe who believed refugees had brought Covid in from Italy.

Kidanemariam shared his story with BirminghamLive ahead of Refugee Week, which runs from June 16 to 22, to give an insight into why he left his repressive homeland.

Eritrea is often compared to North Korea, with journalists locked up, citizens subject to indefinite military conscription and no constitution.

""So many people in Eritrea are professionals, when you finish 12th grade you have military training,"" Kidanemariam told us.

""We don't have enough schools, we didn't go to university, it was all closed.

‌



""We didn't have a future, so many great students in my country, the problems with the dictatorship are forcing people out.

Kidanemariam arrived in Birmingham eight months ago and has shared his experiences with BirminghamLive ahead of refugee week. (Image: Birmingham Live )

""Eritrea is a very good place to live [in terms of the environment and people], we have the Red Sea, but the problem is [more than] 30 years under one president, we don't have an economy, constitution, election, free press, so many journalists are locked up.

‌



""The problems are political.""

President Isaias Afwerki has governed Eritrea since it won independence in 1993 but cancelled elections in 1997, closed down the free press in 2001 and, according to a 2021 Human Rights Watch report, has failed to implement critical human rights reforms.

UK university student and and Eritrean refugee Al-Zubier Adem said in a 2023 Amnesty interview: ""The Eritrean regime is not nice. You have to do military service or leave the country – there are no other options.""

‌



Kidanemariam remains positive about the future, determined to pursue an athletic career - sparked by his love of running by the Red Sea in his home country.

""I was running in Italy, Netherlands, Belgium, I like running, it is my dream to go to the Olympics,"" he explained.

""My dream is to become an athlete, we will see.""

‌



Kidanemariam has caused a stir in West Midlands and English running circles, winning Warrington park run five times, Telford 10k twice, and Birmingham park run three times, where he raised cash for Birmingham Children's Hospital.

Since arriving in Birmingham from Warrington earlier this year, he has been supported by ACH, an organisation that empowers refugees and migrants in the UK to lead self-sufficient and ambitious lives.

‌



ACH has offices and and supported accommodation in Birmingham, Coventry, Solihull, Wolverhampton and Bristol and focusses on helping refugees and migrants navigate the UK system and get into work.

BirminghamLive previously reported from inside one of its hostels, read more on that here.

""ACH supports us, they help us with education, we had a community film screening, meetings, they helped me find shoes and clothes for running or when I need something like how to apply for things on the computer,"" said Kidanemariam.

‌



Kidanemariam's athletics talent was spotted immediately in the Netherlands and he was given a coach, however he was sent back to Italy.

""I lost everything,"" he recalled.

""They call us the African North Korea, I never wanted to leave my country.

‌



""Ten years I have not seen my family.""

Kidanemariam arrived in Birmingham eight months ago and has shared his experiences with BirminghamLive ahead of refugee week. He lives in ACH housing in the city

Kidanemariam now lives in ACH-supported accommodation in Birmingham and volunteers as a deacon at a city church, helping with Sunday school.

‌



He currently has refugee status and is in the system to apply for indefinite leave to remain and eventual citizenship.

He said: ""It has been a difficult struggle with many challenges.

""I never give up, when you give up you lose everything, life is short.""

An ACH spokesperson said: ""For us Kidanemariam’s story is a real example of what we mean when we talk about the power of community support. It shows that with determination, support, and the right opportunities, people can overcome adversity and achieve incredible things.

""At ACH, we are committed to standing by individuals like Kidanemariam, helping them unlock their potential and achieve success in all areas of life.

The local council and Police and Crime Commissioner have issued damning statements

Halton Council has turned on the recently elected Reform UK MP for Runcorn and Helsby. Figures including the leader of the council and Cheshire Police and Crime Commissioner have slammed Sarah Pochin for repeating claims that they say are not based in fact.

In damning statements, they have jointly called for her to retract claims that houses of multiple occupancies (HMOs) in Runcorn are hotbeds for serious crime, drug dealing, trafficking, prostitution and grooming and report any crimes that she claims to know about to police.

‌



In her maiden speech to the House of Commons, Ms Pochin claimed there were a number of ""illegal immigrants"" in Runcorn and HMOs are ""breeding grounds for organised crime"".

‌



Leader of Halton Council, Cllr Mike Wharton, said: ""It is unfortunate that we as a Local Authority have to date never been approached for information by Mrs Pochin.""

He continued: ""Our communities deserve factual information, and we are here to provide that to them. Halton Borough Council stand willing to provide factual information to Mrs Pochin, in order to assist her in her duties to advocate for and assist her constituents in Runcorn.""

Despite these comments, Sarah Pochin said she has spoken with constituents who have raised concerns about the HMOs, as well as reporting this to Cheshire Police.

Dan Price, Cheshire Police and Crime Commissioner, also claims he has never been approached by Ms Pochin. He said: ""I simply don’t recognise the picture that Sarah Pochin tries to paint of Runcorn – it’s not based on reality.

""On several occasions Mrs Pochin has stated to have seen CCTV providing evidence of criminal activity. To date, no reports or evidence has been provided to Cheshire Police or to my office by Mrs Pochin, despite the MP having had several opportunities to do so.""

The group also said Ms Pochin claimed there has been a rise in the number of people seeking asylum moving into social housing and as a result putting pressure on local services.

‌



Ms Pochin also claimed this happened after a decision to close the hotel in which they had been housed on the outskirts of Runcorn. The group said this is not correct.

Ms Pochin told the ECHO: ""One of the clearest messages from the Runcorn and Helsby by-election was how fed up residents are with being ignored. They are tired of being silenced for speaking the truth.

""My constituents are raising serious concerns about the rise in HMOs housing asylum seekers. We’ve received first-hand accounts from those living next door, backed up by CCTV footage of late-night knife and drug crime, intimidating behaviour by gang members and unacceptable noise.

‌



""Despite the PCC claiming to be unaware of this, which in itself is a concern, we have crime reference numbers from Cheshire Police. This isn’t hearsay - it’s happening in our community. And if you live next door to one of these HMO’s, it’s a living nightmare.

""Labour Councillors response? Arrogance. Dismissal. Silence. Well I am listening — and I am standing up for the people who have been taken for granted for far too long.""

Halton Cllr Andrea Wall, Executive Board Member for Community Safety, said in a statement: “The claims made about the number and housing arrangements for asylum seekers in Runcorn are factually incorrect.

“The people who previously lived in the hotel have been moved to another region. Government officials have also confirmed that there will be no further increase in Asylum Seeker numbers in Halton.

57,210,They planned to seek asylum. Trump’s policies have left them stranded at the US-Mexico border,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/families-legal-asylum-cbpone-border-trump,2025-06-19T14:00:07Z,The Guardian,GB,asylum,"Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration upended lives on inauguration day when he abruptly closed the border for many who were just on the Mexican side of the border planning to cross into the US legally. Five months on, some hold on to hope, others are giving up.

A family from El Salvador seeking asylum was left stranded at the border within sight of Texas only three days into the second Trump administration. A grandfather, his daughter, his niece, her husband and two of his grandchildren had done things “the right way”, by requesting one of the highly limited appointments with US Customs and Border Protection, from the Mexican side using the Biden-era mobile phone app called CBPOne. But on 20 January, Trump signed an executive order cancelling all scheduled appointments, including theirs on 23 January at noon.

Trump crushed the family’s access to seek asylum, along with their dreams – and those of 30,000 other migrants who had been given prized appointments through the app. Many of them were fleeing combinations of extreme violence, authoritarianism and poverty in El Salvador, Haiti, Cuba, Venezuela or within Mexico.

The Salvadorian family was turned back by US officials on the international bridge connecting Reynosa in northern Mexico to McAllen in south Texas.

Bewildered and upset, they did not know where to turn.

That was when they ran into a local pastor, Héctor Silva, who runs two migrant shelters in Reynosa, known as Senda de Vida 1 and 2, that together can hold up to 5,000 people. He took the family under his wing. Their names are being withheld so as not to jeopardize their safety.

“In El Salvador we will always be at risk since our brother was killed by gang members,” said one of the women. He was murdered back in 2014 when he was 18. “My father recently worked as an Uber driver but he was being extorted,” she added. And she herself had been unemployed.

Shelters like Silva’s were overcrowded a few years ago, but as Joe Biden swung further right on immigration and tightened access, numbers dropped. With Trump’s even harder line, numbers have dwindled further. By April, only about 200 people were staying at Silva’s shelters.

The pastor founded his first shelter on a landfill site in Reynosa almost 30 years ago. Over the years he has heard stories of husbands being murdered, daughters being raped, and extortion payments from criminal gangs in their home regions that were too expensive to pay. “These families need to migrate to protect themselves and their loved ones,” he said.

While he respects the US’s pledge to secure the border, he urges the administration to loosen its policies, especially for the right to request asylum. “Many of these families are good people who deserve an opportunity,” he said.

Across the courtyard, Karina, a Mexican woman from the state of Chiapas mopped the floor in front of her dorm, while her eight-year-old son slurped on a bowl of Fruit Loops cereal. Together, they had crossed the entire country to escape threats of cartel violence and organ trafficking in their community. “Everything was complicated. So we had to flee before anything happened to us,” she said when the Guardian visited in April. Karina had already been at the shelter for eight months waiting for a US appointment, trying the controversial app daily. Such a wait, or longer, was not uncommon, exposing those waiting to the dangers that stalk some parts of the border, particularly from cartel kidnappings for ransom. Waiting was better than nothing, however. But then the US government app stopped working before the authorities got back to her.

According to Gretchen Kuhner, the director of the Institute for Women in Migration (Imumi), a Mexican non-profit that supports migrant women, Karina was far from alone in fleeing violence within Mexico, joining a growing number of people seeking safety elsewhere.

“Lots of people think Mexicans are economic migrants. But they don’t realize the number of people from Mexico who were applying to CBPOne,” Kuhner said. “The Mexican government does not want to talk about” the violence driving migration, she said.

Karina was racked with uncertainty. “We don’t know what will happen. Or if we will be able to cross,” she said when she talked to the Guardian in April.

She saw herself working in a US packaging warehouse or in a shop, making a new life. “If God lets me cross to the United States, I know I will have the ability and intelligence to learn,” she said. The father of her child had been expecting them in Virginia, she said, dejectedly.

Immigration advocates clarify that the drop in migration and empty shelters have been created by US immigration policy, not because the risks and needs in countries of origin are any less dire.

Andrés Ramírez, the former coordinator of Mexico’s Refugee Agency (Comar), said the numbers of migrants entering Mexico from the south had already dropped considerably in 2024 as Panama cracked down on migration through the Darién Gap. From January to April 2025, a mere 73 people had made the treacherous journey across the jungle, down from 82,000 in August 2023.

The 30,000 people whose appointments with US immigration officers were cancelled are now hard to locate. Many are thought to have dispersed across Mexico. Some have been deported by the Mexican government. Others have flocked to cities such as Monterrey or Mexico City in search of work. Many are stuck in desperate conditions in the southern city of Tapachula, bordering Guatemala. And some are applying for asylum in Mexico. But an Imumi report warns against the country being safe for many migrants seeking protection.

Others back at the Senda de Vida shelter have given up on the American dream for now. Wendy, a beautician in her 30s traveling with her son and sister-in-law from Honduras, felt out of options and planned to return home and hope for the best. She would probably turn herself in to Mexican immigration officials who have been bussing migrants down south, she said.

“We have never had much financial stability. My son is in school now. I was hoping to have my own business and my own little house in the US,” she said.

Some cross without authorization after all. “People are hiring smugglers at newly inflated rates”, or taking more dangerous routes, said Kuhner.

Silva, meanwhile, is busy fixing up his shelters. Sooner or later, more migrants will return. “This is not over. Nor will it end. Migration will continue,” he said.

Earlier this month, some who were at the shelter in April had gone back to their countries, some had crossed unlawfully into the US, others had taken off to try their luck in Mexico City.

The Salvadorian family was still in Reynosa. The grandfather may return to El Salvador with his grandson through a program with the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a United Nations body, despite the risk and having sold their house and car to fund the journey north. Some continued to hope and pray for better fortunes.

For those stuck, Silva opened his arms in the modest courtyard with a smile. “Here you won’t want for anything. Even if it is just a tortilla with salt,” he said.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
58,210,"Remove decisions on lone child asylum seekers from Home Office, report says",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/19/remove-decisions-on-lone-child-asylum-seekers-from-home-office-report-says,2025-06-19T13:00:06Z,The Guardian,GB,asylum,"Decisions relating to lone child asylum seekers should be removed from Home Office officials because of fundamental problems with the way they treat this vulnerable group, a report has found.

The report calls for root-and-branch reform of the treatment of thousands of children who have fled persecution in their home countries and made hazardous journeys in search of safety, often crossing the Channel in a dinghy or concealing themselves in the back of a lorry.

Once they arrive in the UK many are wrongly classified as adults by the Home Office and sent to adult accommodation where they may be exploited or locked up in adult immigration detention centres.

Research by the Helen Bamber Foundation in the first half of 2024 in England and Scotland found 53% of young people initially told by the Home Office that they were adults were confirmed to be children by social worker assessments – at least 262 children.

Researchers at the London School of Economics and the University of Bedfordshire, in partnership with the South London Refugee Association, compiled the findings along with young people who have experienced the asylum system.

The report says:

The government should take the asylum decision-making away from the Home Office and give it to independent professionals who know about children and children’s circumstances.

Children and young people need independent legal guardians from the time they arrive in the UK.

Decision-making processes should be faster so that children and young people do not have to spend years waiting to secure their status.

Children should be subject to age disputes only where there is a significant reason to doubt their age and as a measure of last resort where other approaches have been exhausted.

According to the report, one 17-year-old from Eritrea told researchers Home Office officials disputed their age and insisted they were five years older than they said they were.

“I was crying, and I was so depressed, I don’t have any words to explain that, so I said, ‘OK, just leave me alone, please.’ Then they took me back and then they took me for a third interview on the same day.”

The children’s commissioner, Dame Rachel de Souza, said: “Every child, regardless of where they are from or how they arrive in this country, has the right to safety, care and a chance to thrive.

“Children seeking asylum often arrive here alone, traumatised and at risk of exploitation, then face further distress through the uncertainty of confusing systems and long delays.

“Many of the experiences of children set out in this report mirror what children have told me as children’s commissioner and my team who work closely with them, providing advocacy and giving them a voice.

“Every unaccompanied child seeking asylum must be cared for appropriately from the moment they arrive and be treated first and foremost as children by all services that interact with them.”

Kama Petruczenko, a senior policy analyst at the Refugee Council, which provides support for unaccompanied child asylum seekers, said: “Young people who come to Britain in a desperate bid to be safe are invariably frightened and traumatised after all they have endured. They must be treated with dignity and humanity while the government acts as their corporate parent.

“Too often they face delay after delay at the hands of an asylum system beset by chronic backlog. A culture of disbelief around age means young people are often wrongly treated as an adult and deprived the support they need as a child.”

The report, examining the needs of this group of children and young people in London, where around a third of these children across England, are accommodated, was commissioned by London Councils and the Association of London Directors of Children’s Services.

A Home Office spokesperson said: “We thank the London Councils and the Association of London Directors of Children’s Services for this research and will engage with them on the issues.

“The safety and welfare of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children is our utmost priority, and caring for them requires participation from local authorities across the UK.

Asked during a media Q&A about ways to reduce the number of people arriving irregularly, the prime minister said it would have a more “transactional” approach to granting visas for countries depending on their cooperation with returns.

This would also be the case, he said, for countries that did not cooperate on efforts to prevent their nationals heading towards Europe and potentially the UK to claim asylum.

Describing a G7 session on migration at the summit in Kananaskis, Alberta, on Monday, Starmer said: “I made clear that we are looking at issues like a smarter use of our visas, looking at whether we should tie our visas to the work that the countries we’re dealing with are doing on preventive measures and on return agreements.”

The UK currently has returns deals with 11 nations including Albania, India, Pakistan, Vietnam, Iraq, Nigeria and Bangladesh, meaning people refused asylum can be swiftly sent back. This process is seen as a notable disincentive, with the number of Albanian nationals seeking asylum in the UK having dropped sharply.

“We’ve done a number of bilateral returns agreements,” Starmer said. “So the question is, again, whether it’s possible to go a bit beyond that. We are including looking at whether we can’t be a bit smarter with the use of our visas in return in relation to countries that don’t have a returns agreement with us.”

This would be, he added, more “transactional” in approach.

More widely, Starmer said he had spoken with France’s president, Emmanuel Macron, the Italian prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, and Friedrich Merz, the German chancellor, about asylum and small boats.

He said: “I think we need to strengthen our existing tools, but then go further and see what else we can do. And that is a piece of work we’re looking at with the French in particular.”

At the joint session on migration, Starmer said, he also put out proposals on “counter-terrorism, powers and sanctions”.

He added: “I obviously raised it specifically, and indeed in detail, with President Macron, and in terms of the specific actions that I want us to take together, as I did with Giorgia Meloni, slightly more upstream with her, which is where she’s shown some success in reducing her own numbers, and with Friedrich Merz as well, because some of the boats are transiting through Germany.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
60,210,Home Office backs down on asylum refusal for female Afghan activist,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/12/afghan-human-rights-defender-granted-asylum-after-home-office-u-turn,2025-06-12T10:11:54Z,The Guardian,GB,asylum,"An Afghan woman who risked her life defending human rights in her home country has been allowed to stay in the UK after a Home Office U-turn.

The Guardian previously reported on the case of Mina*, whose asylum claim was rejected by the Home Office despite her high-profile work in Afghanistan. She worked for western government-backed projects and was involved in training and mentoring women across the country, which put her in grave danger even before the Taliban took over in 2021.

Home Office officials had said in their refusal letter: “It is considered that you do not face a real risk of persecution or harm on your return to Afghanistan on the basis of your claimed adverse attention by the Taliban.”

Mina’s lawyers lodged an appeal against the refusal but before the appeal was heard the Home Office sent a new letter granting refugee status, saying: “We accept you have a well-founded fear of persecution and therefore cannot return to your country, Afghanistan.”

Mina said she was thrilled about the government’s change of heart. “I had been living in sorrow for a long time,” she said. “But now, good news has finally come, and it has overwhelmed me with joy and happiness. The word ‘freedom’ immediately popped into my head – a freedom to move forward with my life in the UK, a freedom which is taken from millions of Afghan women.”

Her solicitor, Jamie Bell at Duncan Lewis, said: “I am delighted that Mina has finally been granted asylum. She is an astonishingly kind and brave women who never should have had her clear right to asylum doubted for one second.

“It is essential for the home secretary to confirm that all Afghan women are entitled to asylum to ensure that horrendous mistakes like Mina’s case do not happen again.”

The initial refusal of Mina’s claim comes at a time that the asylum grant for Afghanistan has fallen dramatically from a rate of 98.5% in the last quarter of 2023 to 36% in the last quarter of 2024.

According to freedom of information data shared with the Guardian in 2022, 77 appeals against Home Office refusals of Afghan asylum claims were lodged in the immigration court. In 2024 that number jumped to 3,293.

“The fall in the grant rate will not lead to an increase in removal action,” Bell added. “The UK does not acknowledge the Taliban and does not have an agreement to return anyone. The consequence of this startling policy change is that thousands will remain in limbo for years, unable to work whilst their cases are decided by the overburdened court system.”

In a separate case, the Home Office has granted a visa and agreed to fly to the UK a woman who worked to counter violence against women in Afghanistan. She has spent most of her time in hiding since the Taliban takeover of her country.

Mia Lucy Forton, a caseworker at Duncan Lewis, said: “For over three years, our client has lived under the constant threat of detection by the Taliban. Despite the encroachment on the rights of women and girls in Afghanistan, she has remained unwavering in her commitment to advocate for the rights of women in her country.

The Home Office has been approached for comment.

Delivering her spending review, the chancellor also declared an end to the use of asylum hotels this parliament by investing in cutting the backlog and returning more people with no right to be in the UK - which she said would save taxpayers £1bn a year.

Ms Reeves acknowledged that almost 12 months on from Labour's landslide election victory, ""too many people"" are yet to feel their promise of national renewal.

She said the purpose of her spending review is ""to change that"", with departmental budgets to grow by an average of 2.3% a year in real terms until 2028-29.

Key settlements include:

• NHS: The health service gets £29bn for day-to-day spending - a 3% rise for each year until the next general election;

• Housing: £39bn over the next 10 years to build affordable and social housing;

• Defence: Spending will rise from 2.3% of GDP to 2.6% by 2027, made up of an £11bn uplift on defence and £600m for security and intelligence agencies;

• Science and tech: Research and development funding will hit £22bn, with AI plans getting £2bn;

• Transport: £15bn for new rail, tram, and bus networks in the North and the West Midlands, a new rail line between Liverpool and Manchester, and a four-year settlement for TfL, plus the £3 bus fare cap extended to 2027;

• Nations: Scotland gets £52bn, Northern Ireland £20bn, and Wales £23bn, including for coal tips;

• Education: Free school meals extended to 500,000 children, while the extra £4.5bn per year will also go on fixing classrooms and rebuilding schools;

• Nuclear: A £30bn commitment to nuclear power, including £14.2bn to build Sizewell C plant in Suffolk and £2.5bn in small modular reactors;

• Prisons: 14,000 new prison places will be funded with a £7bn injection;

• Police: 13,000 more police officers will be paid for with £2bn.

Read more: The key announcements

Many of Wednesday's announcements have been front-loaded by cash injections made since Labour took office, meaning that from 2025-26 the increase is a more modest 1.5% on average.

Over the course of the whole parliament, it equates to spending £190bn more on the day-to-day running of public services and £113bn more on capital investments than under the previous government's spending plans, the chancellor said.

Ms Reeves drew a distinction between her review and the Tories' austerity agenda in 2010, saying they cut spending by 2.9%.

She said austerity was a ""destructive choice for the fabric of our society"" and ""different choices"" would be made under Labour.

However, while overall departmental spending will increase day to day, some departments face a squeeze.

Home Office budget squeezed

This includes the Home Office, whose spend will reduce by 1.4% over the next three years, including daily spend and capital investments.

Daily spend covers the daily running costs of public services, while capital investment is spending by the state on the creation of fixed, long-term assets, such as roads and railways.

Combined, the Foreign Office and Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) also face reductions, as does the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport, and the Cabinet Office.

Paul Johnson, the director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said 3% a year increases in NHS spending ""does mean virtually nothing on average for current spending elsewhere"".

Ms Reeves said the cash boost for the NHS would fund more appointments, more doctors and more scanners.

She used this to draw dividing lines with Reform UK, saying they have called for an '""insurance-based system"" whereas Labour created the NHS, protected the NHS and under this government would ""renew the NHS"".

Speculation of tax rises

Ms Reeves said she was able to raise the money through decisions made in her autumn budget and spring statement, which saw taxes raised by £40bn and cuts made to the welfare budget.

However, the Tories said the review ""isn't worth the paper it's written on"" and further tax hikes will be needed.

Shadow chancellor Sir Mel Stride said that ""this is the spend-now, tax-later review"", adding Ms Reeves ""knows she will need to come back here in the autumn with yet more taxes and a cruel summer of speculation awaits"".

The Liberal Democrats said the ""smoke and mirrors"" spending review would leave a black hole in social care as local government budgets remain at breaking point.

""Putting more money into the NHS without fixing social care is like pouring water into a leaky bucket,"" said the party's Treasury spokesperson Daisy Cooper.",GNews,-0.78,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/sky-news-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.79,"sky news, SkyNews, Sky News UK, sky.com/news, sky.com",,https://ground.news/interest/sky-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/sky-news-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,,,,Center,High,Center,Unknown,Left,Lean Left,Center,news.sky.com,,sky news,31,UK,Y,E,Sky News,

In a speech to the Commons setting out Labour’s priorities up to the next general election, the chancellor said her investment programme would be felt in all corners of the country, while decrying austerity as a “destructive choice”.

Announcing the government’s spending review, the chancellor made a high-stakes promise to cut spending on controversial issues such as asylum hotels by the end of the parliament, which she said would save £1bn.

1:56 From defence to social housing: Rachel Reeves's spending review in two minutes – video

But the Home Office will receive a budget cut which will extend beyond the asylum savings, causing alarm from police officers and the London mayor Sadiq Khan. Others that will see spending cuts include Defra and local government, as well as the Foreign Office which will see an almost 7% cut because of the loss of much of the foreign aid budget.

“We are renewing Britain,” Reeves said. “I know that too many people in too many parts of our country are yet to feel it. This government’s task, my task as chancellor, and the purpose of this spending review is to change that, to ensure that renewal is felt in people’s everyday lives, in their jobs and on their high streets.

“The priorities of this spending review are the priorities of working people, to invest in Britain’s security, in Britain’s health, and to grow Britain’s economy so that working people are better off.”

Reeves said total departmental budgets would grow by 2.3% a year in real terms, drawing a comparison with the 2.9% cut under the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition – a retort to her critics who have accused her of a return to austerity.

“Austerity was a destructive choice for the fabric of our society, and it was a destructive choice for our economy too, choking off investment and demand,” Reeves said. “Creating a lost decade for growth, wages and living standards that is their legacy. My choices are different. My choices are Labour choices.”

She said there would be “tough decisions for stability”, a nod to the unpopularity of the now partly reversed winter fuel allowance and welfare cuts, as well as tax rises including the increase in the national insurance rate paid by employers.

However, experts warned the chancellor could face a summer of speculation over possible further tax increases at the autumn budget, after Reeves reiterated a promise to stick to her “ironclad” fiscal rules – despite concerns over rising government borrowing costs and a sluggish growth outlook.

“It looks increasingly likely that substantial tax increases will be needed in the autumn budget,” said Andrew Goodwin, chief UK economist at the consultancy Oxford Economics.

“Considering the plans require large efficiency savings, departments may find it hard to stick to the targets… today’s spending review leaves the impression of being a stopgap, rather than a durable plan.”

In a highly political speech, Reeves attacked the Tories and Reform for opposing her changes to the fiscal rules and tax rises announced at last year’s October budget, saying the investment would never have been possible under them.

“Every one of those changes was opposed by the parties opposite. So today, they can make an honest choice, and they can oppose these spending plans as they oppose every penny I raise to fund them, or they can make the same choice as Liz Truss, spend more, borrow more, with no regard for the consequences.”

The Conservative shadow chancellor said the spending rise was “not worth the paper that it is written on” and would mean months of speculation over how it would be paid for. “This is the spend now, tax later review, because [she] knows she will need to come back here in the autumn with yet more taxes, and a cruel summer of speculation awaits.”

The health service was the biggest winner in terms of day-to-day spending, increasing in real terms by 3% a year – though lower than some years under the Conservatives. It will mean the health service gets £29bn extra a year.

Defence is among those with the biggest spending boost – as expected – with spending rising to 2.6% of GDP by April 2027, though that includes the intelligence agencies. It will mean £11bn for defence and £600m extra for security services.

Another key winner was Angela Rayner’s housing department, where Reeves said “social housing [had been] neglected for too many decades, but not by this Labour government”. Overnight, she had announced £39bn over the next decade. Blackpool, Preston, Sheffield and Swindon are among the towns that have already put forward bids for the cash.

The department most unhappy with its settlement is the Home Office, especially the policing budget, which chiefs have warned will mean the government will miss its manifesto commitments on recruitment and tackling crime.

Reeves said the department would get an average 2.3% increase a year in real terms over the spending review period, an increase of £2bn, but the funding is far below what police services believe will be adequate.

The chancellor also vowed there would be significant savings on asylum, with an ambitious pledge to end spending on hotels for asylum seekers by the end of the parliament, without saying how.

Reeves said there would be new funding for the department to hear cases and appeals more quickly and deport those whose claims were rejected, saying the end of the use of hotels would save taxpayers £1bn.

Education will get a cash uplift of £4.5bn in the core schools budget, as well as £2.3bn in investment to fix school classrooms, especially those with crumbling concrete. From the capital budget, there will be £2.4bn a year to continue the rebuilding of 500 schools.

Several departments have secured better-than-expected investments, including those of the environment secretary, Steve Reed, and the energy secretary, Ed Miliband. Defra will get a major funding boost for flood defences, investing £4.2bn over three years, though overall spending will be cut by 2.7%,

The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero has the biggest increase in capital spending at five times the average departmental growth rate. The spending review will fund manifesto commitments for £13.2bn on home insulation and the full £8.3bn for Great British Energy, which many reports had speculated would be cut.

Other major funding programmes include an already announced £14.2bn for a new nuclear power station, Sizewell C, and £2.5bn investment to develop small modular reactors. There is an additional £9.4bn for carbon capture, including Acorn in Scotland.

Major transport projects were also given additional funding, including the east-west rail link between Oxford and Cambridge, which will receive an extra £2.5bn and a further £3.5bn investment in the Transpennine route upgrade as well as the Midlands Rail Hub, the region’s biggest rail improvement scheme. There will be £445m for railways in Wales over 10 years.

Reeves said she understood that the decline of high streets was a key driver of dissatisfaction in Britain, saying there too many regeneration projects had been “held back, gathering dust in bureaucratic limbo”. There would be a new growth mission fund to expedite local projects, she announced.

The additional funding will support up to 350 communities to improve parks, youth facilities, swimming pools and libraries and to tackle graffiti and fly tipping.

Reeves also used the spending review to announce government investment in R&D and entrepreneurs, confirming R&D spending would reach £22bn a year by the end of the spending review. She will increase the investment power of the British Business Bank to £25.6bn, which she said would be directed towards helping British business scale up.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

Rachel Reeves said “we are renewing Britain” as she set out how she plans to spend hundreds of billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money. The Chancellor said total departmental budgets would grow by 2.3% a year in real terms and promised a “record cash investment” in the NHS, amounting to an extra £29 billion a year.

Setting out the spending review in the House of Commons, Ms Reeves said the tax hikes and looser borrowing rules allowed her to spend £190 billion more on the day-to-day running of public services and £113 billion on investment.

Ms Reeves promised funding of up to £280 million more per year by the end of the spending review period in 2028/29 for the new Border Security Command and committed to end spending on hotels for asylum seekers by the next election.

The Chancellor said her “driving purpose” was “to make working people, in all parts of our country, better off” as she promised cash to rebuild schools and hospitals, confirmed funding for nuclear power schemes and major transport projects across the country. “We are renewing Britain,” she said. “But I know that too many people in too many parts of our country are yet to feel it.”

As well as changing Treasury rules to support investment in England’s regions, Ms Reeves said the spending review period would provide £52 billion for Scotland, £20 billion for Northern Ireland and £23 billion for Wales.

Border Security and asylum seekers

At least £280 million a year will be invested into border security by 2028-29, including into the Border Security Command, to tackle people-smuggling gangs running small boats. Funding of at least £400 million a year by 2028-29 will speed up the process of asylum processing, increase appeals capacity and continue asylum returns alongside ending the costly use of hotels for accommodation.

More money for the NHS

The Government is increasing real-terms day to day spending in the NHS by 3% per year for every year of the review period, Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced, providing an extra “£29 billion per year” for the health service. Ms Reevessaid the Government was spending £10 billion on digitising services as part of the Government’s 10-year plan for the health service.

She said: “To support that plan, to back the doctors and nurses we rely on, and to make sure the NHS is there whenever we need it, I am proud to announce today that this Labour Government is making a record cash investment in our NHS, increasing real-terms, day-to-day spending by 3% per year for every year of this spending review.

“An extra £29 billion per year for the day-to-day running of the health service. That is what the British people voted for and that is what we will deliver. More appointments. More doctors. More scanners.

“The National Health Service, created by a Labour government, protected, by a Labour government, and renewed, by this Labour Government.”

More money for police

Police spending power will see an average 2.3% real terms increase over the Spending Review period as the government puts police back on the beat in communities across England and Wales. The Government has promised an additional 13,000 police officers, PCSOs and special constables in neighbourhood roles.

Transport

The Chancellor announced £15.6 billion funding in total by 2031-32 for local transport projects in England’s city regions and £2.3 billion from 2026-27 to 2029-30 for local transport improvements outside of these nine regions. The Chancellor announced a further £2.5 billion to connect Oxford and Cambridge through the continued delivery of East-West Rail and confirmed she will set out plans to take forward work on Northern Powerhouse Rail in the coming weeks.

Funding announced today will deliver upgrades to Cardiff Central station, reduce journey times between Manchester and Leeds through continued investment in the TransPennine Route Upgrade, and progress the delivery of Midlands Rail Hub, enhancing connections from Birmingham across the West Midlands and to other regions.

Money for communities

The Chancellor also confirmed additional funding for up to 350 communities, especially those in deprived areas, through Plans for Neighbourhoods – giving new long-term regeneration funding and supporting councils in their fightback against graffiti and fly-tipping across Britain.

The money could be used for more parks, community centres and libraries.

Devolved nations

The Scottish Government will receive an average extra £2.9 billion across the duration of this Spending Review through the operation of the Barnett formula. In recognition of Scotland’s unique needs, they will have 20% more to spend per individual than comparable UK Government spending for people in the rest of the UK.

The Welsh Government will benefit from an average extra £1.6 billion over the Spending Review period through the Barnett formula to deliver against the priorities of working people in Wales, and 20% more to spend per individual than comparable UK Government does for people in the rest of the UK.

The Northern Ireland Executive will receive an average extra £1.2 billion through the Barnett formula, 24% more to spend per person than the comparable UK Government spending in the rest of the UK, reflecting Northern Ireland’s unique circumstances.

More money for schools, school buildings and nurseries

Rachel Reeves has said £370 million will be spent on school-based nurseries, in addition to £555 million to “break the dangerous cycle of late intervention and low-quality care”.

The Chancellor told the Commons: “I can also announce £370 million for school-based nurseries, to put us firmly on track to meet our Plan for Change commitment – for a record number of children being school-ready.

“And for children’s social care, to break the dangerous cycle of late intervention and low-quality care, I am providing £555 million of transformation funding over the spending review period, so that children do not go needlessly into care when they could stay at home. And, for children where state intervention is necessary, better care and better outcomes.

“And last week, I was pleased to announce, with … the Culture Secretary (Lisa Nandy) that more than £130 million from the Dormant Assets scheme with the financial services sector will be allocated to fund facilities for our young people, to give every child the chance to take part in music, sport and drama, to fund libraries in schools, so that the confidence and opportunities that those resources open up, are no longer the preserve of a privileged few.”",GNews,,,not found,,,,"plymouth live, Plymouth Herald, plymouthherald.co.uk",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/plymouthlive-bias-and-credibility/,https://ground.news/interest/plymouth-herald,not found,LEAST BIASED (1.5),HIGH (1.0),United Kingdom,0,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,High,Center,Center,Unknown,Unknown,Center,plymouthherald.co.uk,,plymouth live,99,United Kingdom,,,,

Albanian national Jetnor Dani, 32, has been jailed

General view of Dunkley Street, Wolverhampton

An illegal immigrant caught manning a secret £21,000 cannabis farm has been locked up.

Albanian national Jetnor Dani was asleep inside a terraced house in Wolverhampton when police stormed the hidden drugs den.

‌



Cannabis plants were uncovered in the loft, with Dani tasked with 'maintaining' the 'substantial operation'.

‌



The convict has now been jailed for his part in the running of the drugs factory - but it is understood he has applied for asylum in the UK and is waiting the outcome of his application.

Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how police received a called from a man referring to himself as 'John' in March 2025.

He claimed there was 'drugs money' at a property which he had 'run away from' a few hours earlier.

John said he had been taken to a property in Dunkley Street 'by people who were trafficking females and children', prosecutor Harinderpal Dhami said.

The caller told police he refused to work at the cannabis den but was 'scared for his family'.

‌



John also claimed that two people connected to the set-up were at a property on Newhampton Road East.

Officers then went to Dunkley Street where they found Dani asleep on a bed in a ground-floor room.

The house was 'well maintained' and 'clean', with keys in the front of rear doors.

‌



There were 'family pictures and decorations' in the room where Dani was found, Mr Dhami said.

'Cannabis growing paraphernalia' were seized from two rooms at the back of the house, while the electricity had been bypassed.

Officers also found notebooks which appeared to be 'expenditure lists' for the drugs operation.

‌



A 'cannabis set-up', with a total of 25 mature plants, was discovered in the loft.

The drugs had a potential street value of between £7,000 and £21,000 or between £3,500 and £5,000 if sold in bulk.

Dani told police he had been living at the property for one to two months.

‌



The court heard how the defendant had previous convictions for shoplifting and obstruction of a police officer dating back to 2023.

David Martin-Sperry, defending, said Dani had made an 'asylum claim'.

But Mr Martin-Sperry said he had been given 'limited' information by the defendant, adding: ""I have no instruction on how he came to be doing what he was doing.""

‌



He added: ""It looks as though he was not involved at a pretty high level at all.

""It's apparent that he had instructions that he was not to go into any other parts of the building.""

Sentencing, Judge Michael Chambers KC said Dani came to the UK illegally and so had 'no right to work or prospect of employment'.

‌



He said: ""You played a significant role. You must have had some awareness and understanding of the scale of the operation.

""This was a substantial operation. You gained by being provided with accommodation. You clearly had an operational function.""

66,37,Federal judge orders the Trump administration to return a Guatemalan man deported to Mexico to the U.S.,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/federal-judge-trump-administration-guatemalan-deported-mexico-return/,2025-05-24T19:14:24Z,CBS News,US,asylum,"A federal judge ordered the Trump administration late Friday to facilitate the return of a Guatemalan man it deported to Mexico in spite of his fears of being harmed there.

The man, who is gay, was protected from being returned to his home country under a U.S. immigration judge's order at the time. But the U.S. put him on a bus and sent him to Mexico instead, a removal that U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy found likely ""lacked any semblance of due process.""

Mexico has since returned him to Guatemala, where he is in hiding, according to court documents. An earlier court proceeding determined that the man, identified by the initials O.C.G., risked persecution or torture if returned to Guatemala, but he also feared returning to Mexico. He presented evidence of being raped and held for ransom there while seeking asylum in the U.S.

Court documents stated the Guatemalan man said he was only told about his deportation to Mexico, essentially as it was happening and that he begged to speak to his attorney but was denied.

""No one has ever suggested that O.C.G. poses any sort of security threat,"" Murphy wrote. ""In general, this case presents no special facts or legal circumstances, only the banal horror of a man being wrongfully loaded onto a bus and sent back to a country where he was allegedly just raped and kidnapped.""

O.C.G. entered the U.S. in March 2024, without prior authorization, according to court documents. The man said he had asked for asylum, was denied an interview and was deported shortly thereafter to Guatemala. In April 2024, O.C.G. decided to try again and crossed Mexico where, he said, he was raped and held hostage until a family member paid ransom.

In May 2024, he arrived in the U.S. and was referred to an asylum officer after expressing fear of return to Guatemala. The officer determined he had had a credible fear of persecution or torture and initiated withholding-only proceedings. Two days later, he was sent to Mexico, court documents show.

A message seeking comment was left with the Department of Homeland Security.

Murphy's order adds to a string of findings by federal courts against recent Trump administration deportations. Those have included other deportations to third countries and the erroneous deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an El Salvadoran who had lived in Maryland for roughly 14 years working and raising a family.

The U.S. Supreme Court ordered the Trump administration to facilitate Abrego Garcia's return to the U.S. from a notorious Salvadoran prison, rejecting the White House's claim that it couldn't retrieve him after mistakenly deporting him. Both the White House and the El Salvadoran president have said they are powerless to return him. The Trump administration has tried to invoke the state secrets privilege, arguing that releasing details in open court - or even to the judge in private – about returning Abrego Garcia to the United States would jeopardize national security.

In his Friday ruling, Murphy nodded to the dispute over the verb ""facilitate"" in that case and others, saying that returning O.C.G. to the U.S. is not that complicated.

""The Court notes that 'facilitate' in this context should carry less baggage than in several other notable cases,"" he wrote. ""O.C.G. is not held by any foreign government. Defendants have declined to make any argument that facilitating his return would be costly, burdensome, or otherwise impede the government's objectives.""",GNews,-3.03,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.88,"cbs news, CBS, CBS News, cbsnews.com, cbsnews",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/,https://ground.news/interest/cbs-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,CBS Corporation,1927,-1.5,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,cbsnews.com,,cbs news,21,USA,Y,G,CBS News,

A 21-year-old tourist has claimed he was denied entry to the United States and faced scrutiny from border agents due to a JD Vance meme found on his phone.

Mads Mikkelsen was pulled aside by border security after he had just flown into New Jersey's Newark Airport on June 11. The traveller said he was placed in a cell and eventually questioned by staff.

‌



The Norwegian man said he had originally gone to the US with plans of visiting his friends in various states, including in New York and then Texas.

‌

However, the young man said he allegedly faced ""harassment and abuse of power"" from authorities at the airport.

He told Norwegian outlet Nordlys: ""I felt prejudiced, suspected and simply humiliated even then, in front of many other people at the airport.

""They took me to a room with several armed guards, where I had to hand over my shoes, mobile phone and backpack.""

The 21-year-old claimed the officers began asking him about what he had organised for his trip to the US, before adopting a direct line of questioning about three shocking topics.

He alleged: ""They asked direct questions about drug smuggling, terrorist plans and right-wing extremism, completely without reason.

‌



""They demanded full information about everyone I was going to meet in the US, including name, address, phone number and what they did for work."" Mads' mother was due to meet up with him a few weeks into his stay and the pair had planned to travel to several national parks.

""I had travelled for twelve hours, slept poorly, and was physically and mentally completely exhausted even before they started the questioning,"" Dublin Live reported.

A 21-year-old tourist has outlined the reception he allegedly faced at US border control after a 'bald' JD Vance meme was found on his phone

‌



A strenuous crackdown by U.S. Customs and Border Protection has followed President Donald Trump's return to office, with the service being allowed to search phones.

A French scientist was denied entry at the border earlier this year, in March, after officers unearthed messages criticising Trump on his phone. Mikkelsen explained: ""They threatened me with a minimum fine of $5,000 or five years in prison if I refused to provide the password to my phone.""

After handing over his password, Mads was told he would not be allowed to go through with his planned vacation after two images were not to the officers' liking.

‌



One image was of a meme showcasing JD Vance with a bald, egg-shaped head. Variations of the image were shared endlessly in March on social media, with the Vice President himself posting his own version.

The other picture showed Mads with a wooden pipe which he had made years prior. ""Both pictures had been automatically saved to my camera roll from a chat app, but I really didn't think that these innocent pictures would put a stop to my entry into the country,"" the 21-year-old admitted.

Mads told Nordlys he tried to explain the images as being harmless and meant as jokes but the immigration authorities ignored his pleas. He claims he was then strip-searched, forced to give blood samples, a facial scan and fingerprints.

‌



""Later I was taken back in, and the situation got even worse. I was pushed up against a wall and was strip-searched with a lot of force. They were incredibly harsh and used physical force the whole time,"" he claimed.

""I felt completely devastated and broke down, and was close to crying several times. I was on the verge of panic. It felt like I was a terrorist suspect where I was sitting. I tried to pull myself together several times, but in the end, I just wanted to get home again.""

‌



The Norwegian added he was placed in a cell for a further five hours, refused food or water and placed on a plane back to Oslo the same day he arrived for the holiday of a lifetime.

He said: ""I don't feel there is any point in contacting the State Department, nor do I think they have any power against such a powerful and strict country as the United States.""

Mathias Rongved, a spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has warned fellow Norwegians that it is their duty to be clued up on US regulations before entering the country. ""Most trips to the US go without any particular problems,"" he said.

""Entry regulations can change at short notice, and it is the traveller's responsibility to have valid documents and be familiar with the current entry regulations. It is the immigration authorities upon arrival who decide whether you are rejected at the border. Norwegian authorities cannot intervene in this decision.

68,143,Pregnant Cuban immigrant worries about baby's citizenship as Supreme Court weighs Trump order,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/pregnant-cuban-immigrant-birthright-citizenship-trump-worries-rcna206708,2025-05-14T13:37:36Z,NBC News,US,asylum,"Barbara, a Cuban emigre 30 weeks into a high-risk pregnancy, is dealing with the additional stress of not knowing for sure that her baby girl will be an American citizen.

“It scares me a lot that my baby will be born without citizenship because she would not be a citizen of this country. Claiming Cuban citizenship is not an option because we are fleeing from that country,” she said. “I really don’t know what kind of future my baby would face. I am terrified that my baby will be born without citizenship. It would be like she would be stateless. It’s terrible.”

The 35-year-old woman lives in Kentucky, which is not among the 22 states that sued to challenge President Donald Trump’s executive order that would deny citizenship to children who are born on U.S. soil to parents who are in the country illegally or temporarily.

Lower courts have so far blocked the executive order from taking effect anywhere in the United States. In arguments Thursday, the Supreme Court weighs the Trump administration’s request to narrow those court orders so that they cover only the parties that sued in federal court. Affected children born in Kentucky would not be citizens, if the court sides with the administration.

The woman agreed to an interview with The Associated Press on condition that her last name not be used and her face not be shown on camera.

Barbara has joined the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, one of the groups that sued over birthright citizenship. Members of the group likely would be protected under court orders.

She was a lawyer in Cuba before fleeing religious persecution in 2022 with her husband, a daughter, now 4, and her parents, Barbara said. They are seeking political asylum in the United States.

“I would not want my daughter to grow up in a society that excludes her. As a citizen, she will have a lot of rights. I don’t know exactly how many places she would not be able to access if she were not a citizen,” Barbara said.

A possible outcome of the court case is babies born to immigrant mothers at the same time in the same American hospital would have different status. One might be a U.S. citizen; the other might not.

Birthright citizenship is among several issues the administration has asked the court to deal with on an emergency basis, after lower courts acted to slow Trump’s agenda. Several of those relate to immigration. The justices are considering the administration’s pleas to end humanitarian parole for more than 500,000 people from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela and strip other temporary legal protections from another 350,000 Venezuelans.

The administration also remains locked in legal battles over its efforts to swiftly deport people accused of being gang members to a prison in El Salvador under an 18th century wartime law called the Alien Enemies Act.

If the court agrees to limit the ability of judges to issue nationwide, or universal, injunctions, the restrictions would be allowed to take effect for now in at least 27 states.

The current fight is over what rules will apply while the lawsuits proceed through the courts. But even though the high court is not expected to issue a final decision about birthright citizenship, a ruling for the administration could lead to a confusing, if temporary, patchwork of rules that might differ based on what state children are born in or whether they are members of immigrants rights groups that sued.

Birthright citizenship automatically makes anyone born in the United States an American citizen, including children born to mothers in the country illegally, under long-standing rules. The right was enshrined soon after the Civil War in the first sentence of the Constitution’s 14th Amendment.

“All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside,” the Citizenship Clause reads.

Since at least 1898 and the Supreme Court case of Wong Kim Ark, the provision has been widely interpreted to make citizens of everyone born on U.S. soil except for the children of diplomats, who have allegiance to another government; enemies present in the U.S. during hostile occupation; and, until a federal law changed things in 1924, sovereign Native American tribes.

Trump and his supporters have argued that there should be tougher standards for becoming an American citizen, which he called “a priceless and profound gift” in the executive order. Trump’s order would deny citizenship to children if neither parent is a citizen or lawful permanent resident. Those categories include people who are in the country illegally or temporarily because, the administration contends, they are not “subject to the jurisdiction” of the United States.

In the Supreme Court case, the administration spends little time defending Trump’s executive order, focusing instead on what it calls “an epidemic” of nationwide, or universal, injunctions.

“The need for this Court’s intervention has become urgent as universal injunctions have reached tsunami levels,” Solicitor General D. John Sauer wrote in a court filing. Judges have issued 39 such orders against the administration so far, the Justice Department said.

At least two justices, Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch, have said they believe individual judges lack the power to issue nationwide injunctions. Several others have suggested the injunctions raise questions the court might someday answer.

But New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin, leading one of the lawsuits, said this is not the right case to deal with the issue because Trump is offering a “warped reading” of the 14th Amendment that is at odds with Supreme Court precedent. “I do think this is a very imperfect vehicle to have to raise the question about nationwide injunctions ... because it’s very clear that the 14th Amendment applies uniformly across states if you’re born here,” Platkin said.",GNews,-5.61,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,42.76,"nbc news, NBC, nbcnews.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Comcast,1940,-1.8,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,nbcnews.com,,nbc news,24,USA,,,,

Huw Irranca-Davies said the facility at Parc Cybi near the port of Holyhead in Anglesey was commissioned last year to follow the post-Brexit requirements of border controls on imports, including live animals and goods such as food, from the EU.

The facility received £44m in funding from the UK government, and the border control post (BCP) is now nearing completion. It is set to be handed over to the Welsh government in the autumn.

But the post will sit empty for now following an announcement by the UK government that it was set to negotiate with the EU to exempt many imports of live animals and goods from sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) checks at the border, according to Mr Irranca-Davies.

He said the Welsh government was committed to ""ensuring an acceptable level of biosecurity protection over the interim period whilst the agreement is negotiated and implemented"".

Although physical and identity checks on imports from the EU began in April 2024, Mr Irranca-Davies highlighted that no start date for SPS checks on imports from Ireland has been announced.

""I have decided not to proceed with the final commissioning and staffing of the Holyhead BCP, and not to take forward construction of BCPs at Fishguard and Pembroke Dock,"" Wales's deputy first minister said in a statement.

Mr Irranca-Davies added that he will ""keep that decision under review until the final details of the agreement with the EU are known"", at which point longer-term plans for the site would be made.

""In the meantime, it is crucial that it remains ready and available as a potential BCP facility,"" he said.

The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) has released an updated warning for British citizens intending to travel to Turkey. The advice focuses on those entering the country from Iran, given the heightened tensions with the US and Israel.

In its alert issued on Friday, the FCDO states: ""If you are a British national wanting to cross the land border from Iran into Turkey, you will need to request facilitation from the British Embassy in Ankara by contacting the FCDO before travelling to the border, indicating whether you are contacting from Iran or from the UK on behalf of a relative.

""You will need to provide personal details (name, date of birth, details of travel document used to enter Turkey). This is required by the Turkish authorities.

""The usual entry requirements will apply, including that British nationals can enter without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. If you intend to leave Iran overland, you do so at your own risk.

""In Iran, holding a British passport or having perceived connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you,"" reports the Express.

This travel alert is a response to the ongoing tensions between Iran and Israel. This comes in the wake of US President Donald Trump's announcement of a 'total' ceasefire deal between the two nations.

British nationals are being urged to exercise caution and heed the government's guidance. Travelling against FCDO advice could mean Brits find their travel insurance void and assistance from the British embassy limited, especially if journeying to locations officially discouraged.

The FCDO also warns against all travel within 10km of Turkey's border with Syria due to ongoing conflict and an increased threat of terrorism. It states: ""Fighting in Syria continues in areas close to the Turkish border and there is a heightened risk of terrorism in the region.

""Due to the ongoing conflict in Syria, roads in Hatay Province leading towards the border may be closed at short notice.""",GNews,,,not found,,,,"coventry telegraph, Coventry Telegraph, coventrytelegraph.net, coventry live, coventrylive",not found,,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,coventrytelegraph.net,,coventry telegraph,248,UK,,,,

All vehicles and travellers, both Thai and foreigners, will be prohibited from crossing borders into Cambodia across seven provinces, according to statements by Thailand’s army and navy.

Tensions between Cambodia and Thailand have soared since May when troops briefly exchanged fire at a contested area of the border, killing a Cambodian soldier. The incident has led to tit-for-tat actions by both governments, and rising nationalism either side of the border.

Thailand’s prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who is facing a political crisis over the handling of the dispute, said on Monday that screening at land borders would be increased, and exemptions would be made only in some cases such as patients requiring medical treatment, or students travelling for education.

The latest border closures follow a series of retaliatory measures imposed by both governments. Over recent weeks, Cambodia has banned Thai films from TV and cinemas, cut internet bandwidth from Thailand, and suspended fruit, vegetables imports from Thailand, as well as gas and fuel imports. Thailand also increased its border restrictions, while both sides shortened visa status for visitors from either country.

Paetongtarn is facing calls to resign over her handling of the dispute, and has been accused of failing to take a tough stance against the former Cambodian leader Hun Sen – who is known to be an old friend of her father, the populist former leader Thaksin Shinawatra.

Last week, a phone call between her and Hun Sen, who remains powerful in Cambodia, was leaked, prompting public outrage. In the recording, she could be heard criticising a senior Thai military commander who she said “just wanted to look tough”, and telling Hun Sen, who she addresses as “uncle”, that if there were anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”.

The call infuriated her family’s longstanding enemies in the military, and was cited by one of her government’s coalition partners as a reason for its departure from government. Paetongtarn later apologised for her comments, saying they were a negotiating tactic and calling for unity within Thailand.



On Monday, Paetongtarn said that Thailand would consider blocking exports to Cambodia that could be used by criminal gangs running scam operations in the country, and that Thailand would work with others in the region and international agencies to crack down on such cybercrime.



Cambodia has been pointed to by both UN experts and human rights groups as a global hotspot for illegal scam activities, where victims of human trafficking are held against their will and forced into criminality.

The military identified the remains as those of Yonatan Samerano, 21; Ofra Keidar, 70; and Shay Levinson, 19.

All three were killed when Hamas militants stormed across the border into Israel on 7 October 2023, an act which ignited the ongoing war.

The militant group still holds 50 hostages, of whom only 20 are believed to be alive.

""The campaign to return the hostages continues consistently and is happening alongside the campaign against Iran,"" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said.

Israel's military did not provide any details about the recovery operation.

Mr Samerano's father Kobi said in a Facebook post that his son's remains were returned on what would have been his 23rd birthday.

The Hostages Families Forum, which is the main organisation representing the families of the hostages, has repeatedly called for a deal to release the remaining captives.

""Particularly against the backdrop of current military developments and the significant achievements in Iran, we want to emphasise that bringing back the remaining 50 hostages is the key to achieving any sort of victory,"" it said.

Hamas has said it will only release the remaining hostages in return for more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting ceasefire and an Israeli withdrawal from Gaza.

Mr Netayahu has rejected the group's terms, saying Israel will continue the war until all hostages are returned and Hamas is defeated or disarmed.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducted 251 people during the 7 October 2023 attack.

Thousands of plush toys urgently recalled with UK households warned

Thousands of plush toys sold in the UK are being urgently recalled. The toys are being removed from sale and taken off sale after they were REJECTED at the border amid fears of a ""serious"" health risk.

The affected items include plush toys and children’s play kits, with some products even being rejected at the border. Among the most alarming cases is the Locisne Hamster Plush Toy, which has been pulled from store shelves and online marketplaces, including Amazon.

‌



Labour Party government safety officials warned that the toy's plastic eyes can detach and pose a choking hazard to young children. ""This product presents a serious risk of choking as the eyes of the hamster can detach and fit wholly in a small parts cylinder,"" the report stated.

‌

Officials emphasized that the toy fails to meet safety requirements under the Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011. Other items recalled include Girls Creator Nail Art Studio Kit, which includes nail varnish, a battery-operated nail dryer, and accessories. Authorities flagged it for suffocation risks due to potential issues with packaging or small parts.

Another recall has hit Joycat Baby Float, a sea-themed swimming seat for infants, was rejected at the UK border. Safety inspectors found that the float’s attachable canopy could catch wind and lift the entire device from the water, endangering children.

The government said: ""This product presents a serious risk of choking as the eyes of the hamster can detach and fit wholly in a small parts cylinder. If a child under 3 were to use and mouth the toy, the small parts may become detached and cause the child to choke.

""The product does not meet the requirements of the Toys (Safety) Regulations 2011."" The import has been rejected at the border.

The FCDO has issued a travel update to UK tourists heading to one major holiday hotspot.

Travellers heading to Turkey this year have been waned over border crossing requirements between Iran and Turkey.

‌



The update on June 20 read: ""If you are a British national wanting to cross the land border from Iran into Turkey, you will need to request facilitation from the British Embassy in Ankara by contacting the FCDO before travelling to the border, indicating whether you are contacting from Iran or from the UK on behalf of a relative.

‌



""You will need to provide personal details (name, date of birth, details of travel document used to enter Turkey). This is required by the Turkish authorities.

""The usual entry requirements will apply, including that British nationals can enter without a visa for up to 90 days in any 180-day period.

""If you intend to leave Iran overland, you do so at your own risk. In Iran, holding a British passport or having perceived connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you.""

The government website also adds elsewhere that: ""if you are affected by a crisis abroad [you should] call the FCDO on (+44) (0)207 008 5000,"" the Express reported.

The Foreign Office page for those who are looking to visit Iran from Britain strictly states the body ""advises against all travel to Iran.""

‌



Guidelines written on the website explain: ""FCDO advises against all travel to Iran. If you are a British national already in Iran, either resident or visitor, carefully consider your presence there and the risks you take by staying.

""British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention.

""Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you.""

‌



There is a detailed explanation of the decision from the FCDO to advise against all travel, with the body referencing the ""political situation"" in the country.

It states: ""Israel continues to operate militarily against Iran. Reports suggest that a wide range of military, nuclear and civil installations across the country have been hit.

""Major cities have been affected, and the Israeli Defence Forces have issued evacuation warnings for some residential districts. A significant Iranian military response is ongoing.

‌



""Due to the ongoing security situation, we have taken the precautionary measure to temporarily withdraw UK staff from Iran. Our embassy continues to operate remotely.

If you are already in the country, the FCDO adds having a British passport or connections to the UK could be enough for authorities in Iran to detain you.

The page explains: ""Air, sea and land routes are under the control of the Iranian authorities. You should not assume that ports and borders will remain open.

""There is a very high risk of arrest, questioning and detention for British nationals and British-Iranian dual nationals.

78,210,Thai PM apologises over leaked call with Hun Sen as crisis threatens to topple government,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jun/20/thai-prime-minister-paetongtarn-shinawatra-apologises-phone-leak-crisis-cambodia-hun-sen,2025-06-19T23:46:03Z,The Guardian,GB,border,"Thailand’s prime minister, Paetongtarn Shinawatra, apologised after a leaked phone conversation with former Cambodian leader Hun Sen prompted public anger and threatened the collapse of her government.

In the leaked call, Paetongtarn – daughter of the populist former leader Thaksin Shinawatra – discusses an ongoing border dispute with Hun Sen, who is known to be a friend of her family.

In the recording, she can be heard criticising a senior Thai military commander who she said “just wanted to look tough”, describing him as an opponent. Addressing Hun Sen as “uncle”, she adds that if there were anything he wanted to “just let me know, I’ll take care of it”.

Paetongtarn told a press conference on Thursday: “I would like to apologise for the leaked audio of my conversation with a Cambodian leader which has caused public resentment.”

Hun Sen, who ruled Cambodia for almost four decades, was succeeded by his son, Hun Manet, the current prime minister, in 2023, but remains politically powerful.

Paetongtarn said her comments were a negotiating tactic, but this has done little to quell public anger.

The Thai foreign ministry summoned the Cambodian ambassador on Thursday to deliver a protest letter complaining about the leaking of the call. The full version was released by Hun Sen after the initial clip was leaked.

The phone call threw Paetongtarn’s government into chaos, threatening to destroy the uneasy partnership formed between her family and their former rivals in the military.

The conservative Bhumjaithai party – the second largest in the coalition – pulled out of the ruling coalition, leaving her government with a slim majority. Leaders of the Chartthaipattana, United Thai Nation and Democrat parties held urgent talks on the crisis on Thursday afternoon but have not withdrawn.

If another coalition partner were to pull out, it could make her position untenable and could force an election, or an attempt by other parties to cobble together a new coalition.

Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, leader of the opposition People’s Party, earlier called for Paetongtarn to dissolve parliament to prevent groups from exploiting the situation “and inciting an incident that could harm the democracy”, warning against a military coup.

Thailand’s government has been challenged by a dozen coups since the end of absolute monarchy in 1932, and for the past two decades the country’s politics has been dominated by a power struggle between the military and Paetongtarn’s family, the Shinawatras. Her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, was ousted in a 2006 coup, and her aunt Yingluck was removed from power by a court ruling followed by a coup in 2014.

Hundreds of anti-government protesters, some of them veterans of the royalist, anti-Thaksin “Yellow Shirt” movement of the late 2000s, demonstrated outside Government House on Thursday, demanding that Paetongtarn quit.

Ken Lohatepanont, a Thai political analyst, said that “while a coup is no longer completely unthinkable” it did not appear likely yet, adding: “The democratic process has not yet reached an impasse.”

Thailand’s military said in a statement that army chief Gen Pana Claewplodtook “affirms commitment to democratic principles and national sovereignty protection”.

“The Chief of Army emphasised that the paramount imperative is for ‘Thai people to stand united’ in collectively defending national sovereignty,” it said.

Paetongtarn, who has been in office less than a year, is also facing legal threats. At least three petitions have been filed against the leader over the leaked call, including to the National Anti-Corruption Commission, accusing her of ethical misconduct and violating the constitution, and to the Central Investigation Bureau, accusing her of offences against national security. The Election Commission has also been urged to investigate.

The crisis comes at a time when the Thai economy is struggling, with a fall in Chinese visitors hitting its tourism industry, and the threat of US tariffs of 36% looming.

Paetongtarn has not responded to calls for her to resign, but has sought to convince the public that her government stands united with the military as it responds to the dispute with Cambodia.

“Now, we have no time to fight among ourselves. We must defend our sovereignty, and the government is ready to support the armed forces by all means. We will work together,” she said.

On Friday, Paetongtarn will travel to Thailand’s northeast, where clashes have occurred, to meet with Lt Gen Boonsin Padklang, the commander of the forces in northeast Thailand, whom she criticised in the call.

GIMPO – Prisoners of war held for decades after the fighting stopped. Civilian abductees. Defectors. Separated families.

They are Koreans who symbolize the decades of division and bitter animosities between North and South Korea, which have been split by a heavily fortified border since the the 1950-53 Korean War.

Recommended Videos

North and South Koreans aren’t allowed to exchange visits, phone calls or letters with their loved ones on the other side.

Wednesday is the 75th anniversary of the war's beginning. The Associated Press spoke with Koreans whose pain and sorrow likely won't be healed anytime soon as diplomacy between the Koreas remains dormant.

South Korean prisoner of war isolated after his return home

Lee Seon-wu, who was a South Korean soldier, lost three fingers and was captured by Chinese troops during a fierce battle in the eastern Gangwon province in the final days of the war. Like tens of thousands of other South Korean prisoners, Lee was held by North Korea even after an armistice ended the fighting. He was forced to resettle as a miner in the country's remote northeast.

In North Korea, Lee said he belonged to the lowest social class and married a poor woman. He also lived under constant state surveillance.

In 2006, he fled to South Korea via China, only to learn that his parents and two of his three siblings had already died. Lee said he was shunned by his nephew, who likely worried Lee would demand the return of land that was originally bought with compensation money that authorities gave to his family after they wrongly concluded that Lee had died in the war.

Now 94, he doesn’t stay in touch with any relatives in South Korea and misses family members in North Korea.

Lee said his three daughters in North Korea rejected his offer to flee to South Korea because they feared punishment if caught. Lee said he also has a grandson whose parents — Lee’s son and daughter-in-law — died in an accident.

“I'm happy because I've returned to my homeland but I shed tears when I think about them in North Korea,” Lee said during an interview at his home in Gimpo, a city near Seoul.

A total of 80 South Korean POWs have fled to South Korea since 1994, but only seven of them including Lee are still alive. In 2016, the South Korean government estimated about 500 South Korean POWs were still alive in North Korea.

North Korean daughter fights for her late South Korean POW dad

Son Myong Hwa, 63, is the North Korea-born daughter of a South Korean POW held in the North. She said her father sang and played the harmonica well but often drank alone at home and wept.

Son's father, who also worked as a miner in North Korea, died of lung cancer in 1984. Son said he left a will asking her to move his ashes to his South Korean hometown when the Koreas are unified.

Son escaped to South Korea in 2005 and brought her father's remains to South Korea with the help of her brother and sister in North Korea in 2013. Her father’s remains were eventually buried at the national cemetery. But Son said her demand for the government to give her father's compensation to her has gone unanswered because South Korean law only grants financial assistance to returning POWs, not their bereaved families.

Son has been fighting legal battles to get what she thinks she deserves. She said she can't back down now because she has lost too many things. She said she learned that her brother and sister involved in the smuggling of their father's remains were later arrested by North Korean authorities and sent to a prison camp. The trouble has left Son estranged from her two other sisters who also resettled in South Korea.

“Why am I struggling like this? I harbor ill feeling against South Korean governments because I think they've abandoned POWs left in North Korea,” Son said. “I think deceased POWs also have honors to be respected so their compensation must be provided posthumously.”

South Korean son flies balloons for his father abducted to North

In 1967, when Choi Sung-Yong was 15, his father was abducted by North Korean agents, whose armed vessels encircled his fishing boat near the Koreas’ disputed western sea boundary.

Choi said that South Korean officials and a North Korean defector told him that his father was executed in the early 1970s after North Korean interrogators uncovered his wartime service for a U.S. intelligence military unit.

Choi said his family still doesn't hold an annual traditional memorial service for his father because they don’t know exactly when he died. He said before his mother died in 2005, she asked him to bring his father's remains and bury them alongside hers in the future.

Now, as head of a civic group representing families of people kidnapped by North Korea, Choi flies balloons across the border to drop leaflets demanding that North Korea confirm the fates of his father and others.

“I want to hear directly from North Korea about my father,” Choi said.

The South Korean government estimates more than 500 South Korean kidnap victims, mostly fishermen, are still held in North Korea.

Choi faces police investigations after the new liberal South Korean government cracked down on civilian leafleting campaigns to ease tensions with North Korea.

Choi said Tuesday that senior South Korean officials told him they would strive to resolve the abduction issue as they asked him to halt balloon activities that North Korea views as a major provocation.

“Our governments have failed to fulfill their duties to find the fate of my father. So I’ve sent leaflets. But why do South Korean authorities try to punish me?” Choi said. “Criminals are in North Korea.”

South Korean hoping to meet his North Korean half-siblings

When Kang Min-do’s family gathered for major traditional holidays, he said his North Korea-born father often wept quietly when he honored the two other children he lost during the chaos of the Korean War.

Kang, who was born to a woman his father remarried in South Korea, said his father told him bombings, likely from U.S. warplanes, scattered his family somewhere near Pyongyang in January 1951 as they were fleeing to South Korea.

“My father said he tried to search for them after the bombing ended, but bodies were piled so high and he just couldn’t find anyone,” Kang, 67, said.

Before he died in 1992, Kang’s father hoped that his son would find his half-siblings one day to tell them how much their father missed them. In a video message posted on a South Korean government website, Kang expressed hopes of visiting his father’s grave with his half-brother and half-sister when the Koreas are unified.

“I need to tell them how much our father struggled after coming to the South and how deeply he missed his older son and daughter,"" Kang said.",GNews,,,not found,,,,"wdiv clickondetroit, WDIV, ClickOnDetroit, Local 4 News Detroit, clickondetroit.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wdiv-clickondetroit/,https://ground.news/interest/click-on-detroit,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/wdiv-4-media-bias,LEAST BIASED (-0.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,,,,Center,Very High,Center,Center,Unknown,Center,Center,clickondetroit.com,,wdiv clickondetroit,84,USA,Y,J,WDIV ClickOnDetroit,
80,204,UN peacekeeper killed in attack by armed men in Central African Republic,https://apnews.com/article/central-african-republic-un-peacekeeper-fa0b7331468d9a5945797dc737a642e5,2025-06-24T23:07:57Z,The Associated Press,US,border,"DAKAR, Senegal (AP) — A United Nations peacekeeper was killed during an attack by armed men in Central African Republic, the UN said on Tuesday as the Security Council expressed concerns over growing attacks against peacekeepers in the country.

A Zambian peacekeeper was killed Friday when suspected Sudanese armed groups attacked a U.N. peacekeeping patrol team close to the country’s northern border with Sudan in the village of Am-Sissia 1, according to a statement from the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.

A second peacekeeper was injured and is undergoing medical treatment.

The victim was identified as 33-year-old Stephen Muloké Sachachoma, a member of the Zambian military with MINUSCA, the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the Central African Republic.

Mulambo Haimbe, Zambia’s minister of foreign affairs and international cooperation, demanded that those responsible be brought to justice in accordance with international law.

“Zambia remains resolute in its commitment to advancing international peace and security as a foundation for sustainable development, both at regional and global levels,” Haimbe said in a statement.

It marked the third attack this year against the U.N. peacekeeping mission in the country, often carried out by armed groups vying for control and targeting security forces in conflict-hit areas.

“The members of the Security Council expressed their deep concern over the increasing number of attacks against peacekeepers in the Central African Republic,” said the Office of the Spokesperson for the Secretary-General.

Central African Republic has been battling conflict since 2013, when predominantly Muslim rebels seized power and forced then President François Bozizé from office. A 2019 peace deal only partially lessened the fighting, and six of the 14 armed groups that signed it later withdrew from the agreement.

The country is among the first in Africa to welcome Russia-backed forces, with Moscow seeking to help protect authorities and fight armed groups. However, these forces have been accused of human rights violations and, in some cases, exacerbating security issues.

June 20 (UPI) -- U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have discovered and closed a tunnel carved into the ground between San Diego and Tijuana that stretched more than 1,000 feet into the United States, the agency announced Thursday.

The agency said the tunnel, located near the Otay Mesa Port of Entry, had an exit point near a commercial warehouse. The tunnel entrance was discovered in a residential area in the Mexican border town of Tijuana, and had been concealed with freshly laid tile, CBP said.

""The investigation revealed the tunnel was equipped with electrical wiring, lighting, ventilation systems and a track system designed for transporting large quantities of contraband,"" a CBP release said.

The tunnel stretched nearly 3,000 feet, spanning the United States and Mexico border and measured nearly 4 feet high and more than 2 feet wide.

It is the latest in a long series of tunnel discoveries in the Southwest.

Drug and human smugglers have used clandestine, underground tunnels along the U.S.-Mexico border for decades and routinely use them to move drugs and people into the United States.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection has discovered more than 95 tunnels in the San Diego area alone since 1993. They are also routinely discovered in other border states, including Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.

According to the agency, the San Diego Sector Tunnel Team found the tunnel while it was still ""actively under construction."" Even though the tunnel was not yet complete, officials say at its current stage, it was estimated to be about 2,918 feet long. Border Patrol believes it was intended to have an exit point near a California commercial warehouse space.

Border Patrol, Homeland Security, and Mexico officials were able to locate the entrance point, which they way was at a Tijuana residence. After serving a warrant, officials say they found that the tunnel entrance had been covered up with a freshly-laid tile floor.

84,35,Thailand-Cambodia border dispute: How a leaked phone call between a former strongman and a young leader could topple a government,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/19/asia/thailand-cambodia-border-dispute-paetongtarn-intl-hnk,2025-06-19T09:20:23Z,Cable News Network,US,border,"CNN —

Thailand’s Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra is facing increasing pressure to step down, after appearing to criticize the military in a 17-minute leaked phone call she had with Cambodia’s powerful former leader over an escalating border dispute.

The scandal, which sparked widespread anger in the country, brings fresh uncertainty to a country roiled by years of political turbulence and leadership shake-ups. Paetongtarn, 38, has only held the premiership for ten months after replacing another prime minister who was removed from office.

It also comes at a time when the Southeast Asian kingdom is struggling to boost its ailing economy, is negotiating a trade deal with the United States to avoid punishing tariffs, and is embroiled in an escalating border dispute with its neighbor Cambodia that has soured relations to their lowest point in years.

Paetongtarn apologized on Thursday and Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the Cambodian ambassador to deliver a letter of protest, calling the leak of the private phone call “a breach of diplomatic etiquette.”

“Thailand views that these actions are unacceptable conduct between states. It contradicts internationally accepted practices and the spirit of good neighborliness” and “undermined the trust and respect between the two leaders and countries,” a ministry spokesperson said in a statement.

In a post on his official Facebook page, Hun Sen said he had shared a recording of the call with about 80 Cambodian officials and suggested one of them may have leaked the audio. The 72-year-old political veteran later posted a recording of the 17-minute call in its entirety.

In the leaked call, which took place on June 15, Paetongtarn could be heard calling former Cambodian strongman Hun Sen “uncle” and appeared to criticize her own army’s actions in after border clashes led to the death of a Cambodian soldier last month.

Paetongtarn, a relative political newcomer from a powerful dynasty who became Thailand’s youngest prime minister last year, appeared to signal there was discord between her government and the country’s powerful military.

In the call, the Thai prime minister can be heard telling Hun Sen that she was under domestic pressure and urged him not to listen to the “opposite side,” in which she referred to an outspoken Thai army commander in Thailand’s northeast.

“Right now, that side wants to look cool, they will say things that are not beneficial to the nation. But what we want is to have peace just like before any clashes happened at the border,” Paetongtarn could be heard saying.

She also added that if Hun Sen “wants anything, he can just tell me, and I will take care of it.”

Her comments in the leaked audio, which was confirmed as authentic by both sides, struck a nerve in Thailand, and opponents accused her of compromising the country’s national interests. The Bhumjaithai party, a major partner of the prime minister’s government, withdrew from the coalition on Wednesday, dealing a major blow to her Pheu Thai party’s ability to hold power.

“Paetongtarn compromised her position as prime minister and damaged Thai national interest by kowtowing to Hun Sen,” said Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a professor of political science at Chulalongkorn University. “Her exit is a matter of time and she could be liable for further charges.”

The handling of the border dispute has also stoked nationalist fervor in both countries. In Thailand, conservative forces have called for Paetongtarn to face charges and resign. In Cambodia, thousands of people joined a government-organized rally last week in solidarity with the government and military over the issue.

Thailand and Cambodia have had a complicated relationship of both cooperation and rivalry in recent decades. The two countries share a 508-mile (817-kilometer) land border – largely mapped by the French while they occupied Cambodia - that has periodically seen military clashes and been the source of political tensions.

Paetongtarn on Wednesday tried to downplay her remarks to Hun Sen, saying at a press conference she was trying to diffuse tensions between the two neighbors and the “private” call “shouldn’t have been made public.”

The prime minister said she was using a “negotiation tactic” and her comments were “not a statement of allegiance.”

“I understand now, this was never about real negotiation. It was political theater,” she said. “Releasing this call… it’s just not the way diplomacy should be done.”

Hun Sen, the veteran leader who ruled Cambodia with an iron-fist for almost 40 years, stepped down in 2023 and handed power to his son Hun Manet.

But he remains a hugely influential figure in Cambodian politics, he currently serves as senate president and is a friend and ally of Paetongtarn’s father, the former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.

Border dispute

Tensions between the two neighbors worsened last month, when a Cambodian solider was killed during a brief clash between Thai and Cambodian troops in which both sides opened fire in a contested border area of the Emerald Triangle, where Cambodia, Thailand and Laos meet.

Thai and Cambodian forces said they were acting in self-defense and blamed the other for the skirmish.

Although military leaders from Thailand and Cambodia said they wished to de-escalate, both sides have since engaged in saber-rattling and reinforced troops along the border.

Thailand took control of border checkpoints, imposed restrictions on border crossings and threatened to cut electricity and internet to Cambodia’s border towns. Cambodia in return stopped imports of Thai fruit and vegetables and banned Thai movies and TV dramas.

Cambodia also filed a request with the UN’s International Court of Justice to seek a ruling over disputed border areas with Thailand, including the site of the most recent clash.

However, Thailand does not recognize the ICJ’s jurisdiction and claims that some areas along the border were never fully demarcated, including the sites of several ancient temples.

In 2011, Thai and Cambodian troops clashed in a nearby area surrounding the 11th century Preah Vihear temple, a UNESCO World heritage site, displacing thousands of people on both sides and killing at least 20 people.",GNews,-6.23,,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnn-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.09,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/,https://ground.news/interest/cnn,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.7),USA,,TV Station/Website,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Turner Broadcasting System,1980,-1.3,Lean Left,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,edition.cnn.com,,cable news network,57,USA,Y,F,CNN,
85,204,The US plans to open a fly factory in Texas as part of its fight against a flesh-eating parasite,https://apnews.com/article/fly-factory-texas-flesheating-screwworm-cattle-5eb62edc42bcfce40cdbea27b5f8b60c,2025-06-19T01:40:41Z,The Associated Press,US,border,"The U.S. government plans to open what amounts to a fly factory by the end of the year, announcing its intent Wednesday to breed millions of the insects in Texas near the border with Mexico as part of an effort to keep a flesh-eating parasite from infesting American cattle.

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins said sterile male New World screwworm flies bred at the $8.5 million facility would be released into the wild to mate with females and prevent them from laying the eggs in wounds that become flesh-eating larva. It would be only the second facility for breeding such flies in the Western Hemisphere, joining one in Panama that had largely kept the flies from migrating further north until last year.

The fly’s appearance in southern Mexico late last year has worried agriculture and cattle industry officials and veterinarians’ groups, and the U.S. last month suspended imports of live cattle, horses and bison from Mexico. The U.S. Department of Agriculture also plans to spend $21 million to convert a facility for breeding fruit flies near Mexico’s southernmost border with Guatemala into one for breeding sterile New World screwworm flies, but it won’t be ready for 18 months.

The U.S. bred and released sterile New World screwworm flies into the wild decades ago, and it was largely banished from the country in the 1960s. Previously, it had been an annual scourge for cattle ranchers and dairy farmers, particularly in the Southeast.

“The United States has defeated NWS before, and we will do it again,” Rollins said. She held a news conference at Moore Air Base with Texas and cattle industry officials.

Mexican Agriculture Secretary Julio Berdegué said in a post Wednesday on X that Rollins’ plan “seems to us a positive step in different aspects, it will strengthen the joint Mexico-US work.”

“We trust the enthusiasm for cooperation that Secretary Rollins mentioned, and based on objective results and the reports from the USDA mission visiting us this week, we will be able to restart exports of our cattle as soon as possible,” he said.

The new Texas facility would be built at Moore Air Base, less than 20 miles (32 kilometers) from the Mexico border, and the USDA said it would also consider building a companion fly-breeding center there so that up to 300 million flies could be produced a week. The Panama facility breeds about 100 million a week, and the one in Mexico could breed as many as 100 million as well.

The USDA has said the flies have been detected as close as 700 miles (1,127 kilometers) from the U.S. border, and some U.S. agriculture and cattle industry officials have worried that if the migration isn’t checked, the flies could reach the border by the end of summer. Pressure from the U.S. prompted Mexico to step up efforts to control the fly’s spread.

Buck Wehrbein, a Nebraska cattle rancher and the president of the National Beef Cattlemen’s Association, said Moore Air Base had a fly-breeding facility in the 1960s that helped eradicate it in the U.S.

While there are treatments for New World screwworm infestations, cattle industry officials still worry that farmers and ranchers could see huge economic losses. They, agriculture officials and scientists also said the larva can infest any mammal, including household pets, and it has occasionally been seen in humans.

“The only way to protect the American cattle herd from the devastating threat of New World screwworm is by having a sufficient supply of sterile flies to push this pest away from our border,” Wehrbein said.

Texas officials said they are grateful that the U.S. is taking the screwworm threat serious and pleased with the plans for combating it, including the new facility in Texas.

Officials in other states are watching the fly’s migration as well and see having sterile male flies outnumber the non-sterile one is crucial to checking its migration.

“We have a real concern about wildlife because of their ability to cross the border unchecked somewhat, whether it’s feral pigs, deer, wild cattle, whatever the case may be,” Kansas Animal Health Commissioner Justin Smith said in a recent interview. “There’s an opportunity for them to be our exposure risk.”",GNews,-2.46,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.81,"the associated press, Associated Press, AP, apnews.com, ap, ap news, associated press",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press-apnews/,https://ground.news/interest/ap,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/associated-press-media-bias,,,,,,,,Left,Cooperatively owned,1846,-3.02,,,Unknown,Unknown,Left,Left,Left,apnews.com,,the associated press,32,USA,,,,

Kitchen, who had published articles on his ""Kitchen Counter"" Substack about Columbia campus protests over the Israel-Hamas war, claimed border officials explicitly told him ""the reason you have been detained is because of your writing on the Columbia student protests.""

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) categorically denied a political motivation for detaining him, stating Kitchen ""was denied entry because he gave false information on his ESTA [Electronic System for Travel Authorization] application regarding drug use.""

categorically denied a political motivation for detaining him, stating Kitchen ""was denied entry because he gave false information on his ESTA [Electronic System for Travel Authorization] application regarding drug use."" The Committee to Protect Journalists called Kitchen's deportation ""a clear case of retaliation in connection with his reporting.""

In mid-June 2025, an X user posted several screenshots of an Australian man's Bluesky post claiming he was detained at Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) for 12 hours and sent back to Australia. The X post (archived) quickly gained traction, accumulating 3.6 million views and sparking widespread discussion about U.S. border enforcement and press freedom.

The man behind the widely circulated post was Alistair Kitchen, 33, an Australian writer who told Snopes via email that he pursued a master of fine arts degree in nonfiction writing at Columbia University from 2022 to 2024. Snopes contacted the university to confirm his enrollment status and awaits a response. Kitchen was a 2018 Schwarzman Scholar at Tsinghua University.

He claimed (archived) that he was targeted by U.S. authorities because of his pro-Palestinian blog posts about campus protests (archived) at Columbia University in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war. Kitchen posted (archived) on Bluesky that he ""was denied entry, detained, and deported from the USA over the last 48 hours because of my reporting on the Columbia student protests."" In subsequent posts, he detailed his interaction with border officials this way:

They just came out and said it: ""We both know why you've been detained…it's because of what you wrote about the protests at Columbia"" — Alistair Kitchen (@alistairkitchen.bsky.social) June 13, 2025 at 9:27 PM

However, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) strongly disputed this characterization. An agency spokesperson provided a statement to Snopes defending the detention:

Under the leadership of the Trump Administration and Secretary Noem, we have the most secure border in American History. This has allowed CBP [Customs and Border Protection] to focus to actually vet and interview the people attempting to come into our country. Lawful travelers have nothing to fear from these measures, which are designed to protect our nation's security. However, those intending to enter the U.S. with fraudulent purposes or malicious intent are offered the following advice: Don't even try.

The spokesperson rejected Kitchen's claims about political targeting:

Allegations that Alistair Kitchen was arrested for political beliefs are unequivocally false. The individual in question was denied entry because he gave false information on his ESTA [Electronic System for Travel Authorization] application regarding drug use. If a traveler violates the terms of their ESTA application, they may be subject to detention and removal. Using the ESTA is a privilege, not a right, and only those who respect our laws and follow the proper procedures will be welcomed.

The Electronic System for Travel Authorization is a program that allows citizens of certain countries, including Australia, to travel to the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. Applicants must answer questions about health, criminal history and drug use; any false statement can lead to denial of entry.

Kitchen's account of how the drug issue emerged differs from the official explanation. In an interview with Australian Radio National's ""The Radio National Hour"" program, Kitchen described customs officials first questioning him about his political activities, then conducting what he characterized as an extensive search of his phone's private contents:

That was the most violating experience that I've ever had. I can tell you that I'm proud of who I am and the life that I lead. Nonetheless, the experience of having your entire persona given away to an entire state turns out to be demeaning in ways they didn't fully understand.

According to Kitchen, only after this phone search did officials claim to find evidence of drug use. Kitchen maintains the timing was connected to his political writings, saying ""it's extremely clear to me that they only got to that information and only use that information exactly because of my writing on the conflict.""

In response to Snopes' questions via email, Kitchen clarified what happened when officials claimed to have found evidence:

Yes, they explicitly said they had found evidence of drug use. No, they did not present me with that evidence. In that moment, I had no idea it existed or did not exist, and, afraid to be accused of lying, I admitted to past drug use. Today, phone once again in hand, I see my phone did not hold the degree of evidence I was led to believe, and I profoundly regret complying with their interrogation.

Kitchen also claimed in his interview with Australian Radio National that the ESTA system has created leverage against certain travelers:

The question exists exactly to encourage people to lie on the form, which gives customs and border patrol an immense point of leverage once they have taken you to secondary processing. So this is a deliberate way of creating and using power to make sure that undesirables — journalists, sex workers, people of certain races — do not make it into the country.

Kitchen had written about Columbia University protests

Kitchen had published several articles on his personal blog, Kitchen Counter, about Columbia University's campus protests, including a seven-part series (archived), titled, ""Liberation Zone,"" a set of dispatches he says he wrote while still a student at Columbia in 2024. The posts chronicled events on campus during the encampment and documented the day-to-day developments of the protest movement.

In a later post (archived) in March 2025, titled, ""On the Deportation of Dissent,"" Kitchen described the demonstrations as ""a concerted act; a coming together of groups Jewish, Muslim, Christian, and others too, to exert strategic pressure on an institution indirectly funding the massacre of peoples far away.""

In his interview with Australian Radio National, Kitchen claimed that border officials questioned him about his political views on the Israel-Hamas war:

My view on whether a one or two state solution is appropriate to solve the Israel-Gaza conflict, I was asked to do it. I was also asked to name Jews who I was friends with. I was asked to name Muslims that I was friends with. I was asked what I thought about Israel generally, what I thought about Hamas. I was asked all manner of questions regarding this conflict that obviously have nothing to do with whether or not I'm suitable to enter the United States.

Kitchen also said border agents demanded his phone passcode and downloaded the device's contents.

Kitchen said he had attempted to minimize potential problems by deleting certain social media posts before traveling, but said officials were still able to access the content. He warned (archived) other travelers, ""if you are deleting social media ~48 before your flight to the US, it is already too late.""

Government officials described standard detention procedures

When asked by Snopes about the extensive political questioning Kitchen described, CBP provided procedural context. ""Interviewing a traveler applying for admission into the United States is part of the admissibility process. This is a lawful routine procedure,"" a CBP spokesperson said.

The agency confirmed that when travelers are found to be inadmissible, they must wait for available flights back to their country of origin, sometimes requiring overnight detention ""in a comfortable waiting area at the airport.""

CBP also confirmed it is ""standard practice that when a subject is removed from the country, their travel documents and phone are placed into a packet and given to the airline.""

The case occurs amid broader Trump administration immigration policies

The incident occurred amid the Trump administration's expanded immigration enforcement efforts. On April 9, 2025, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services announced it would begin considering what it termed ""aliens' antisemitic activity on social media and the physical harassment of Jewish individuals"" as grounds for denying immigration benefit requests, affecting those applying for lawful permanent resident status, foreign students and those affiliated with educational institutions linked to what the agency called ""antisemitic activity.""

The Committee to Protect Journalists issued a statement (archived) calling Kitchen's experience ""a clear case of retaliation in connection with his reporting"" and warned it ""sends a chilling message to journalists that they must support the administration's narratives or face forms of retribution.""",GNews,-2.31,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.44,"snopes.com, Snopes, snopes.com  ",,https://ground.news/interest/snopescom,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/snopes,LEAST BIASED (-0.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"David P.

87,210,US workers say Trump’s immigration crackdown is causing labor shortages: ‘A strain on everybody’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/29/trump-immigration-crackdown-labor-shortages-slowdowns,2025-07-29T11:00:05Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"Donald Trump’s crackdown on immigration is piling pressure on US factories, according to employees and union leaders, as veteran workers from overseas are forced to leave their jobs.

As economists warn the administration’s full-scale deportation ambitions could ultimately cost millions of jobs, workers at two sites – in Michigan and Kentucky – told the Guardian that industrial giants are grappling with labor shortages.

The US president has moved to strip more than a million immigrants of their legal status in the US, including by shutting down the Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans (CHNV) Parole Program, which allowed hundreds of thousands to work legally in the country. It has meanwhile ramped up immigration arrest operations with prospective daily quotas of 3,000 arrests per day.

Such moves have piled pressure on industries across the US economy – including the food, hospitality, construction, transportation and care sectors – which rely on large numbers of migrants to do essential work.

At a GE Appliances plant in Louisville, Kentucky, more than 125 workers were abruptly forced out of their jobs in the spring due to programs cancelled as part of Trump’s immigration crackdown, according to an employee. GE Appliances makes home appliances including refrigerators, microwaves and dishwashers.

“In three different buildings, on a couple of different shifts, stewards reported that they lost production so they weren’t able to make all the products they were supposed to make,” said Jess Reese, a replacement operator at the plant and organizer for IUE-CWA Local 83761. “It was hard to cover certain job tasks on the assembly line, and so that created chaos, and it was just hard to get things done.”

Reese expressed concern about the threat of more workers being forced out. Trump’s efforts to revoke protected status for Haiti could impact an additional 200 union members next February, she said. “Hundreds of workers kind of disappearing at the drop of a hat is no joke, as we’ve seen with the last wave of mass terminations.”

A spokesperson for GE Appliances said: “We added additional staffing where needed and continue to follow the law.”

At a Kraft-Heinz plant in Holland, Michigan, meanwhile, workers are said to have been mandated to work overtime. The firm is one of the largest food and beverage companies in the world, behind brands including Philadelphia cream cheese and Jell-O deserts.

“We had people there for 20 years, and all of a sudden they get notification their immigration authorization is revoked,” Tomas Torres, a maintenance mechanic of 13 years, and president of RWDSU Local 705. “And they can’t be there anymore, and that just puts a strain on everybody,.

“The lack of people on the lines. There are employees running two machines; it should be one person per machine. Manager and supervisors are all stressed out, and cancelling vacations for people because they don’t have enough to run the machines.”

Torres has been working 12- to 14-hour days, he said: part of a first shift, all of a second shift, and part of a third shift.

“I’m tired. And you catch people falling asleep on the line, and it’s a big safety issue,” he added. “All of this that has happened has affected everybody at the plant. It’s crazy, because I hear people complain every single day.”

Kraft Heinz refuted the plant is experiencing labor shortages due to immigration policy changes, but did not say how many workers were lost at the plant due to the changes.

“Kraft Heinz has strict work authorization verification processes that comply with all applicable laws and regulations,” said the firm in a statement. “Overtime is driven by the needs of the business, and we are currently in one of our busiest seasons of the year.”

As Trump’s officials press ahead, economists have warned that deporting millions of immigrants from the US could have drastic consequences. The Economic Policy Institute estimated this month that 4 million deportations would result in the loss of 3.3 million jobs held by immigrants in the US and 2.6 million US-born employees, hitting industries including construction and childcare.

The American Enterprise Institute, a conservative thinktank, meanwhile found that Trump’s immigration policies would likely lead to a negative net migration into the US for the first time in decades and result in a decrease in US gross domestic product of between 0.3% and 0.4%, or $70.5bn to $94bn in economic output, annually.

“One day they are there,” said Maria Jose Padmore, a human services assistant for Fairfax County in Virginia. “And the next day, I’m looking for my coworker, and he’s gone because their Temporary Protected Status expired.

“Forget about the fact that I now have to share my coworkers’ job. Let’s think about my coworkers’ family: how are they going to put food on their table?”

Padmore was speaking at a panel on how Trump’s immigration polices are affecting workers, organized by the AFL-CIO in Washington DC this month. Gwen Mills, President of Unite Here, the largest hospitality union in the US, said they were “wreaking havoc across the families of our coworkers and in our communities”.

“Oftentimes within the labor movement, we find ourselves divided by industries,” said Jimmy Williams, president of the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, which represents construction workers. “When it comes to immigration, it’s gotta be the one single thing that puts a thread between a hotel worker, a construction worker, a service worker, a public employee, a teacher. This is something that affects every single working person in this country.”

The Trump administration alleges that CHNV and other temporary protected status programs were abused, a claim challenged by groups such as Refugees International.

“There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force, and President Trump’s agenda to create jobs for American workers represents this Administration’s commitment to capitalizing on that untapped potential while delivering on our mandate to enforce our immigration laws,” said Abigail Jackson, White House spokesperson.

But its policies are already causing apprehension on the factory floor. “This has a real impact on immigrant workers, obviously, but it also has a real impact on non immigrant workers,” Reese, at the GE Appliances plant in Louisville, said. “It’s really important that we stick together, because we all want the same things.

“We want safe workplaces. We want good wages. We all want to go home to our family in one piece. We want to live in a safe place. We want to be free. These are things we all share, and we’re only going to get that stuff if we stick together.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
88,48,Coventry City Council workers could be deported after immigration rule change,https://www.coventrytelegraph.net/news/coventry-news/coventry-city-council-workers-could-32152310,2025-07-29T04:00:00Z,Coventry Telegraph,GB,immigration,"Families are facing fear, anxiety and possibly deportation following a U-turn by Coventry City Council who say it will no longer sponsor work visas for employees after previously telling them that it would. That is the warning from one worried employee who said the decision felt unfair and confusing, with promises to staff being broken and leaving them with an uncertain future.

Changes to immigration rules were laid out before Parliament at the start of July and these include skills and salary thresholds increases, the end of overseas recruitment for care workers, and more than 100 occupations no longer being able to access the immigration system. The salary threshold for most health and care workers is £25,000. For skilled worker applicants in place before April 2024, the general salary threshold will increase from £29,000 to £31,300. For applicants after that date, the threshold will increase from £38,700 to £41,700.

An email from a concerned council worker who wishes to remain anonymous, explained that the council's sudden change of policy could not have come at a worse time, with the changes making it nearly impossible for many migrant staff to stay in the UK legally. He explained: ""The decision has shocked and hurt many of the people who have worked hard to make Coventry a better place. Many were hired under the belief that the council would help with their visa sponsorship. Some were even directly told this last year. The council had sponsored other employees in the past, so this new stance feels unfair and confusing.

""What makes it worse is that those most of those affected come from different countries and ethnic backgrounds, raising serious concerns about equality and discrimination. Coventry City Council proudly promotes values like being 'open and fair' and supporting 'equality and diversity' but actions speak louder than words.

""Refusing to sponsor these dedicated workers now, especially when they are running out of time to find new jobs that meet the stricter salary requirements, does not reflect these values. Instead, it leaves families facing fear, anxiety, and possibly deportation.

""These workers are not just employees, they are part of the community. Many of them have saved the council thousands of pounds through their hard work. They’ve cared for vulnerable people, solved housing problems, supported public services, and made life better for Coventry residents. In return, they are now being cast aside with no backup plan.

""The situation is not just sad it’s deeply troubling. The council knows that these people will struggle to find new jobs before the deadline yet they have chosen to walk away from their responsibility, leaving people hopeless and under extreme stress.

""The council must act with compassion and integrity. It’s time to honour promises made, protect the most vulnerable, and live up to the values they claim to represent.""

A Coventry City Council spokesperson said: “New legislation introduced over the last 18 months has led to changes in how the scheme works and the salary levels it offers, and the council has to comply with these changes. Unfortunately, this means there will be some current employees who will not meet the new requirements.

""We are currently undergoing a full review, and this includes offering advice and support to those affected, as well as creating a clear policy for how the scheme can operate in the future. As a council we remain committed to offering support wherever we can to help all residents, and to the ideals of welcome, diversity and inclusion that the city of Coventry holds so dear. In this instance, we have to follow a legal requirement, which we will do while offering the help we can to those affected.”",GNews,,,not found,,,,"coventry telegraph, Coventry Telegraph, coventrytelegraph.net, coventry live, coventrylive",not found,,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,coventrytelegraph.net,,coventry telegraph,248,UK,,,,
604,27,Mass Migration Driving Record Population Growth in Britain,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/07/31/disaster-mass-migration-drives-near-record-population-growth-in-britain/,2025-07-31T12:06:11Z,Breitbart News,US,mass migration,"Mass migration was the overwhelming driver of near record high population growth in England and Wales last year, sparking warnings that Britain is fighting for its very “survival”.

The three top years for population growth in modern history were 2022, 2023, and 2024 says the Office for National Statistics, revealing the population of England and Wales rose by 706,881 people in the year up to mid-2024 to a total of 61.8 million people.

The official statistician noted that 98 per cent of the population growth was due to the net migration of 690,147 during the time period, the BBC states.

In comparison, natural population growth, or the number of births compared to deaths, only accounted for an addition of 29,982 people to the population.

The population growth was the second-highest recorded since 1949, when official records began.

However, last year’s numbers only trailed those from the prior year, when the population rose by 821,210 in large part as a result of the post-Brexit immigration reforms instituted by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson.

This came as a result of the Johnson government opening up migration paths for non-EU nations and refusing to institute a hard annual cap on migration, despite having vowed to the public that he would cut immigration, as successive previous Tory governments also failed to deliver.

Commenting on the data, the ONS’s Nigel Henretty said: “Net international migration continues to be the main driver of this growth, continuing the long-term trend seen since the turn of the century.”

Professor Matt Goodwin said that the figures represented a “disaster” for Britain and said that the government must halt mass migration and begin to enact pro-family policies as a matter of urgency, as is done in nations such as Hungary, Israel, and Poland.

Appearing on GB News on Wednesday evening, Prof Goodwin said: “This is about the survival of the country… The West and Western nations now need to start talking about family policy in terms of survival.”

Goodwin suggested that the government could create generous tax incentives for families, but stressed that they should only be limited to British citizens and not be accessible to foreign nationals, as are many state benefits in modern Britain.

The professor also highlighted the issue of housing as a crucial factor in family formation, attributing the supply crunch and soaring prices to mass migration. Notably, only around 124,000 houses were built in Britain last year, significantly fewer than the number of migrants admitted into the country.

“You can have affordable, available housing in this country, or you can have mass, uncontrolled immigration. You cannot have both. And we need a political leader that has the guts to stand up and say that to the British people,” he said.

Professor Goodwin has recently sounded the alarm about the demographic effects of the mass migration agenda imposed on the country by both Westminster establishment parties, producing a report last month which found that if current trends continue, the white British population will become a minority in their own country by 2063 and would fall to just 22.7 per cent by 2100.",NewsAPI,13.55,,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Mixed,31.01,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/,https://ground.news/interest/breitbart,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/breitbart,RIGHT (8.1),MIXED (6.4),USA,,Website,High Traffic,LOW CREDIBILITY,Right,Breitbart News Network LLC,2007,6,Right,Mixed,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,breitbart.com,,breitbart news,41,USA,Y,H,Breitbart,Y

Five people were detained during a crackdown on illegal e-bikes in Coventry. Police were deployed on the Burges.

Coventry Police was joined by Immigration Enforcement (IE) on Thursday (July 24). Together, they swooped on Deliveroo and Just Eat riders near McDonalds and KFC on Cross Cheaping.

Officials detained five people for immigration offences, and they were subsequently questioned. CoventryLive has asked the Home Office whether those found to be working illegally will be deported.

A spokesman for the Home Office said: “Illegal working undermines honest employers and undercuts local wages. It is against the law to work in the UK when you have no right to be here.

“We have announced a new agreement which will see data shared between the Home Office and food delivery companies to help identify hotspots for illegal working and take action against those involved.”

Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) Simon Foster is campaigning to halve the time it takes to destroy e-bikes seized by West Midlands Police. Currently, they have to be stored for 14 days, which he wants slashed to seven, as previously reported by CoventryLive.

Mr Foster described e-bikes as a 'growing threat' across the West Midlands. Some are illegally modified to reach speeds of up to 70mph. He said: “Vehicles are often being used to commit crime and cause fear in our communities, and their presence can be both dangerous and intimidating.”

Coventry MP Taiwo Owatemi, who has been working closely with Mr Foster, added: “Everyone, including children, older residents, and people with mobility issues, should feel safe moving around our city. E-bikes are not allowed in pedestrianised zones, and illegal modifications that increase their speed make them even more dangerous.

“I am pleased to see that Simon Foster is focused on tackling e-bike misuse and raising awareness about how to use them responsibly and legally. Keeping our public spaces safe and welcoming must be a shared priority.”

91,210,Dining across the divide: ‘A 31-month sentence for the Tory councillor’s wife seems a bit harsh’,https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2025/jul/27/dining-across-the-divide-andrew-oliver,2025-07-27T11:00:22Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"Andrew, 49, Leeds

Oliver, 39, Leeds

Occupation English-language examiner and Labour councillor

Voting record Labour

Amuse bouche He was hit by lightning when he was a toddler, indoors, standing by a metal sink. Unsurprisingly, he doesn’t remember it

For starters

Andrew It was nerve-racking, like a blind date. You don’t want to appear to be the arsehole, but you do want to get your point across. I had two veggie bao buns to start, and a tomato linguine. We shared a fruity bottle of white wine, and had coffee afterwards.

Oliver I arrived feeling curious. I had a bread and olives platter and a poke salad, and we had a potato rosti on the side. A carb overload!

The big beef

Andrew Our disagreement on immigration concerned the small boats. We agreed that one of the drivers of immigration is the need for low-paid workers to do jobs that people don’t want to do. You can pay £2,000 a week for dementia care, and yet the person looking after the patient is paid the minimum wage. It’s easier for corporations to lobby for higher levels of immigration than pay a fair wage.

Oliver People can feel undercut if unscrupulous employers basically use people as cheap labour. Andrew wasn’t blaming individuals. He could see why people would do it. But, equally, I can absolutely see why somebody who’s working in a lower-paid job or who’s got a particular trade can feel undercut.

Andrew My point was: why don’t people use the legal routes? I didn’t realise that, even when someone does apply through a legal asylum process, it can take five years to get settled in the new country. Some of the situations people are in mean they’re going to be dead in about a year. So I don’t blame them for coming over that way. I’d do the same.

Oliver Immigration and refugee protection systems, nationally and internationally, are struggling to keep up with criminal gangs, which have identified a clear demand and make vast amounts of money.

Sharing plate

Andrew I have concerns about the treatment of women and gay people in Muslim-majority countries – it’s completely out of kilter with how we do it. Before meeting Oliver, I assumed that if you’re found out to be gay in Saudi, you die.

Oliver I think Andrew would want to see more Muslim figures publicly stating their support for LGBTQ+ rights. As a gay man who has worked for five years in Saudi Arabia and for three years in Kurdistan, Iraq, I feel that it’s more nuanced. It depends on the particular community – there’s no such thing as one Muslim ideology, just as there’s no such thing as one Christian ideology.

For afters

Oliver We talked about Lucy Connolly, the Tory councillor’s wife who was jailed for calling for asylum seekers’ hotels to be set on fire after the Southport killings. What she wrote was horrific, and caused real terror to people inside hotels, who had already had pretty traumatic experiences. There should be consequences for things that people post online, if it incites harm or hatred against people.

Andrew A sentence of 31 months seems a bit harsh. I’m not saying she’s innocent; she deleted her tweet after four hours and it had a quarter of a million views. But they’ve not left themselves any wiggle room. Kneecap allegedly said “Kill your local MP” during a show, and MPs have been killed in the past – they didn’t face charges, but should they then have been given 31 months?

Takeaways

Andrew The biggest thing I’ll take away is that the legal route to claim asylum doesn’t work. I hadn’t appreciated how long it takes and how difficult it is.

Oliver It’s really important to have respectful conversations with people with different perspectives – and to listen to the emotion and the experience behind their opinions, not simply jump to a conclusion about what kind of person holds it.

704,28,Gulf Cartel Kills Top Mexican Federal Prosecutor in Border City Attack,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/08/05/gulf-cartel-kills-top-mexican-federal-prosecutor-in-border-city-attack/,2025-08-05T16:09:00Z,Breitbart News Network,US,border,"A squad of gunmen believed to be with the Gulf Cartel shot and killed a top Mexican federal prosecutor during a brazen attack in the border city of Reynosa, Tamaulipas. The attackers used grenades and automatic weapons. The gunmen managed to escape with complete impunity as Mexican government officials try to claim the region is safe and work to contain the public opinion fallout.

The attack took place on Monday afternoon along Boulevard Hidalgo, one of the busiest avenues in the city of Reynosa. A group of gunmen in a white SUV blocked off a vehicle driven by Ernesto Cuitláhuac Vásquez Reyna, threw a grenade at him, and began firing. After multiple bursts of automatic gunfire, the gunmen sped off. At the same time, other Gulf Cartel members began carrying out blockades and throwing road spikes along some of the main avenues in the city in an attempt to slow down authorities and allow the gunmen to escape.

Vazquez Reyna was the regional delegate for Mexico’s Attorney General’s Office (FGR). Hours after the attack, the Tamaulipas government issued a prepared statement worded in such a way that officials tried to minimize the incident, claiming that a government official had died along a city street and noting that witnesses had heard gunfire. As usual, Tamaulipas government officials made no mention of the automatic weapons or grenades used in the attack by the Gulf Cartel.

The targeted killing comes soon after Mexican federal authorities, under pressure from the U.S. government, had been forced to crack down on the Gulf Cartel’s fuel theft and fuel smuggling operations based in Reynosa.

According to Mexican law enforcement sources consulted by Breitbart Texas, these raids upset the current leadership of the Metros faction. The cartel operators then lashed out in retaliation against Mexican authorities for the federal government not keeping their side of an accord of sorts where the criminal organization’s businesses were to be protected.

93,210,Trump news at a glance: president tells Europe to ‘stop the windmills’ ahead of EU and UK trade talks,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/27/president-trump-administration-news-updates-today,2025-07-27T01:42:57Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"Donald Trump spent the night at his family-owned golf resort in Scotland but took time to criticise European leaders over wind turbines and immigration, claiming there won’t be a Europe unless they “get their act together”.

“I say two things to Europe. Stop the windmills. You’re ruining your countries. I really mean it, it’s so sad. You fly over and you see these windmills all over the place, ruining your beautiful fields and valleys and killing your birds,” he said.

“On immigration, you better get your act together or you’re not going to have Europe any more.”

Intensive negotiations continued on Saturday between the EU and the US before a crunch meeting in Scotland between Trump and the European Commission president, Ursula von der Leyen, seeking to avert a costly trade war.

Here’s more on this and the day’s other key Trump administration stories.

Trump skips press meeting to play golf before US-EU talks Donald Trump abandoned a scheduled meeting with the press on Saturday morning for a round of golf at his seaside course in Turnberry, with music blaring from the buggy he drove. During what is billed as a four-day family visit to Scotland, Trump is meeting European leaders and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, raising hopes of new and refined trade deals with the EU and the UK. On the prospects of an EU trade deal, the US president has said there are “20 sticking points”. When asked what they were, he said: “Well, I don’t want to tell you what the sticking points are.” He described Ursula von der Leyen as a “highly respected woman” and said the meeting on Sunday with the EU chief would be “good”, rating the chances of a deal as “a good 50-50”.

Democrats request copy of Epstein ‘birthday book’ House Democrats on Friday sent a letter to the attorneys representing the estate of Jeffrey Epstein requesting a copy of the so-called “birthday book” that reportedly contains a crude poem and doodle from Donald Trump in celebration of the late sex offender’s 50th birthday. In the letter, California congressmen Ro Khanna and Robert Garcia say the contents of the book may be “essential” to congressional oversight of the Trump administration’s handling of the Epstein controversy. In the letter, they ask for a “complete and unredacted” copy of the book by 10 August. Read the full story

Doge reportedly using AI tool to create ‘delete list’ of federal regulations The “department of government efficiency” (Doge) is using artificial intelligence to create a “delete list” of federal regulations, according to a report, proposing to use the tool to cut 50% of regulations by the first anniversary of Donald Trump’s second inauguration. The “Doge AI Deregulation Decision Tool” will analyze 200,000 government regulations, according to internal documents obtained by the Washington Post, and select those it deems to be no longer required by law.

Trump says Cambodia and Thailand agree to ‘immediate’ ceasefire talks Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to “immediately meet” to work out a ceasefire, according to Donald Trump, who spoke to the leaders of both countries as he sought an end to clashes that continued for a third consecutive day. In social media posts, Trump said: “Both parties are looking for an immediate ceasefire and peace”, adding he would not negotiate a trade deal with either side until the fighting stopped.

On Saturday morning, he abandoned a scheduled meeting with the press, who travelled with him on Air Force One, for a round of golf at his seaside course with music blaring from the buggy he drove.

Sky News, stationed next to the course, reported the songs included Billy Joel’s Uptown Girl, Elaine Paige’s Memory and Simon and Garfunkel’s Bridge over Troubled Water.

Billed as a four-day family visit to Scotland, Trump is meeting European leaders and the British prime minister, Keir Starmer, raising hopes of new and refined trade deals with the EU and the UK.

On the prospects of an EU trade deal, the US president has said there were “20 sticking points”. When asked what they were, he said: “Well, I don’t want to tell you what the sticking points are.”

He described von der Leyen as a “highly respected woman” and said the meeting on Sunday with the EU chief would be “good”, rating the chances of a deal as “a good 50-50”.

It is understood von der Leyen and her aides will fly in on Saturday, with the European trade commissioner, Maroš Šefčovič, arriving on Sunday morning.

It is expected the deal will centre on an outline agreement in principle over 15% tariff rates for exports including cars, but with a 50% tariff continuing on steel. There may also be a breakthrough deal on pharmaceuticals, setting a rate of 15% for exports.

Although this would breach a longstanding World Trade Organization agreement that medicines are rated at a zero tariff, it would be a far cry from the 200% tariff Trump threatened to impose on pharmaceuticals earlier this month.

This would have triggered a highly damaging trade war not just with Ireland, where many US multinationals are based, but Germany, Denmark, Belgium, France and Spain.

Von der Leyen’s spokesperson, Paula Pinho, said: “Intensive negotiations at technical and political [level] have been ongoing between the EU and US. Leaders will now take stock and consider the scope for a balanced outcome that provides stability and predictability for businesses and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic.”

It is believed the meeting will be held in Turnberry late afternoon and will be followed by a series of meetings with Starmer on Monday, with hopes he will widen the bare bones trade deal he struck in May.

Trump’s arrival in Scotland has required the biggest security operation since Elizabeth II died in 2022. More than 5,000 police and security personnel are involved in the four-day visit with no risks taken after the assassination attempt on the president a year ago.

High perimeter fences have been erected around the coastal golf course with naval vessels patrolling the shore while security drones overhead and dozens of security detail staked out the resort early on Saturday.

The heavy security presence may be a foretaste of events to come later in August when the US vice-president, JD Vance, and his family arrive for a holiday in the Cotswolds, reportedly in the village of Charlbury.

95,210,She fled Cuba for asylum – then was snatched from a US immigration courtroom,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/26/cuba-asylum-seeker-ice-courtroom,2025-07-26T09:00:48Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"Jerome traveled a thousand miles from California to El Paso, Texas, so he could accompany Jenny to her immigration hearing. He and his wife had promised to take her after she had fled Cuba last December, after the government there had targeted her because she had reported on the country’s deplorable conditions for her college radio station.

Everything should have been fine. Jenny, 25, had entered the United States legally under one of Joe Biden’s now-defunct programs, CBP One. By the end of the year, she could apply for a green card.

But a few days before her hearing, Jerome started to feel like something was off. Jenny’s court date had been abruptly moved from May to June with no explanation. Arrests at immigration courthouses peppered the news.

And when Jenny went before the court, the government attorney assigned to try to deport her asked the judge to dismiss her case, arguing vaguely that circumstances had changed.

Instead, the judge noted that Jenny was pursuing an asylum claim and scheduled her for another court date in August 2026 – the best possible outcome.

“She turned around and looked at me and smiled. And I smiled back, because she understood that she was free to go home,” Jerome said.

But as Jenny left the courtroom and approached the elevator to leave, a crowd of government agents in masks converged on her and demanded she go with them. Just before she disappeared down a corridor with the phalanx of officers, she turned back to look at Jerome, her face stricken, silently pleading with him to do something.

“I said, ‘She’s legal. She’s here legally. And you guys just don’t care, do you? Nobody cares about this. You guys just like pulling people away like this,’” Jerome recalled telling the agents. “And nobody said a word. They couldn’t even look me in the eye,” he told the Guardian.

Footage of her apprehension was taken by those advocating for her and shared with the Guardian.

Now Jenny is languishing in immigration custody. Her hearing for August 2026 has been replaced with a date for next month when the government attorney might once again attempt to dismiss her case, and her case been transferred from a judge who grants a majority of asylum applications to one with a less than 22% approval rate.

“There’s no heart, there’s no compassion, there’s no empathy, there’s no anything. [It’s] ‘We’re just going to yank this woman away from you, and we don’t care,’” Jerome said. The Guardian is not using his or Jenny’s full name for their safety.

Similar scenes have played out again and again at immigration courthouses across the country for weeks, as people following the federal government’s directions and attending their hearings are being scooped up and sent to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) detention.

The unusual tactics are happening while Donald Trump and his deputy chief of staff for policy, Stephen Miller, push for Ice to make at least 3,000 daily arrests – a tenfold increase from during Biden’s last year in office. Ice agents have suddenly become regulars at immigration court, where they can easily find soft targets.

At first, the officers appeared to focus arrests on a subset of migrants who had been in the US for fewer than two years, which the Trump administration argues makes them susceptible to a fast-tracked deportation scheme called expedited removal. Ice officers seem to confer with their agency’s attorneys, who ask the judge to dismiss the migrants’ cases, as they did with Jenny. And, if judges agree, the migrants are detained on their way out of court so that officials can reprocess them through expedited removal, which allows the federal government to repatriate people with far less due process, sometimes without even seeing another judge.

But reporting by the Guardian has uncovered how Ice is casting a far wider net for its immigration court arrests and appears also to be targeting people such as Jenny whose cases are ongoing and have not been dismissed. The agency is also snatching up court attendees who have clearly been in the US for longer than two years – the maximum timeframe that according to US law determines whether someone can be placed in expedited removal – as well as those who have a pathway to remain in the country legally.

After the migrants are apprehended, they’re stuffed into often overcrowded, likely privately run detention centers, sometimes far from their US-based homes and families. They’re put through high-stakes tests that will determine whether they have a future in the US, with limited access to attorneys. And as they endure inhospitable conditions in prisons and jails, the likelihood of them having both the will to keep fighting their case and the legal right to stay dwindles.

“To see individuals who are law-abiding and who have received a follow-up court date only to be greeted by a group of large men in masks and whisked away to an unknown location in a building is jarring. It breaks my understanding and conception of the United States having a lawful due process,” said Emily Miller, who is part of a larger volunteer group in El Paso trying to protect migrants as best they can.

One woman Miller saw apprehended had come to the US legally, submitted her asylum petition the day of her hearing, and was given a follow-up court date by the judge before Ice detained her.

“My physical reaction was standing in the hallway shaking. My body just physically started shaking, out of shock and out of concern,” Miller said. “I have lived in other countries where I’ve been a stranger in a strange land and did not speak the language or had limited language abilities. And as a woman, to be greeted by masked men is something we are taught to fear because of violence that could happen to us.”

Elsewhere in Texas, at the San Antonio immigration court earlier this month, a toddler dressed in pink and white overalls ran gleefully around the drab waiting room. Far more chairs than people lined the room’s perimeter, as if more attendees had been expected. A constantly multitasking employee at the front window bowed her head in frustration as the caller she was speaking to kept asking more questions. Self-help legal pamphlets hung on the wall – a reminder that the representation rate for people in immigration proceedings has plummeted in recent years, and the vast majority of migrants are navigating the deportation process with little to no expert help.

In one of the courtrooms, a family took their seats before the judge. Their seven-year-old boy pulled his shirt over his nose, his arms inside the arm holes. The government attorney sitting with a can of Dr Pepper on her desk promptly told the judge she had a motion to introduce, even as the family filed their asylum applications. She wanted to dismiss their cases, she said, as it was no longer in the government’s best interest to proceed.

The judge said no. She scheduled the family for their final hearings just over a year later. And she warned them, carefully, that Ice might approach them as soon as they left her courtroom. What happened next, she said, was not in her control.

Her last words to the family: “Good luck.”

Men in bulletproof vests were hanging around in the hallway, but the family safely made it into the elevator and left the courthouse for the parking lot. Stephanie Spiro, associate director of protection-based relief at the National Immigrant Justice Center (NIJC), said that for the most part, Ice is leaving families with children alone (with notable exceptions). It’s “single adults” they’re after, people who often have loved ones in the US depending on them, but whose immigration cases involve them alone, she said.

A few days later, two such adults – a man and a woman – separately went before a different immigration judge in San Antonio, whose courtroom had signs encouraging people to “self-deport”, the Trump administration’s phrase for leaving the country voluntarily before being removed.

The government attorney that day moved to dismiss both the man’s and the woman’s cases, which the judge granted, dismissing the man’s case even before the government attorney had given a reason why.

Using a Turkish interpreter, the judge then told the man it was likely that immigration authorities would try to put him into expedited removal – despite the fact that he had entered the US more than two years earlier.

Soon after, the woman – who had been in the country for nearly four years – went before the court without a lawyer. The judge tried to explain to her what might happen if her case were dismissed, but as he finished, she admitted in Spanish: “I haven’t understood much of what you’ve told me.”

The woman went on to say that she was deep in the process of applying for a visa for victims of serious crimes in the US – a visa that provides a pathway to citizenship. But the judge was upset with her for not also filing an asylum application, and he threatened to order her repatriated. It was the government attorney who “saved” her, the judge said, by requesting the case be dismissed instead.

As soon as the woman walked out of the courtroom, agents approached her and directed her out of the hallway, into a small room. Around the same time, outside the building, men wearing gaiters over their faces ushered a group of people into a white bus, presumably to be transported to detention.

Spiro of the NIJC, meanwhile, works in Chicago and said she and fellow advocates have documented Ice officers in plainclothes coming to immigration court there with a list of whom they’re targeting – and court attendees are apprehended whether or not their case is dismissed.

“People are getting detained regardless,” Spiro added. “And once they’re detained, it makes it just so much harder to put forth their claim.”

Migrants picked up at the court in Chicago have been sent to Missouri, Florida and Texas – to detention spaces that still have capacity, but also to where judges are more likely to side with the Trump administration for speedier deportations. Many of them end up far from their loved ones, and a lag in Ice’s publicly accessible online detainee locator has meant some of them have at times essentially disappeared.

As word of mouth has spread among immigrant communities in Chicago about these arrests, the once bustling court has gone eerily quiet, Spiro said. That, in turn, could have its own serious consequences, as no-shows for hearings are often ordered deported.

“They don’t want to leave their house because of the detentions that are happening,” Spiro said of Chicago’s immigrants. “So to go to court, and to go anywhere – they don’t want to come to our office. To go anywhere where there’s federal agents and where they know Ice is trying to detain you is just terrifying beyond, you know, most people’s imagination.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

A woman donned in a Union Jack dress was denied entry to a Wetherspoon pub during an anti-illegal immigration protest in a Nottinghamshire town. Tanya Ostolski, who was part of the protest, claimed she was refused service at her local pub, The Picture House in Sutton-in-Ashfield.

A spokesperson for Wetherspoon confirmed that the pub's manager had requested patrons not to enter with flags or placards, stating it was ""important not to increase tensions"". This decision sparked outrage among some protesters clad in Union Jack attire, leading to confrontations with the bouncers as they were denied access to their local on Friday night, 25th July.

Following approximately two hours of protests around the town centre from about 4.30pm, the crowd reconvened near their starting point, just 50 metres away from the pub. By around 7pm, most people had dispersed from the area close to the venue.

Tanya, 54, a resident of the town, claims she was initially turned away due to carrying a St George's cross flag, but even after stowing it in her bag, she was still denied entry.

She stated: ""I go in there all the time and they refused entry. They didn't let me in with my flag (separate from the dress), the flag is the English flag, so why shouldn't I be allowed to have an English flag?"", reports Nottinghamshire Live.

""It's our flag, it's our nation's flag. I wasn't being aggressive or anything I didn't get lairy or anything. I put the flag back in my bag, and they said I can't come in because of my dress.

""They kept refusing me. I'm probably going to get barred now. They just said Tanya, you're not coming in. I feel absolutely disgusted, why should I be refused entry for wearing a dress or a flag?"".

JD Wetherspoon's ""no-flags"" policy is widely recognised. The chain faced criticism during the 2018 World Cup when its numerous outlets were told not to display England flags bearing the St George's Cross, or flags from any other nation, throughout the tournament.

Rather than flags, the establishments were adorned with bunting representing all 32 participating countries.

However, during the men's Euro 2024 championship, the well-known pub company overturned its prohibition on England flags being displayed at its venues for the summer's European tournament. Last June, Wetherspoon confirmed that individual pubs could choose to show flags if they wished to mark the sporting occasion.

Addressing today's incident in Sutton-in-Ashfield, Wetherspoon spokesman Eddie Gershon said: ""Pub managers have a duty under the licensing laws, and as a matter of common sense, to judge every situation on its particular circumstances.

""In this case, the pub manager felt that it was important not to increase tensions. Therefore, on this occasion the manager asked customers not to enter with flags or any placards.""

The incident occurred during an anti-immigration demonstration in Sutton-in-Ashfield. Furious demonstrators assembled in the town following social media posts by MP Lee Anderson regarding a local rape case.

The MP for Reform UK alleged that a man charged with rape in Sutton in Ashfield, within his constituency, is an asylum seeker, a claim which Nottinghamshire Live has been unable to confirm.

Following these allegations, posts on Mr Anderson's X and Facebook pages incited protesters to assemble in the town centre. A counter-protest was also organised, although those protesting against illegal immigration outnumbered the counter-protesters.

The mood in the town was extremely tense, with individuals shouting ""stop the boats"" and attributing high levels of migration to Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.",GNews,,,not found,,,,"plymouth live, Plymouth Herald, plymouthherald.co.uk",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/plymouthlive-bias-and-credibility/,https://ground.news/interest/plymouth-herald,not found,LEAST BIASED (1.5),HIGH (1.0),United Kingdom,0,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,High,Center,Center,Unknown,Unknown,Center,plymouthherald.co.uk,,plymouth live,99,United Kingdom,,,,
98,213,Sahm: Grow the economy? Not with these immigration restrictions.,https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/29/sahm-grow-the-economy-not-with-these-immigration-restrictions/,2025-07-29T10:45:04Z,The Mercury News,US,immigration,"According to the White House and congressional Republicans, the new budget law will spark economic growth of more than 3%. Reaching that goal, however, will be made far more difficult by a provision they see as central to the law: the $150 billion-plus it adds to immigration enforcement. The administration’s agenda of sharply lower immigration and mass deportations is bad for growth.

Unauthorized immigrants — persons who entered the country illegally or received a temporary, humanitarian status at entry — are the administration’s primary focus as it restricts entry into the U.S., revokes humanitarian visas and deports those already in the country without authorization. To bolster those efforts, the new law includes $70 billion to increase border security and $75 billion for interior enforcement operations. It raises fees for applying for humanitarian visas and work authorizations and imposes a 1% excise tax on remittance transfers.

The result will be a smaller population and labor force, and the adverse effects on growth are likely to be substantial.

After a surge from 2021 to 2024, unauthorized immigration is expected to fall sharply this year. Researchers at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas estimate that a near halt in unauthorized immigration would reduce GDP growth by 0.8 of a percentage point this year. (For context, average annual U.S. GDP growth for the last decade is about 2.5%.) If President Donald Trump’s administration is able to reach its goal of 1 million deportations a year, then the drag on growth would intensify — subtracting 1.5 percentage points from GDP growth in 2027.

This level of deportation had previously been viewed as unattainable, mostly because the enforcement agencies lacked the resources to carry it out. This law could change that, making Immigration and Customs Enforcement the best-funded of all federal law-enforcement agencies.

Near full employment

The disruptions in the labor market from less immigration would be compounded by the fact that the U.S. economy is currently close to full employment. The unemployment rate among U.S.-born workers was 2.7% in 2024, compared to 3.8% for foreign-born workers.

The White House argues that reducing immigration and increasing deportations would free up jobs for U.S.-born workers, but the types of jobs that unauthorized immigrants most commonly hold are much less likely to be held by U.S.-born workers. Unauthorized immigrants are eight times more likely than U.S.-born workers to be house cleaners, for example, and more than twice as likely as authorized immigrants. The most common jobs for unauthorized immigrants also tend to offer lower pay and be more physically demanding.

The stark occupational differences make it less likely that deporting unauthorized immigrants will create job opportunities for U.S.-born workers. In fact, mass deportations might even harm U.S.-born workers.

Research has found that an immigration enforcement program from 2008 to 2013 reduced the employment and wages of U.S.-born workers. While U.S.-born and unauthorized immigrants may not be competing for the same job, their jobs can often be complementary. For example, a reduction in the supply of construction laborers could lead to a decrease in the demand for construction-site managers. Also, deportations would reduce the contributions of unauthorized immigrants to the local demand for goods and services, which could weigh on the local labor market.

AI won’t fill gap

And automation and AI won’t be able to immediately fill the gap left by fewer unauthorized immigrants. As with U.S.-born workers, there is an occupational mismatch. For example, AI can currently replace tasks of data analysis in professional and clerical jobs, as opposed to manual work that unauthorized immigrants often perform. Advances in robotics could fill more of that gap — but at additional cost.

Mass deportations and tighter immigration controls could also have a chilling effect on authorized immigration, including workers and students in STEM fields, which could slow the development of new technologies. These immigrants tend to make their peak contributions to productivity several years after arrival. Their absence could subtract from longer-term growth, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

With an aging workforce and falling fertility, the U.S. needs a forward-looking immigration policy — one that goes beyond “less immigration and more deportation.” Without immigration, the U.S. population will begin to decline in 2033, which would be a constraint on the economy. If the White House wants to reach its goals for increasing U.S. economic growth, it should reconsider its goals for restricting U.S. immigration.

The British national has prior charges and convictions related to drug and weapons possession, officials reported.

Special Agents with ICE Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) quickly “reunited” Ahmed Mohamed with his handcuffs,” according to a post on social media by ICE officials.

“After escaping ICE custody with the help of pro-illegal alien activists, Ahmed Mohamed of the U.K. was swiftly apprehended and placed back into ICE custody,” officials stated. He now faces additional charges for escape from a federal facility.

The Telegraph reported that Mohamed escaped from ICE custody with the assistance of “left-wing activists.” The escape occurred as the British illegal alien was being transferred to an ICE detention facility in California.

HSI officials told The Telegraph that “Mohamed, who has been charged with narcotics and weapons offences, was shackled and being frogmarched to an ICE facility in downtown Los Angeles when a masked man, understood to be a pro-immigration protester, helped him to escape while guards were distracted.”

The activists loaded Mohamed into an awaiting van and drove off with him, ICE officials stated.

HSI agents launched a manhunt for the escaped criminal alien and reunited him with his handcuffs three days later when San Diego HSI agents found him at an undisclosed location.

The New York Post reported that Mohamed was arrested while wearing a $1,700 Louis Vuitton t-shirt.

100,45,Scammers Are Using Fake Lawyers and Court Dates to Steal Immigrants' Money. Here's What to Look Out For,https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/scammers-are-using-fake-lawyers-and-court-dates-to-steal-immigrants-money-heres-what-to-look-out-for/,2025-07-29T05:02:00Z,CNET,US,immigration,"Scammers are pretending to be immigrants' friend or worst nightmare to con them out of their money. Seng Kui Lim/Getty Images

For some immigrants looking for a better life in the US, the American dream has been something out of a nightmare lately.

The Trump administration is determined to deport undocumented people, whether they have a criminal record or not, with the administration suggesting that they will try to deport 1 million immigrants a year.

Understandably, you may be unnerved right now, even if you're an immigrant in the country legally. Scammers know that. In fact, they're counting on it -- and have concocted cons designed to take advantage of immigrants' anxiety and desperation to remain in the country.

""The scam landscape is getting nastier and more specific by the week,"" said Shane Lucado, an attorney and founder of InPerSuit.com, a website that helps people find lawyers. ""The worst abuse I see today involves immigrants, from new arrivals, language learners or first-timers dealing with U.S. systems.""

What immigration scams are popular right now

Many scammers are ditching the strategy of posing as Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, Lucado said. These scams still exist, but criminals will now also pretend to lend you a helping hand with your case.

""Now they act like they are on your side,"" he said. ""They say they work with USCIS (US Citizen and Immigration Services). They spoof agency phone numbers. They use exact government letterhead. And then they say your paperwork has a mistake.""

There is really no shortage of immigration scams that have been reported across the country. Spoiler alert: They all ask you to pay up, or else. Common immigration scams can include:

Fake government officials claiming to be a part of ICE have contacted immigrants in California and told them that they are at risk of being deported but can avoid it if they pay a fine.

Undocumented immigrants in Colorado have been approached on social media and WhatsApp by ""immigration agents."" They set up a staged Zoom appointment with USCIS agents offering asylum if victims make a wire transfer using Zelle or Western Union.

In New York City, an asylum seeker was advised by a fake attorney to stay away from his in-person court hearing (the argument being that he might be deported) and instead attend an online hearing. The man paid his fake attorney money in installments, shelling out close to $5,000 before learning he was being scammed. Meanwhile, he missed his real court hearing and was ordered to be deported.

A visa-related scam that has been making the rounds nationwide is Middle Eastern students lawfully living in the US being targeted by scammers. They try to convince the victims that there's something wrong with their paperwork, and they could be sent home unless they pay up.

How to avoid immigration scams

Swindlers are craftier than ever at devising scams. Luckily, there are some red flags you can look for.

Too good to be true deals

If you've been stressing over your legal status for some time, and suddenly, out of nowhere, you're working with a company that makes it sound like all of your troubles are going to soon vanish, you should be skeptical, according to Marina Shepelsky, a New York City-based attorney who specializes in immigration, visas, divorce and family law.

Listen closely for the phrase, ""expedited processes."" This should set off alarm bells in your head. Similarly, anyone who identifies themselves as a consultant, notary or solo paralegal is probably up to no good.

You've been approached over the phone, email or social media

It's not that you couldn't be working with a reputable person on the phone or through email. In many situations, you could. But it matters whether you initiated the conversation or if the so-called immigration expert or lawyer came to you.

""USCIS or ICE will not give you a warning call,"" Shepelsky said. ""They will send you a letter and just show up at your door, speaking from our experience.""

Stay far away from ""phishing, where someone will text or email asking for personal information or payment under the disguise of an official communication,"" she added.

You feel pressure to make a payment

This is a classic red flag. But it's a tactic that works well for scammers since many undocumented immigrants already feel pressured to act in the current political climate. Oftentimes, scammers know a lot of your personal information, sometimes even your case number.

""So when they speak with authority, your brain skips logic and goes into fix-it mode. This is emotional hijacking,"" Lulado said. ""They target those between processes, which are people applying for asylum, waiting on work permits or stuck in visa renewal loops.""

The payment method requested is odd

Scammers don't like paper trails that might lead back to them, so they tend to use payment methods that make it hard for law enforcement to find them later.

No matter how pressured you feel, refrain from paying anyone with gift cards or payment apps like Zelle. No reputable government or legal official is going to ask you to make a payment in this way. And if someone is threatening to deport you, they won't ask for money at all. You'll just be detained.

Research the attorney you hire

Immigrants navigating the judicial system should always work with a credentialed and licensed immigration lawyer. Shepelsky says that most states have a searchable online directory of licensed attorneys, as well as barred ones.

The Department of Justice also has an online list of immigration attorneys who have been disbarred. They could still be scammers even if they're not on the list, but it's another way to check a lawyer's credentials.

Always search a lawyer's first and last name in the directory of the state they practice law in. You could also try the American Bar Association, which will link you to a directory of lawyers that are licensed in your state.

What to do If you fall for an immigration scam

In the aftermath of falling for any scam, you may feel too embarrassed to call attention to yourself and avoid doing anything. But don't do nothing.

""If someone becomes a victim after paying $800 for a fake visa, they should gather all receipts, screenshots and conversations,"" Lucado said. ""Send everything to the [state] attorney general's office and the state bar. That filing usually triggers an inquiry within 30 days.""

If that unnerves you given the current political climate, or you feel you need more help, Lucado says that there are free and low-cost legal clinics that may be able to assist you.

Additionally, you can report the immigration scam to your state's consumer protection office, according to USCIS. Reporting scams will not affect your application. Some states also allow anonymous complaints. You may not get your money back, but by fighting back, you make it harder for scammers to trick their next victim.",GNews,-1.39,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnet-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,40.02,"cnet, CNET, Computer Network, computernetwork, cnet.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnet/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnet,LEAST BIASED (-0.5),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,CBS Interactive,1994,,,,Unknown,Center,Left,Center,Center,cnet.com,,cnet,0,USA,,,,

I fear there will be more desecration to follow. What nature has created with God’s hand needs to be preserved and valued just as the first residents of Florida did for hundreds of years.

People fleeing perilous conditions seek opportunity here

I know a family who came to the United States under very difficult circumstances. They left a tiny village where making a living was always hard. When roving gangs began pillaging homes, killing villagers, and forcing children into their ranks, the family knew they had to flee.

Reaching the United States was dangerous and costly, involving tough travel over land and water. Once here, they found they weren’t entirely welcome. Their culture was different, their clothing unfamiliar, and they didn’t speak the language. They took any job or housing they could get, no matter how hard or unpleasant. Still, they endured, and over time, life improved.

This family didn’t come from Mexico or Central America. They came from Eastern Europe in 1902. I know them because they were my grandparents.

People coming today are driven by the same forces: physical safety and economic opportunity. The difference is that the United States used to have far more open doors. Since around 1930, legal entry to this country has become much harder.

If you were in my grandparents’ shoes, what would you have done?

We’re a country of more than 340 million people. It defies logic to think we can’t legally absorb another 2 million to 3 million people per year.

707,28,ICE DETAINERS: 6 Criminal Aliens Busted in Florida Child Predator Sting — 48 People Arrested in Total,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/08/05/ice-detainers-6-criminal-aliens-busted-in-florida-child-predator-sting-48-people-arrested-in-total/,2025-08-05T12:11:01Z,Breitbart News Network,US,border,"U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers placed immigration detainers on six criminal aliens arrested as part of a multiagency sting operation in Florida targeting child sex predators. One of the criminal aliens arrested was a University of Florida student on a visa who, along with the other defendants, allegedly planned to meet with and sexually abuse children ages 13-15.

Attorney General James Uthmeier announced the arrest of 48 individuals in all, including the six foreign nationals flagged with ICE detainers, Breitbart’s Hannah Knudson reported. The arrests were part of a six-day undercover operation aimed at taking online child predators off the street. The operation, coordinated by the Marion County Sheriff’s Office, marks the highest number of arrests ever made during this annual joint effort to protect Florida children from exploitation and abuse.

In a press release last week, Florida State Attorney General James Uthmeier commented on the operation, saying, “As a father, I am outraged by the heinous crimes we spoke about today. As Attorney General, I’m proud of the brave officers behind this record-breaking operation. They came after children, but Florida and federal law enforcement were waiting for them. Thanks to the Marion County Sheriff’s Office for putting this operation together so these men were stopped before they could harm a single child.”

On Monday, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced the placement of the detainers in a social media posting on X (formerly Twitter), highlighting the identification of the six criminal aliens identified after their arrest in the operation.

The operation exposed the use of Snapchat as a platform to target children. According to law enforcement authorities, predators used various online chat and gaming platforms, including Snapchat, to message and meet with minors, which were undercover officers posing as the minors.

Marion County Sheriff Billy Woods cautioned parents about the dangers posed by online predators, saying, “We will never arrest every single one of them. You have to know what your child is doing online. And children have to know what dangers are lurking online.”

“As a Sheriff and as a father, I understand the anger and disgust a parent has towards these types of individuals,” Woods added in a press conference published by 12News CBS. I assure you that we will continue to attack this plague head-on

The Florida Attorney General’s Office is suing Snapchat for knowingly and willingly violating Florida law. The lawsuit, filed in April, states that rather than obeying Florida law, Snapchat is actively deceiving parents about the risks associated with using the platform.

The six criminal aliens identified after their arrest in the sting operation include suspects from Jamaica, El Salvador, Dubai, and India who travelled to the state of Florida intending to prey on children, according to authorities.

The defendants arrested in the sting operation now face a myriad of criminal charges that include Traveling to Meet a Minor for Illegal Sexual Conduct, Human Trafficking, and Using a Computer to Solicit a Child for Sexual Conduct.

This operation was executed by the Marion County Sheriff’s Office, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Marshals Service, Florida Highway Patrol, Polk County Sheriff’s Office, Ocala Police Department, Port Orange Police Department, and the Lake City Police Department.

103,37,Baltimore protesters show support for Maryland pastor detained by ICE agents,https://www.cbsnews.com/baltimore/news/baltimore-protesters-maryland-pastor-george-fallon-ice/,2025-07-29T03:20:49Z,CBS News,US,immigration,"Protesters rallied in Baltimore on Monday in support of a Maryland pastor who is still being held by U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Louisiana.

As of Monday, Easton pastor and father Daniel Fuentes Espinal, 54, remains in custody at the Winn Correctional Center in Winn Parish, Louisiana.

Maryland pastor detained by ICE

Fuentes Espinal is a church pastor and a construction worker. He has lived in the U.S. since 2001.

ICE said he entered the country legally on a six-month visa, but it has expired for decades. His family said he's attempted to secure a Green Card, and he has no prior criminal record.

Fuentes Espinal was arrested as he was on his way to his day job on Monday, July 21. Fuentes Espinal is also a pastor at Iglesia Del Nazareno Jesus Te Ama in Easton, Maryland.

In a statement, ICE officials said Fuentes Espinal migrated to the U.S. from Honduras and entered the U.S. in 2001 on a six-month visa. After it expired, ICE says he was living in the country illegally.

""It is a federal crime to overstay the authorized period granted under a visitor's visa,"" an ICE spokesperson told WJZ.

After his arrest, Espinal was taken to a detention center in Salisbury, transferred to Baltimore then to the Winn Correctional Facility in Louisiana.

Rally to bring Fuentes Espinal back to Maryland

Many of those who took part in the rally are calling for policy changes at the federal level.

This weekly march from McKeldin Plaza to the George H. Fallon federal building, where Baltimore's ICE detention facility is held, is about advocating for their neighbors.

Fuentes Espinal's supporters say he has no prior criminal record, and his arrest should never have happened.

""[If] a man of faith, a family man who's been here 24 years, can be snatched off the side of the road to a government-sponsored kidnapping, then none of us are safe,"" Len Foxwell, a family friend of Fuentes Espinal, said.

Since his arrest, Foxwell says Fuentes Espinal has had minimal contact with his own family.

""They actually charge $50 for a phone call for a family that's already lost their primary breadwinner. That's a huge financial hit,"" Foxwell said.

Rally goers say this weekly march is about love instead of hate.

""People are leading into that hate, but we can't be doing that anymore. It is too late at this point in the game to hate, and I am imploring everybody to come out here and love instead,"" Annalese Estepp, from Severna Park, said.

Daryl Walsh said he woke up Monday morning and was ""sick to his stomach"" while scrolling social media. He says he saw a video of ICE arresting a Latino man, and decided he wanted to rally to make his voice heard.

Maryland lawmakers denied a tour of the ICE facility

Monday night's rally comes on the heels of some members of the Maryland congressional delegation trying to enter the Baltimore ICE facility earlier in the day, but were denied.

""Why don't they want members of Congress to go in and see with their own eyes, or talk to people who are detained there? Because they want to cover up what's going on,"" Sen. Chris Van Hollen said.

Congressman Andy Harris, who represents Talbot County, where Fuentes Espinal lived, did not try to enter the ICE facility with the rest of the delegation. He was critical of his democratic counterparts on social media.

""These Maryland lawmakers didn't lift a finger to stop illegal immigrants and MS-13 gangs from pouring into our state, but now they're staging ''sit-in' stunts for cameras to keep illegals in Maryland. Spare us the show. We stand with ICE and their mission to keep Maryland safe,"" Harris wrote.

Foxwell says that Fuentes Espinal endured poor conditions while held in Baltimore before he was transferred to a facility in Louisiana.

""Pastor Fuentes Espinal was there for three days. He didn't have a bed to sleep on. He didn't have a place to shower, didn't have a place to brush his teeth, and to be quite honest, he actually needed a bucket for bodily functions. These are inhumane conditions to which no American should be subjected,"" Foxwell said.

U.S. citizen detained by ICE in Florida speaks out

Video of an 18-year-old U.S. citizen being violently arrested in Florida by immigration agents back in May has drawn heavy scrutiny, with advocates saying the expansion of state and local law enforcement's role in illegal immigrant crackdowns contributed to the incident.

Border Patrol and the Florida Highway Patrol were conducting immigration enforcement on May 2 when they detained Kenny Laynez, a high school senior who was on his way to work as a landscaper with two other co-workers and his mother, who was driving.

Video Laynez recorded of the arrest shows an officer telling him, a U.S. citizen who was born and raised in the country, ""You got no rights here. You're an amigo, brother.""

""It hurts me, hearing them saying that I have no rights here because I look like, um, you know, Hispanic, I'm Hispanic,"" Laynez told CBS News.

The car was pulled over for having too many people sitting in the front seat. Two passengers were undocumented, according to Laynez, and officers are seen on the video using a Taser. The teens' two co-workers were both detained, and Laynez says he has been unable to contact them.

""We're not resisting. We're not committing any crime to, you know, run away,"" Laynez said, recalling the arrest.

Laynez's phone continued recording after he was detained, capturing an exchange in which an officer tells another, ""They're starting to resist more. We're gonna end up shooting some of them.""

Another officer replies, ""Just remember, you can smell that too with a $30,000 bonus.""

Florida Highway Patrol did not comment.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection told CBS News in a statement that the individuals ""resisted arrest"" and said immigration agents are facing a surge in assaults while doing their job. The statement made no mention that a U.S. citizen had been detained.

The video comes as Florida is set to deputize more than 1,800 additional law enforcement officers to conduct immigration operations as part of a statewide crackdown.

""Laws are just, you know, they're no longer being respected. They're no longer being upheld,"" said Mariana Blanco, director at the Guatemala Maya Center, an advocacy group that opposes Florida's new crackdown.

On Tuesday, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials announced the arrest of several illegal aliens, including 52-year-old Federico Fong-Nunez of Mexico.

Fong-Nunez has been convicted of 21 different crimes in Boulder, Colorado, including burglary, aggravated assault, and felony menacing.

“President Trump and Secretary Noem have unleashed ICE to target the worst of the worst. Our brave law enforcement is facing an 830% increase in assaults against them and yet they continue to arrest violent criminals and drug traffickers every single day,” the Department of Homeland Security’s Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement:

We will not allow sanctuary politicians, activist hacks, or rioters to stand in our way of protecting the American people. Our message is clear: criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States. [Emphasis added]

In addition, ICE agents arrested 34-year-old illegal alien Luis Alberto Leonardo Cortes-Rivera of Mexico in the sanctuary city of Los Angeles, California. Cortes-Rivera has been convicted nine times of crimes in the United States, including grand theft, burglary, and tampering with a vehicle.

ICE agents in Texas arrested 46-year-old illegal alien Rureiro Falkao of Honduras, whose criminal record includes a conviction for possession of methamphetamine, and 21-year-old illegal alien Jhon Jervis Chavez-De La Rosa, who has been convicted of assault causing bodily injury.

In the sanctuary state of Maryland, ICE agents arrested 21-year-old illegal alien Olinda Micaela Gonzalez-Ortiz of Guatemala, whose criminal history includes a conviction for hit-and-run.

Some 32,000 asylum seekers are being housed in about 210 hotels

An accommodation provider has claimed that migrant hotels are not closing due to estate agents and insurance companies.

‌



Clearsprings Ready Homes told an inquiry “estate agents do not want to work with us as a company” and would rather deal with individuals.

‌



Insurance firms are hiking premiums when they discover asylum seekers are being moved into homes across the country, they claimed.

‌



Another asylum accommodation provider, Serco, warned that planning rules and refurbishment costs are also preventing more hotels from being closed.

It comes as around 32,000 asylum seekers are being housed in about 210 hotels, The Daily Express reports.

‌



The Home Office wants to shut every hotel by 2029 and move migrants into sites such as former student accommodation, disused tower blocks and community homes.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said there is “lots” of housing for illegal migrants last week, despite an intense housing crisis.

Clearsprings Ready Homes, which provides asylum accommodation in London, the South of England, and Wales, has told the Home Affairs Select Committee: “One of the most significant barriers to procurement that the team face is the fact that some estate agents do not want to work with us as a company and their preference is to work in a traditional manner with individuals in the private market.

‌



“Many landlords prefer to rent to the private sector or local authorities because of the amount of work which needs to be completed to make the property compliant.

“Our minimum standards/requirements are much higher than, for example, the local authority, who tend to be able to hand over keys immediately to an empty property which needs to be furnished by the tenant.

“Many insurance companies are now adding a premium to landlord home insurance policies when they find out that asylum seekers are going to occupy the property.

‌



“Sometimes this increase in premium makes the property untenable for the landlord and they withdraw.”

Serco, which provides housing in the North-west, the Midlands and the East of England, added: “The challenges associated with standing up medium sites include upfront costs such as refurbishment, local planning requirements and local community reaction.

“Our experience of identifying medium sites also indicates that the timescales to secure appropriate approvals mean landlords can secure a return on their investment more quickly through alternative utilisation.”

‌



Asylum accommodation provider Mears told the Home Affairs Select Committee: “Ultimately, the main barrier to Mears maximising DA [dispersal accommodation] delivery is the need for a fair and equitable national dispersal regime.

“Each LA [local authority] has an agreed cap on the number of asylum seekers to be housed in their area.

“In NEYH [North-east and Yorkshire and Humber] we are at that cap in all areas where there continues to be appropriate housing to meet the needs of single people and families.

‌



“Areas below the cap are rural in nature and where property is available is often not suitable for dispersal.”

The news comes as protests have broken out in Essex after an asylum seeker was accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl.

Communities are calling for migrant hotels to be closed. Ministers want to partner with councils to buy or lease houses and vacant properties around the UK to house asylum seekers.

‌



The Government could pay councils to buy or renovate property, which they would lease back to the Home Office.

Some hotels have been forced to remain in use for as few as three migrants because of refusals to move out.

Asylum seekers will be threatened with losing their taxpayer-funded accommodation and weekly £49.18 allowance if they reject a transfer request for a second time under a new “firm but fair” policy to reduce the number of asylum hotels.

‌



Reform UK’s Nigel Farage said: “My view is I don’t think any of the young men that crossed the English Channel should be free to walk our streets

“I think the risk, not just the risk of getting involved in the illegal economy, not just the risk to girls and older women.

“I think the terrorism risk, which of course has been writ all too large in the last couple of months with arrests being made as we know, I don’t believe that crossings via small boat should be able to be put in a four-star hotel, put into a house of multiple occupancy and free to roam the streets.

‌



“I’ll go further than that. I don’t think anyone who crosses via that route should ever be eligible for refugee status, should ever be eligible for social housing.

“We are an incredibly generous country. We have given refugee status to half a million people since 2016.

“I don’t think we dare do much more than we already have.

Donald Trump took the opportunity at an impromptu press conference in Scotland to offer advice to Keir Starmer on tackling illegal migrants crossing the English Channel.

Speaking from his golf course, flanked by Sir Keir and his wife Victoria, the President addressed the small boats crisis, drawing parallels with his own policies of deporting illegal immigrants from America.

President Trump issued a warning to the Prime Minister about the individuals arriving on dinghies, labelling them as ""bad people"", yet he commended efforts to halt the crossings.

He shared with the press: ""Immigration is a big factor, and I think frankly if they're coming from other countries and you don't know who they are - are they coming from prisons? We have it where they came in from prisons. We're moving them all out.

""We had zero people come into the country [last month] other than those coming through legal means. If you're stopping immigration and stopping the wrong people my hat's off to you."", reports the Express.

""If the boats are loaded up with bad people, and they usually are because other countries don't send their best. They send people that they don't want - they're not stupid people, and they send the people they don't want.""

Trump commended Sir Keir for adopting a ""much stronger stance"" on the issue of migrant boats compared to the previous government, referencing the Prime Minister's recent deal with France to return migrants to Calais.

Sir Keir has highlighted that during his first year, 35,000 individuals were returned, although only a small fraction of these were involuntary deportations.

He expressed satisfaction with the progress, stating: ""We're very pleased we're getting on with returning people who have got no right to be here.""

The President has voiced concerns about the transformation of Europe into ""a much different place than it was five, ten years ago"" due to mass immigration. He cautioned that unless leaders ""need to get their act together"" there is a risk of losing Europe ""any more as you know it.""

He emphasised the importance of preserving the region's splendour, saying: ""This is a magnificent part of the world and you can't ruin it, you can't let people come here illegally. And what happens is there will be murdered, drug dealers, all sorts of things other countries don't want.""

The Prime Minister faced a significant setback last week when it emerged that prosecutions for people smuggling had dropped to an all-time low, despite his commitment to 'smash the gangs'.

In the period between July 2024 and June 2024, only 153 individuals were prosecuted for assisting illegal entry into Britain, marking a stark decrease from the peak numbers seen during Robert Jenrick's time as immigration minister.

During Mr Jenrick's tenure, 471 people smugglers were prosecuted in 2023, and 424 in 2024. Moreover, of the 43,309 illegal migrants who arrived in Britain in Labour's first 12 months, a mere 446 were charged with immigration offences, which is less than 1% of the total number of crossings.

Mr Jenrick, the shadow Justice Secretary, remarked: ""Keir Starmer boasted he would smash the gangs, but the gangs are laughing at him. They've never had it easier and crossings are up 50 per cent as a result. We're now heading towards being the illegal immigration capital of Europe.

""It's clear Starmer is incapable of stopping the boats and his backbenchers don't want him to. The country cannot go on like this - the situation in the Channel is a national security emergency.

""Those that arrive illegally from the safety of France must be swiftly deported so the message is clear: if you break into Britain, you will not get a life here.""

Donald Trump arrived in Scotland on Friday for a four-day visit, marking his first trip to Britain since winning re-election.

While officially deemed a ""private"" visit, the President utilised his Scottish hotel over the weekend to engage in trade talks with EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen.

""Later some people who were clearly at risk of being hurt were also escorted by vehicle away from the area for their safety.

He added people on social media need to ""comment responsibly"" because they can have ""real world consequences to the communities of Essex"".

Chief Constable Harrington said officers did take people away from the protest ""for their safety, for the safety of everyone there, because it was the best operational thing to do to prevent violence, to defuse the situation, we drove them away from a violent confrontation"".

He also insisted his officers ""are being absolutely impartial, policing according to the law and making sure we enforce the law and try to protect communities"".

The staff purportedly stumbled upon the duo during a standard check, according to reports.

‌



They are said to have found a ""whole set-up"", complete with a camera mounted on a tripod at the foot of the bed and an array of sex toys.

It is understood that the only repercussion for the male involved was his relocation to another facility.

112,210,"‘The place is empty, a lot have left’: Ballymena weighs up impact of anti-migrant riots",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/19/ballymena-impact-anti-migrant-riots-northern-ireland,2025-07-19T13:00:21Z,The Guardian,GB,migrant,"Since Ballymena erupted in three nights of anti-migrant riots last month, tranquility has returned to the County Antrim town. The rioters, after all, got what they wanted. They won.

Dozens of Romanian and Bulgarian Roma families that fled have not returned and those that remain keep a low profile – they do not linger on the streets and are scarcely visible.

The mobs who smashed windows, burned houses and battled police in order to expel Roma – and some other foreigners – from this corner of Northern Ireland see it as a victory.

“That’s them away back home. Everybody is relieved,” said Leanne Williamson, 42, who witnessed, and endorsed, the unrest. “It was madness but it was long overdue. The Romanians were ignorant and cheeky. Everyone now is at peace.”

In the main flashpoint – Clonavon Terrace and adjoining streets – houses that were torched remain gutted and boarded up. Of the Roma families who inhabited them there is no sign. There are no official figures but one informed source with ties to the community estimated that of the approximate pre-riot population of 1,200, two-thirds are gone – or, to use a loaded term, ethnically cleansed.

“The place is empty, a lot have left,” said Kirsty, 35, a Clonavon Road resident who withheld her surname. She did not miss her former neighbours, or what she said had been a transient flux. “You didn’t know who was coming and going. Now it’s a lot calmer. You can let your weans [children] out on the street a bit further.” Did the riots achieve their goal? “Yes.”

Another local person, who did not want his name published and did not endorse the riots, said the aftermath was striking. “Ballymena was like a whole new town, there was an amazing atmosphere. It was like something out of a movie where the bad gang has been kicked out and people come out to celebrate.”

The sentiment this week felt closer to quiet satisfaction, not jubilation, but it was still a counterpoint to the condemnation last month – from Keir Starmer and politicians across Northern Ireland – of mayhem that left dozens of police officers injured. The Police Federation likened the outbreak to an attempted pogrom. Violence abated as quickly as it started and apart from reports of prosecutions the story disappeared from headlines.

Plenty in Ballymena, a largely working-class Protestant town 25 miles north of Belfast, feel shame at what happened. “They were wrecking places and causing harm to people,” said Padraig, a teenager. “It was racist,” said his friend Robert. “I don’t think it was the right thing to do.”

Their reluctance to be fully identified reflected the fact that for others in Ballymena, it was mission accomplished.

Filipinos and people from central and eastern Europe, drawn by factory work, have increased in number in the past decade, mostly without incident, but the Roma people were singled out for allegations of antisocial behaviour and criminality. An alleged sexual assault on a teenage girl by two 14-year-old boys, who appeared in court with a Romanian interpreter, triggered the riots. A third suspect fled to Romania.

“Where are the foreigners?” the mob shouted during a free-for-all against anyone deemed non-local – a scene that echoed anti-immigrant riots in Belfast and England last summer, and fuelled warnings that the UK is a “powder keg” of social tension.

However, rioters and sympathisers later apologised to non-Roma families who were “accidentally” targeted. Posters that declared “Filipino lives here”, and loyalist bunting, sprouted on doors and windows to deflect attack.

In a sign of reduced tension the stickers have gone and Filipinos said they felt safe. “We are staying, we are OK. Our dreams will not stop with the trauma,” said Karen Estrella, 35, a care home worker. Posters that declare “Locals live here” have also dwindled.

Fero, a 45-year-old from Slovakia, said he liked Ballymena and blamed the riots on misbehaviour by Roma and Bulgarians. “I’m happy with what happened. Now they’re gone.”

Authorities are unable to say how many people fled or have since returned, and appear reluctant to comment on the riots’ aftermath. Ballymena’s mayor, deputy mayor, constituency MP and several other public representatives declined or did not respond to interview requests.

The Department for Communities referred questions about the vanished Roma to the Housing Executive, which said it did not hold such information but that 74 households – not necessarily Roma – sought assistance during the disorder. Of these households, 21 were placed in temporary accommodation and others made their own arrangements, said a spokesperson.

Critics have accused unionist parties of turning a blind eye to racism – such as a loyalist bonfire in County Tyrone that burned an effigy of migrants – to avoid losing votes. In Ballymena reticence extends to some civic society organisations that declined to be interviewed or quoted.

A paradox underpins the vigilantism. Some local people accuse the Roma of peddling cannabis and vapes, and credit paramilitaries with leading the expulsions, yet they acknowledge that paramilitaries sell drugs. “Aye,” said one, with a shrug. “That’s it.”

113,210,DeSantis under fire for using disaster funds to build migrant detention jail,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/17/ron-desantis-disaster-funds-alligator-alcatraz,2025-07-17T18:42:00Z,The Guardian,GB,migrant,"Officials in Florida diverted crucial disaster preparedness and response resources to support the hasty construction of the so-called Alligator Alcatraz migrant detention jail by the Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, a newly published report has claimed.

Some of the $20m in contracts analyzed by Talking Points Memo (TPM) before they inexplicably disappeared from the Florida department of financial services website went to donors or political allies of DeSantis, the report said.

Most of the money went to companies providing construction services, communications equipment to be used by jail staff, and security enhancements, according to TPM.

In a separate development on Thursday, it was disclosed that a 15-year-old boy was detained and held at the controversial remote Everglades jail for several days earlier this month, despite the insistence of state and federal authorities that only adults were housed there.

DeSantis’s alleged raid on resources intended for disaster response has prompted fury from Florida Democrats, who say creating a deficit as the Atlantic hurricane season approaches its peak is the height of irresponsibility.

“DeSantis already operates under a cloud of corruption when it comes to stealing taxpayer dollars,” said Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who toured the remote Everglades detention center on Saturday with other Democratic lawmakers, and declared conditions there “inhumane”.

“It’s no surprise he’d siphon off and create shortfalls in our hurricane preparedness funds for this boondoggle, then hide it from the public, or that he’d hand out sweetheart contracts to donors to build this monument to cruelty and denied due process.”

DeSantis has said the jail was set up, and will be operated, using $450m in taxpayers’ money he expects to be refunded by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema). Yet in the government’s response to a lawsuit filed by environmental groups seeking to close the controversial camp, Trump administration officials have attempted to distance themselves from the project.

TPM identified $19,983,785.03 in more than a dozen contracts that the state was invoiced for, or paid, from nine separate vendors. Some charged additional “rush fees” for supplying their products, reflecting the DeSantis administration’s urgency to get the camp up and running in time for Donald Trump’s visit on 1 July.

At least one of the documents confirmed that resources allocated for Florida’s “disaster preparedness” apparatus were diverted to the jail, TPM said, and that all had come from the executive office of the governor and were marked “procurement per executive order”.

The largest contract was for $11,903,977.18 to a company called Meridian Rapid Defense Group LLC, a provider of vehicle barriers that were used at DeSantis’s 2023 inauguration.

The company’s chief executive, Peter Whitford, told TPM he did not know if the 100 barrier sets ordered were destined for Alligator Alcatraz.

“What they do with that product is not part of our purview,” he said.

Previous reporting by the Miami Herald revealed that at least three vendors who won Alligator Alcatraz contracts had made financial donations to DeSantis or the Florida Republican party. TPM identified a fourth, a company called WeatherSTEM Inc, whose founder Ed Mansouri gave $3,000 to DeSantis in 2021.

Mansouri, whose company received a $24,740 contract for two lightning detectors, charged a $750 rush fee on each unit, the documents show. Mansouri told TPM: “My admiration for Governor DeSantis has nothing to do with my business.”

According to the report, copies of all of the contracts were originally posted to the Florida accountability contract tracking system on the website of the state’s department of financial services, but mysteriously disappeared during the course of TPM’s reporting.

None of the state entities contacted by the Guardian for comment responded.

Thursday’s revelation that an undocumented minor was sent to the jail, meanwhile, angered immigration advocates, who said it showed the chaotic nature of the state’s haste to populate it with detainees with no criminal record or active proceedings.

The Tampa Bay Times identified the child as a 15-year-old Mexican national named Alexis, who was riding with friends in a vehicle stopped in Tampa by the Florida highway patrol. Troopers handed over the group to the custody of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency, who sent them to the Everglades facility on the day it opened.

Alexis’s father told the newspaper he did not know where his son was for several days until he received a call from the camp. The Times said Alexis was now at a federal shelter for migrant children.

In an email to the newspaper, Stephanie Hartman, spokesperson for the Florida emergency management division that operates the jail, said Alexis had lied about his age.

An alliance of environmental groups, immigration advocates, Native American tribes and Democratic politicians has formed in opposition to the jail. A Move On petition calling for its closure had recorded almost 45,000 signatures by Thursday.

“This place needs to be shut the hell down,” Wasserman Schultz said.

“This internment camp is an outrageously wasteful publicity stunt, designed to hurt immigrants and distract from reckless Republican policies.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

Clashes between far-right groups, local residents and migrants broke out over the weekend, with multiple people reportedly injured.

‌



Five individuals were said to be hurt after a second night of anti-migrant unrest occurred in Torre Pacheco in south-east Spain late in the evening on Saturday, July 12, local authorities told Reuters.

‌



Police patrols have been ongoing in the area, but groups holding batons were allegedly seen walking through the streets looking for people with 'foreign origins,' the Guardian said local paper La Opinión de Murcia reported.

‌



One person was reportedly arrested during the incident, with the ongoing issues said to be some of the worst the country has seen in decades.

On Sunday, July 13, the town was quieter, but sources from the government told Reuters more arrests are expected in the coming days.

‌



Clips of men marching through the streets in clothes said to include far-right symbols were uploaded to social media, alongside videos of migrants holding Moroccan flags.

In the footage the groups could be seen throwing objects at each other during the clashes, which came after a pensioner was reportedly beaten up last Wednesday, July 9.

The 68-year-old pensioner was allegedly beaten up in the town as anti-migrant clashes break out in the region. He told local media he was beaten up by three 'young people of North African origin,' the Guardian said.

‌



A social media clip caught the attack on camera, with tensions spiralling out of control after the incident. It has been reported he is now recovering at home after the incident.

The motive for the attack is still unclear, with no arrests yet carried out, according to Reuters.

Mariola Guevara, Spain's central government's representative in the area, said the incident was being investigated, during a TV interview, adding she denounced ""hate speech,"" and ""incitement to violence,"" as far-right groups advance into the town.

The official said more Guardia Civil officers would also be instructed to patrol the area, in a bid to stop the violence.

Despite a major police presence, groups armed with batons roamed the streets looking for people with foreign origins, the regional newspaper La Opinión de Murcia reported.

The regional government did not say how many people were injured but stated that at least one person had been arrested over the violence.

The unrest erupted after a 68-year-old man told Spanish media he was attacked in the street on Wednesday by three young people, who he believed to be of north African origin. One of the three had beaten him up, another had shouted at him and the third, he believed, had filmed the attack on a phone, he reportedly told police.

Police sources told La Opinión de Murcia that they were investigating whether the alleged attack had been filmed and put on social media.

A video, said to be of the alleged attack, circulated widely online, fuelling tensions. Factchecking by several Spanish media later revealed that the images were not related to the one that reportedly took place in Murcia.

The Murcia town hall organised a demonstration on Friday that was intended to be peaceful but where far-right elements shouted anti-migrant slogans. One group called Deport Them Now posted a message on social media calling for attacks against people of north African origin.

Spanish authorities launched an appeal for calm on Sunday in the town of 36,000 people.

The conservative head of the Murcian regional government, Fernando López Miras, said in a post on X: “Torre Pacheco must get back to normal. I understand the frustration but nothing justifies violence.”

The Torre Pacheco mayor, Pedro Angel Roca Ternel, told RTVE public television: “I call on residents to be calm, for tranquillity.”

""Meera"", whose name we have changed to protect her identity, said she witnessed an elderly male resident being punched several times in the back by a carer at the home where she worked.

Sky News is unable to name the care home for legal reasons because of the ongoing police investigation.

""I was [a] whistleblower there,"" said Meera, who came to the UK from India last year to work at the home.

""Instead of addressing things, they fired me... I told them everything and they made me feel like I am criminal. I am not criminal, I am saving lives,"" she added.

Image: 'Meera' spoke up about abuse she said she witnessed in the care home where she worked

Like thousands of foreign care workers, Meera's employer sponsored her visa. Unless she can find another sponsor, she now faces the prospect of removal from the country.

""I am in trouble right now and no one is trying to help me,"" she said.

Meera said she reported the alleged abuse to her bosses, but was called to a meeting with a manager and told to ""change your statement, otherwise we will dismiss you"".

She refused. The following month, she was sacked.

The care home claimed she failed to perform to the required standard in the job.

She went to the police to report the alleged abuse and since then, a number of people from the care home have been arrested. They remain under investigation.

'Migrants recruited because many are too afraid to speak out'

The home has capacity for over 60 residents. It is unclear if the care home residents or their relatives know about the police investigation or claim of physical abuse.

Since the arrests, the regulator, the Care Quality Commission (CQC), carried out an investigation at the home triggered by the concerns - but the home retained its 'good' rating.

Meera has had no reassurance from the authorities that she will be allowed to remain in Britain.

Be the first to get Breaking News Install the Sky News app for free

In order to stay, she'll need to find another care home to sponsor her which she believes will be impossible without references from her previous employer.

She warned families: ""I just want to know people in care homes like these... your person, your father, your parents, is not safe.""

She claimed some care homes have preferred to recruit migrants because many are too afraid to speak out.

""You hire local staff, they know the legal rights,"" she said. ""They can complain, they can work anywhere... they can raise [their] voice,"" she said.

Currently migrants make up around a third of the adult social care workforce, with the majority here on visas that are sponsored by their employers.

As part of measures announced in April in the government's immigration white paper, the care visa route will be closed, meaning care homes will no longer be able to recruit abroad.

'Whole system is based on power imbalance'

But the chief executive of the Work Rights Centre, a charity that helps migrants with employment issues, is warning that little will change for the tens of thousands of foreign care workers already here.

""The whole system is based on power imbalance and the government announcement doesn't change that,"" Dr Dora-Olivia Vicol told Sky News.

She linked the conditions for workers to poor care for residents.

""I think the power that employers have over migrant workers' visas really makes a terrible contribution to the quality of care,"" she said.

Imran agrees. He came to the UK from Bangladesh, sponsored by a care company unrelated to the one Meera worked for. He says he frequently had to work 14-hour shifts with no break because there weren't enough staff. He too believes vulnerable people are being put at risk by the working conditions of their carers.

Migrant workers 'threatened' over visas

""For four clients, there is [a] minimum requirement for two or three staff. I was doing [it] alone,"" he said, in broken English.

""When I try to speak, they just directly threaten me about my visa,"" he said.

""I knew two or three of my colleagues, they are facing the same issue like me. But they're still afraid to speak up because of the visa.""

A government spokesperson called what happened to Imran and Meera ""shocking"".

""No one should go to work in fear of their employer, and all employees have a right to speak up if they witness poor practice and care.""

James Bullion, from the CQC, told Sky News it acts on intelligence passed to it to ensure people stay safe in care settings.

13,37,ICE arrests 11 Iranian nationals in 48 hours,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-arrests-11-iranian-nationals-48-hours/,2025-06-24T23:08:00Z,CBS News,US,immigration,"In its latest crackdown against illegal immigration, federal agents arrested 11 Iranian foreign nationals in 48 hours, including one watchlisted individual — part of a series of targeted operations spanning eight states and nine cities nationwide.

Among those arrested by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement since Sunday, June 22, is Mehran Makari Saheli, at his home near St. Paul, Minnesota. ICE officials say Saheli is a former member of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), an elite branch of Iran's armed forces. They said the detainee has ""admitted connections to Hezbollah,"" a U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organization backed by Iran.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers arrested Mehran Makari Saheli, an Iranian national, at his home in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 22, 2025. Department of Homeland Security

ICE said that five of those arrested possessed previous criminal convictions ranging from grand larceny to drug and firearm possessions.

The Department of Homeland Security says Yousef Mehridehno had been living in America illegally for nearly 8 years when federal authorities determined he lied on a visa application. Roughly four months after the Iranian foreign national was added to the U.S. known or suspected terrorist list in February, he was apprehended by federal agents Sunday in central Mississippi, just outside of Jackson.

Officials have not linked these arrests to any specific terrorism plots and the Department of Homeland Security has stated that there are no current, credible threats to the U.S. homeland, despite a heightened security environment following U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites over the weekend.

But all 11 Iranians have been charged or accused of crimes beyond civil immigration violations, according to ICE officials, who say the arrested men represent a threat to public safety.

While arresting Ribvar Karmi in northern Alabama on Sunday, the Department of Homeland Security says federal agents found an Islamic Republic of Iran Army identification card on his person. According to ICE officials, Karimi purportedly served as an Iranian Army sniper from 2018 to 2021 and entered the U.S. in October 2024 on a K-1 visa, reserved for migrants engaged to be married to American citizens. Karmi is now detained in ICE custody, where officials say he will remain pending removal proceedings.

In Colorado Springs on Sunday, ICE officials arrested Mahmoud Shafiei and Mehrdad Mehdipour, Iranian nationals who were living at the same home and who both had orders of removal against them. ICE said Shafiei has a criminal history that includes state and federal convictions for drug crimes and arrests for assault and child abuse.

In addition to the 11 Iranian nationals who were arrested, federal agents have also arrested U.S. citizen Linet Vartaniann, who was taken into custody on federal charges of threatening a law enforcement officer and harboring an illegal alien. ICE officials contend the woman threatened to open fire if immigration enforcement officers entered her home. According to ICE, the defendant threatened federal agents during an encounter on Sunday, warning she would go outside and ""shoot officers in the head.""

ICE officials tell CBS News that the arrests since Sunday are part of the Trump administration's latest crackdown on illegal immigration. Federal officials have aimed to dramatically ramp up immigration arrests, with average daily arrests climbing from 660 in President Trump's first 100 days to 1,200 in June — and the White House says its target is 3,000 arrests per day.

""We have been saying we are getting the worst of the worst out — and we are,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement to CBS News. ""We don't wait until a military operation to execute; we proactively deliver on President Trump's mandate to secure the homeland.""

According to U.S. government data, last fiscal year, 68 Iranian foreign nationals were arrested by ICE — including 47 with criminal convictions. ICE arrested some 113,000 people in total over that period, most of whom were from Mexico or Central America.

This weekend, the Department of Homeland Security activated its National Terrorism Advisory System just hours after the United States' attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities. The strikes came after a days-long Israeli campaign against Iran, resulting in Iranian attacks on Israel — though Mr. Trump said Monday the two sides had agreed to a ceasefire.

Current and former intelligence officials caution that America is on high alert for physical or cyber retaliation, telling CBS News that there is a growing concern about the potential for homegrown extremism, including lone attacks inspired by Iranian calls to violence.

On Monday, DHS Secretary Kristi Noem told reporters that homeland security officials are trying to ""get in front of"" threats to the U.S. by ""working with our local governors and law enforcement to make sure that they recognize potential threats or suspicious activities.""

Probed on reports of potential Hezbollah sleeper cells, the secretary said only that the U.S. has seen ""some [that have] gone overseas for a short period of time, become radicalized and come back."" She added, ""We have to watch for all of it, and to be diligent on all of it, and we'll continue to do so.""",GNews,-3.03,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.88,"cbs news, CBS, CBS News, cbsnews.com, cbsnews",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/,https://ground.news/interest/cbs-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,CBS Corporation,1927,-1.5,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,cbsnews.com,,cbs news,21,USA,Y,G,CBS News,Y
120,37,"Immigrant kids detained in ""unsafe and unsanitary"" sites as Trump administration seeks to end protections",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigrant-kids-detained-conditions-trump-administration-end-protections/,2025-07-28T09:00:00Z,CBS News,US,migrant,"A child developed a rash after he was prevented from changing his underwear for four days. A little boy, bored and overcome with despair, began hitting himself in the head. A child with autism and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder was forced to go without his medication, despite his mother's pleas.

""I heard one officer say about us 'they smell like sh--,'"" one detained person recounted in a federal court filing. ""And another officer responded, 'They are sh--.'""

Attorneys for immigrant children collected these stories, and more, from youth and families detained in what they called ""prison-like"" settings across the U.S. from March through June, even as the Trump administration has requested a federal district court judge terminate existing protections that mandate basic rights and services — including safe and sanitary conditions — for children held by the government.

The administration argues that the protections mandated under what is known as the Flores Settlement Agreement encourage immigration and interfere with its ability to establish immigration policy. U.S. District Court Judge Dolly Gee, who is in California, is expected to issue a ruling on the request after an Aug. 8 hearing.

With the Flores agreement in place, children are being held in ""unsafe and unsanitary"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities such as tents, airports, and offices for up to several weeks despite the agency's written policy saying people generally should not be held in its custody longer than 72 hours, according to the June court filing from immigrants' attorneys. In addition to opposing the U.S. Department of Justice's May request to terminate the Flores consent decree, the attorneys demanded more monitoring for children in immigration detention.

""The biggest fear is that without Flores, we will lose a crucial line of transparency and accountability,"" said Sergio Perez, executive director of the California-based Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law. ""Then you have a perfect storm for the abuse of individuals, the violation of their rights, and the kind of treatment that this country doesn't stand for.""

The Flores agreement has set minimum standards and oversight for detained immigrant children since 1997, when it brought an end to a decade-long lawsuit filed on behalf of unaccompanied immigrant minors who had been subjected to poor treatment in unsafe and unsanitary conditions without access to medical care. It is named for Jenny Lisette Flores, a 15-year-old from El Salvador who was taken into U.S. custody in the mid-1980s, subjected to strip searches, and housed alongside unrelated men.

The agreement established national standards for the protection of immigrant children detained by federal authorities, with requirements for safe and sanitary detention facilities, access to clean water, appropriate food, clothing, bedding, recreational and educational opportunities, sanitation, plus appropriate medical and mental health care. Children in immigrant detention range from infants to teens.

In 2015, Gee ruled that the agreement includes children accompanied by adults.

The Justice Department and the Department of Homeland Security, which includes both the Customs and Border Protection agency and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, declined to answer questions about the administration's intent to end the Flores agreement or about the conditions in which kids are detained. In a May court filing, government attorneys argued, among other points, that the agreement improperly directs immigration decisions to the courts, not the White House. U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi also has said that the Flores agreement has ""incentivized illegal immigration,"" and that Congress and federal agencies have resolved the problems Flores was designed to fix.

ICE detention facilities have the ""highest standards,"" Abigail Jackson, a White House spokesperson, said in an email to KFF Health News. ""They are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings.""

Immigration lawyers and researchers have pushed back on the idea that the Flores agreement encourages migration, arguing that the conditions in people's homelands are driving them to move.

President Trump is not the first president to seek to modify, or end, the agreement.

In 2016, President Barack Obama's administration unsuccessfully sought to exempt accompanied minors from the Flores agreement, arguing that an influx of immigrants from Central America had overwhelmed the system.

In 2019, following a policy that caused family separation, the first Trump administration announced it would replace Flores with new regulations to expand family detention and eliminate detention time limits. The courts rejected that plan, too.

In 2024, President Joe Biden's administration successfully requested to remove the Department of Health and Human Services from the agreement after the Office of Refugee Resettlement incorporated some Flores standards into agency regulations.

Allegations of unsafe conditions under the agreement also predate this latest immigration crackdown under Mr. Trump. One court filing from 2019 said that attorneys visiting two Texas detention centers found at least 250 infants, children, and teens, some of whom had been held at the facility for nearly a month. ""Children were filthy and wearing clothes covered in bodily fluids, including urine,"" the filing said.

Seven children are known to have died while in federal custody from 2018 to 2019, according to media reports.

And in 2023, 8-year-old Anadith Danay Reyes Alvarez became sick and died while in Customs and Border Protection custody in Texas for nine days. Her parents had turned over medical records detailing the girl's medical history, including diagnoses of sickle cell disease and congenital heart disease, upon their detention. Yet her mother's repeated pleas for emergency medical care were ignored.

Her family filed a wrongful death claim in May.

Advocates attributed the deaths partly to prolonged detention in increasingly crowded facilities and delayed medical care. Officials have said they increased medical services and acknowledged failures in the wake of the deaths.

But with the Trump administration's unprecedented push to detain and deport migrants — including families — the threat to the health of children caught up in those sweeps is alarming child advocates.

""Very rarely do you have spikes in populations of detained folk that you don't see a drastic decrease in the quality of their medical care,"" said Daniel Hatoum, a senior supervising attorney at the Texas Civil Rights Project, one of the groups that filed the wrongful death claim for Anadith's family.

Recent reports from court-appointed monitors cite continued lack of access to appropriate medical care; temperature extremes; few outside recreational opportunities; lack of appropriate food and clothing; and an inability to dim lights to sleep.

Terminating the Flores agreement would remove all outside oversight of immigration detention facilities by court-ordered monitors and attorneys. The public would have to depend on the government for transparency about the conditions in which children are held.

""Our system requires that there be some oversight for government, not just the Department of Homeland Security, but in general,"" Hatoum said. ""We know that. So, I do not believe that DHS could police itself.""

In the months after Mr. Trump took office and the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency began cuts, the administration shuttered DHS' Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman, and the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which were intended to add a layer of oversight. After a lawsuit, the Trump administration reversed action and noted the offices would remain open, but it is unclear how those offices have been affected by shifts in policy and cuts in staffing.

Leecia Welch, an attorney with the legal advocacy group Children's Rights, said the Flores agreement itself, or efforts to hold the government responsible for abiding by its requirements, are not rooted in partisan politics. She said she raised concerns about conditions during Biden's administration, too.

""These are not political issues for me,"" Welch said. ""How does our country want to treat children? That's it. It's very simple. I'm not going to take it easy on any administration where children are being harmed in their care.""

46,37,"Some Afrikaners say Trump is being lied to about a ""White genocide"" in South Africa: ""It's not happening""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/afrikaners-react-trump-white-genocide-south-africa/,2025-05-22T01:04:30Z,CBS News,US,refugee,"Refugee admissions to the United States have all but ground to a halt — except for one group, or a ""small subset,"" as Secretary of State Marco Rubio called them on Tuesday: Afrikaners. They are members of the White ethnic minority that once led South Africa's brutal, four-decade apartheid regime, which ended in 1994 with the election of Nelson Mandela as president.

The Trump administration has already welcomed the first group of Afrikaner asylum applicants, who were given expedited refugee status after claiming they were the victims of violence and discrimination in South Africa.

Other Afrikaners are waiting, keen to take advantage of the offer of special treatment from the Trump administration to gain protected status and the right to live and work in the U.S.

Those hopefuls have been meeting to share information on the process, including Dolf Grobler, who has already applied. The professional hunter told CBS News he has $2.5 million to help make America great again.

""I'm worried that the genocide, which is currently mainly focused on White farmers, is going to spread,"" he said. The claim of a White genocide is one that President Trump's adviser Elon Musk, whose family are Afrikaners, has backed.

Musk joined Mr. Trump at the White House on Wednesday as the U.S. leader hosted South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa for an official visit. The Afrikaner refugee program was a topic of discussion, along with trade and other matters. In the Oval Office meeting, Ramaphosa pushed back against Mr. Trump's repeated claims of Whites being targeted.

""Those people in many cases, are being executed, being executed, and they happen to be White, and most happen to be farmers,"" Mr. Trump said, calling the situation ""sort of the opposite of apartheid.""

""People who do get killed, unfortunately, through criminal activity, are not only White people. Majority of them are Black people,"" Ramaphosa said.

According to South African police, in the last three months of 2024, 12 people were murdered on farms there; one was a White farmer, while the others were Black laborers or security workers. Asked if he believed life for him and his family was better under apartheid — an overtly racist minority-rule system that denied equal rights to South Africa's vast majority Black population — Grobler didn't hesitate.

""Yes,"" he told CBS News. ""I can't say in my heart that we are better off now."" Although he did concede apartheid was wrong.

Claims of a White genocide are often circulated by right-wing groups, but the view is not held widely within the Afrikaner community.

Afrikaner commentator Piet Croucamp, an academic at North-West University in South Africa, says the claims are simply untrue.

""There's no sign of it, never has been. In fact, Whites are economically the strongest group"" in South Africa, Croucamp told CBS News. ""64% of all boardrooms in South Africa are still White. The average incomes of White South Africans are vastly higher than Black South Africans ... they have better schools, they have better education, private health care. This is the land of milk and honey if you're White.""

Croucamp suspects the South African government's strong stance against Israel's actions in Gaza, and its relations with China, could have played some part in Mr. Trump's decision to embrace the controversial amnesty program for Afrikaners, but he believes there's more to it.

""In South Africa, right-wing groups, so-called civil society groups, we know that they have access to the Trump administration because they claim that. And just over the last few days, they have, several times, they said that they will speak to the American government, as if they have access to them. And if you listen to what Trump has said, it corresponds exactly with the genocide narrative that they sell and that they market,"" Croucamp said. ""So, I'm afraid I have to believe them when they say they have direct access to the Trump administration, and we see what Trump has been doing.""

Grilled about the refugee program Tuesday on Capitol Hill, in a testy exchange with Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, Secretary of State Rubio insisted that U.S. foreign policy ""doesn't require even-handedness, it involves prioritizing the interests of the United States. ... The United States has a right to pick and choose who they allow into the United States.""

White South Africans make up only about 7% of the country's population, but they still own more than half of all its farmland. And while the country has a staggeringly high crime rate, racial motives are not generally a factor, according to Afrikaner cattle farmer Nick Serfontein.

He acknowledged that violent attacks on farmers do occur, especially in agricultural land near big cities, where there are often large, impoverished populations, but he said overall, ""I feel safe. I sleep with my doors open here on the farm.""

There have also been allegations that White farmers are the victims of land expropriation, with the government seizing farms without providing compensation. In January, Ramaphosa signed into law measures to expropriate mostly unused land for public use, which his government said was necessary to address the consequences of decades of apartheid. While the law provides for fair compensation in most cases, it also allows for expropriation without compensation under limited circumstances. And any measures can be challenged in court.

Mr. Trump has argued that it unfairly targets White landowners, though the law does not mention the race of anyone who could be affected under the legislation.

And more importantly, there hasn't been a single case of expropriation without compensation documented in the 31 years since apartheid ended.

Serfontein argues the problem isn't a deliberate effort by the government to seize White-owned land without compensation, but rather ""because of a dysfunctional government. The model is wrong.""

He said that for decades, land has been handed over to a Black population with compensation for former owners under established rules, but without any support for the new owners. So, almost a decade ago, Serfontein helped to launch a project aimed at training new Black farmers to work the land.

To date, he says he's personally helped train more than 700 young Black farmers — the country's next generation of agricultural workers.

""I'm extremely positive, and so are the young people, the young farmers, they are positive,"" he said.

As for a white genocide, he agreed with Croucamp, saying bluntly: ""It's not happening.""

Serfontein said he didn't know the histories of the Afrikaners who had already left for the U.S., and he didn't doubt they ""probably had some unhappy experiences in South Africa, about a number of things. But let me tell you that if you went to NAMPO last week — NAMPO is the biggest agricultural show in the Southern Hemisphere — you would have found a vibe there between the farmers, young farmers, old farmers, Black farmers, White farmers, that you've never experienced before. They are so excited about the future of South Africa.""

They want to farm in a country, Serfontein says, where most people understand that the land must be shared by both Black and White.",GNews,-3.03,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.88,"cbs news, CBS, CBS News, cbsnews.com, cbsnews",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/,https://ground.news/interest/cbs-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,CBS Corporation,1927,-1.5,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,cbsnews.com,,cbs news,21,USA,Y,G,CBS News,

'I don't think we need to apologise'

Torquay Town Hall (Image: Guy Henderson)

Providing a home in Torbay for an Afghan refugee family has unlocked government funds to help house local families in need.

‌



Torbay councillors have responded to social media criticism over plans to buy four new homes in the bay to help families facing homelessness.

‌



The government insists that one of the four homes - on new developments around the bay - must be offered to an Afghan family under a scheme which supports people who helped British forces during the war in Afghanistan. Their work with British forces now means their lives are at risk in their home country.

‌



The council has been criticised for not allocating all four of the homes to local families in light of figures which show a ‘notable increase’ in the number of people homeless in the bay, with 1,400 households being assessed in 2024/25.

More than 160 are currently in temporary accommodation, with demand increasing and places in short supply.

However, Cllr Adam Billings (Con, Churston with Galmpton) told a meeting of the cabinet: “There may be local families who wonder why the fourth house cannot be provided for them, but if it was not for that house (for an Afghan family) being provided in that way, we would not be getting the funds for the other three.

‌



“This was a package deal provided by the government. The important thing is that this is providing homes for four families, and three of them are local families.”

And council leader David Thomas (Con, Preston) said it was a great deal. “It’s almost a case of buy one, get three free!” he said.

Cllr Mike Fox (Lib Dem, Barton with Watcombe) added: “I don’t think we need to apologise for helping Afghan people who helped our soldiers during the war.” And Cllr Swithin Long (Lib Dem, Barton with Watcombe) added: “This is supporting people who supported our troops and put their lives on the line.”

Cllr Alan Tyerman (Con, Churston with Galmpton) said the council had applied for funds to buy 12 properties, but had only been allocated funds for four.

125,210,Austria deports man to Syria for first time in 15 years,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/03/austria-syria-deportation-assad-criminal-asylum,2025-07-03T16:52:02Z,The Guardian,GB,refugee,"Austria has returned a Syrian with a criminal conviction to his birth country in what it described as the first such deportation since the fall of the Assad regime.

“The deportation carried out today is part of a strict and thus fair asylum policy,” Austria’s interior minister, Gerhard Karner, said in a statement.

The ministry told AFP it was the first deportation of a Syrian directly to Syria in about 15 years.

The 32-year-old man, who was granted asylum in Austria in 2014, lost his refugee status in February 2019 because of his criminal record, his legal adviser Ruxandra Staicu said. She declined to specify the nature of his conviction.

The man received a negative decision on an asylum claim in April and had been awaiting a response on another decision.

Since the fall of the Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, several European governments have called for the return of Syrian refugees who fled to Europe after the crushing of rebellion and outbreak of civil war that drove 12 million people from their homes, including 6 million abroad.

Austria, which hosts 100,000 Syrians, called for the “orderly repatriation and deportation to Syria” of refugees the day after the dictator was ousted.

Separately, Germany’s interior minister, Alexander Dobrindt, revealed his government was seeking an agreement with Syria’s new Islamist government to deport criminals of Syrian nationality. Germany has given refuge to nearly one million Syrians since 2015.

Germany resumed flying convicted criminals of Afghan nationality to their home country in August, after pausing deportations following the Taliban’s takeover three years earlier.

Denmark’s prime minister, Mette Frederiksen, said on Thursday that migrants who commit serious crimes should be expelled from Europe, without making reference to any specific country. In a press conference to mark the start of Denmark’s six-month EU presidency, she described the current asylum system as “broken” with the consequences of “uncontrolled migration” visible in European societies.

Migrants “who commit serious crimes and do not respect our values and way of life – I don’t think they have a place in Europe. And they should be expelled.” She added: “We need new solutions that will lower the influx of migrants to Europe”.

Denmark revoked the residency status of some Syrians as early as 2021, when it deemed parts of the war-torn country safe to return to.

Nearly 10 years after the peak of the 2015-16 migration crisis, when 1.3 million people sought refuge in Europe, the EU has moved to tighten up its asylum and migration rules.

The European Commission also proposed faster procedures for returning people with no right to stay in the EU to their countries of origin, including the possibility of creating offshore “return hubs” outside Europe.

Speaking alongside the Danish prime minister, Ursula von der Leyen, the commission president, said she hoped to see progress on the returns proposals and another to create a common list of safe countries , which would allow fast-tracked asylum procedures – and potentially faster refusals, during Denmark’s six months of chairing EU council meetings.

In a joint statement this week, 52 rights groups, including Amnesty International and the Danish Refugee Council, said the proposals risked “seriously undermining people’s access to fair and full asylum procedures in Europe”. The groups also raised concerns about potential human rights violations in offshore return hubs.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

I just go forward and do my stuff,” said model-turned-fighter Islam Dulatov ahead of his UFC 318 debut against Adam Fugitt. Boasting a 12-1 record, the German sensation made a thunderous entry into the UFC, drawing comparisons to stars like Arman Tsarukyan and Ilia Topuria. Why? Well, he’s not just talented, he’s rich. Back in Germany, his family now owns multiple thriving businesses and ranks among the wealthiest in their area. But was it always this way? Not even close.

Recently, Dulatov has been criticized by many in the MMA world for being rich. Several individuals have claimed that he hasn’t faced the same struggles as other fighters who rose from nothing. However, Dulatov would beg to differ. In his conversation with Home of Fight, the model-turned-fighter lashed out at those who believe he was wealthy from the very beginning.

Talking about his family’s fortune, Dulatov stated that he and his family came to Germany as refugees to escape the harsh realities of the Chechen war, “A lot of people talk like I come from a rich, established family. No, my family was not rich, and I wasn’t born rich. I come from Chechnya — you know, everybody knows this.”

He further added, “That was not a casual war. We came to Germany as refugees. I don’t know which refugee comes to Germany, who is rich and all. So, I built myself — you know, I’m self-made. My family, my brothers — we are doing our businesses, you know. We built it up and made our parents rich, not the other way around. Our parents didn’t make us rich.”

AD

Being victims of the war, Dulatov and his family were forced to flee their country, Russia. The Second Chechen War made it impossible for them to stay and take care of their homeland. In search of a better life, the entire family migrated to Düsseldorf, Germany, as refugees in 2007. With nothing but a small amount of money, they arrived with hope, but through sheer hard work, they ensured they wouldn’t remain poor for long.

Recalling the ordeals they had to face in Germany, Dulatov’s elder brother, Djibril, himself a model and professional MMA fighter, stated, “It was a difficult decision. No one wants to leave their homeland or family.” After eight years of struggle, they were finally granted German citizenship. They also invested their money in various businesses, which ultimately made them wealthy. Well, with his modelling career going smoothly, Dulatov has a goal in the UFC: to fight for the title, and that too in his prime.

Islam Dulatov aims to take the welterweight gold soon

In his UFC debut, Islam Dulatov knocked out his opponent, Adam Fugitt, to earn a Performance of the Night bonus on the UFC 318 prelims. With a 100% finishing ratio, the German fighter has cemented himself as the next big face in the welterweight division. Talking about his performance at UFC 318, Dulatov stated, “I think it’s not comparable to reality, because it’s better than I ever had in my mind. Unbelievable feeling, really. I trained so hard for this, over 10 years of my life.”

When asked about his aspirations for his UFC career, Dulatov stated that he wants to take his career at his own pace, but he will fight for the title sooner than expected. “I’m going to be honest with you guys, I want to take my time for this. I grow up, I make big steps in each fight. Actually, it will take as long as it takes. I waited so long for this opportunity to fight in the UFC. Two years or something like that. It will not change anything. I want to fight for the title when I’m in my prime. We will get there soon.”

His victory at UFC 318 ensured that he made a name for himself in the welterweight division. However, with his modeling career on the sidelines, can he afford to take shots to the face?

127,195,What we know about claim Pope Leo XIV deployed priests to immigration courts,https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/07/23/pope-leo-priests-immigration-courts/,2025-07-25T14:00:03Z,Snopes.com,US,refugee,"In the weeks after Pope Leo XIV, formerly Cardinal Robert Francis Prevost, was elected in May 2025, a rumor spread on social media that he was sending priests to courthouses in solidarity with immigrants.

""Pope Leo is deploying priests to courthouses to stand in solidarity with immigrants as they exit their hearings — offering protection, support, and a watchful eye,"" one Threads post (archived) with the claim read. The post reached over 86,000 reactions, as of this writing.

(Threads user @creepyhorrorgal)

""Pope Leo XIV has called for priests, deacons and parish leaders to accompany migrants to court and stand in solidarity with them,"" an X post (archived) on the topic, with over 1.1 million views, read.

Similar claims spread on other social media platforms, including Bluesky, Facebook, Reddit, often featuring a letter attributed to the Diocese of San Diego.

In short, the rumors aren't exactly correct. According to local media reports, on June 20, 2025, World Refugee Day, about a dozen clergy did participate in both a special mass and a gathering outside the federal courthouse in San Diego, held in solidarity with migrants attending immigration hearings.

The letter circulating online allegedly came from Bishop-designate Michael Pham of the Diocese of San Diego, appointed by Pope Leo XIV earlier in 2025. In a letter dated June 11, 2025, Bishop Pham invited priests, deacons, and ministry leaders to join him at the federal courthouse on June 20.

We have not independently authenticated the letter, but it describes an event that did occur.

However, there was no evidence that Pope Leo XIV directly issued any instruction for this action, nor that he deployed priests in a broader, global or national context. No official Vatican communication references the courthouse action, and none of the outlets covering the San Diego event reported any involvement by the pope beyond having appointed Pham earlier that year.

We have reached out to the Holy See Press Office to clarify whether any formal directive was issued regarding the courthouse initiative and will update this report if we receive a response.

How the letter circulated online

It was unclear who first shared the aforementioned letter online. It seemingly first appeared in a June 11 article on the blog ""The Deacon's Bench,"" created by Deacon Greg Kandra, which stated the letter was circulated in the Diocese of San Diego.

Kandra confirmed via email he received the letter from an unnamed source and uploaded it to his website after checking, unsuccessfully, for an official copy on the Diocese of San Diego's site. He added that the event described in the letter went forward as planned and was attended by numerous clergy in support of migrants. In fact, while Snopes has not independently verified the letter, its content was consistent with an event that occurred later.

The next day, Rich Raho, theology teacher at the DePaul College Prep, shared the letter on his X and Bluesky profile, writing, ""Pope Leo's first US episcopal appointment, San Diego's Bishop-designate Pham, a Vietnamese refugee, invites priests and faith leaders to 'stand in solidarity' with migrants at courthouse on June 20, as they make court appearances.""

As of this writing the letter was also not available on the Diocese of San Diego's website, The Roman Catholic Diocese of SAN DIEGO Facebook page, or Pham's Facebook profile. We have reached out to the Diocese of San Diego for a confirmation and will update this report if we receive a response.

In the letter, Pham reportedly wrote that the presence of faith leaders ""makes a difference in how the migrants are treated,"" even if it does not change the legal outcome. ""Being present will be a good way for us to give witness and stand with immigrants on a day in which, across the Diocese, we will all celebrate a mass at our various parishes dedicated to our immigrant brothers and sisters,"" the letter ended.

What happened at the San Diego courthouse

The event described in the letter actually took place. According to local media reports, including NBC San Diego, ABC 10 News, and the Episcopal News Service, about a dozen clergy, including Bishop Pham, attended both the mass and courthouse gathering. The Associated Press also reported on the event.

On June 21, 2025, ABC 10 News shared a video titled, ""Religious leaders show solidarity during immigration hearings on National Refugee Day,"" featuring footage from the event and an interview with Bishop Pham. In the segment, Bishop Pham reflected on his own experience as a Vietnam War refugee and described the event as a moral act of solidarity.

""It gave me access to freedom that many countries in the world don't offer,"" he said of coming to the U.S.

""It is sad and disheartening to see these kinds of things playing out in our country today,"" he added. ""We must treat every person with dignity and respect."" According to the ABC 10 News report, Bishop Pham stated that he plans to attend more immigration hearings in the future.

Other rumors about Pope Leo XIV

Since the election of Pope Leo XIV, numerous rumors have circulated online about his past, statements and actions.

In mid-May 2025 we fact-checked whether he once said, ""You cannot follow both Christ and the cruelty of kings. A leader who mocks the weak, exalts himself, and preys on the innocent is not sent by God. He is sent to test you. And many are failing.""

64,37,Trump officials crafting rule to prevent asylum-seekers from getting work permits,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/asylum-seekers-work-permits-trump/,2025-06-03T21:14:02Z,CBS News,US,asylum,"Trump officials considering rule that would keep asylum-seekers from getting work permits

The Trump administration is considering a regulation that would prevent most asylum-seekers from getting work permits, potentially upending longstanding U.S. immigration policy, two Department of Homeland Security officials told CBS News.

A proposal by officials at U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would amount to an indefinite pause on the U.S. government's decades-old policy of allowing migrants with pending asylum claims to work in the country lawfully while their cases are decided, the DHS officials said, requesting anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.

The proposed changes — which have not been previously reported — would add yet another layer to President Trump's government-wide immigration crackdown, targeting a massively backlogged asylum system that his top aides have argued is being systematically exploited by economic migrants.

But a halt to work permits for asylum-seekers would also trigger concerns among advocates that it could prevent migrants from supporting themselves and their families, and drive them to work illegally in the underground economy.

Since the 1990s, U.S. law has allowed immigration officials to grant work permits to asylum applicants if their cases have been pending for at least 180 days. Generally speaking, that has allowed asylum applicants to request a work permit 150 days after they make their claim. Those eligible can be granted the permit after another 30 days.

But a regulation under internal consideration by the Trump administration would suspend the issuance of new work permits to asylum-seekers until USCIS decides all asylum claims within an average of 180 days, the DHS officials said.

That timeframe would be exceedingly difficult to meet in the near future, given massive case backlogs and operational constraints. Last year, for example, a federal government watchdog found that over 77% of the asylum applications before USCIS had been pending for beyond 180 days. Nearly 40% of applications remained unresolved after two years.

Even if the 180-day processing average is reached, the proposal would require asylum-seekers to wait one year until after they file their application — instead of six months — to be eligible for a work permit, the DHS officials said.

It's unclear when the regulation may be publicly announced, or if it will be altered before being finalized.

In a statement to CBS News, the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees USCIS, said it does not comment on the ""deliberative process or possible decision making.""

""Over the previous four years, the Biden administration eviscerated the integrity of America's asylum system. The Department is exploring all possible options to protect our national security and increase program integrity,"" DHS said in its statement. ""DHS is working to mitigate all forms of fraud and abuse.""

The changes under consideration by the Trump administration would apply to asylum seekers with pending applications sent to USCIS and those in deportation proceedings before the immigration courts, which are overseen by the Justice Department.

Asylum can be granted to foreigners on U.S. soil who prove they are fleeing persecution due to their nationality, race, religion, political views or membership in a social group. While factors like nationality and legal representation play a key role, many applicants do not ultimately meet the high legal threshold to win asylum, government figures show.

Still, over the past decade, amid record arrivals of migrants at the U.S.-Mexico border, the number of asylum applications has ballooned. USCIS is overseeing roughly 1.5 million asylum applications, while the immigration courts are reviewing another 2 million, according to government data.

The plan under consideration would seek to eliminate what Trump administration officials have described as a magnet for migrants using the asylum system simply to work in the U.S. It echoes a 2020 rule issued by the first Trump administration that sought to increase the waiting period for asylum applicants requesting work authorization from six months to a year and impose other restrictions on eligibility for work permits.

The proposed rule would also be the latest step taken by the second Trump administration to make the U.S. inhospitable for asylum-seekers.

Immediately after returning to the White House in January, President Trump all but closed the U.S. asylum system, giving border agents the power to summarily deport most migrants on the grounds the country is facing an ""invasion."" That emergency order is being challenged by pro-immigrant advocates, who say it ignores American asylum law.

Conchita Cruz, the co-executive director of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project, a group that supports those with asylum claims, said efforts to curtail work permits for the migrants she serves would hurt U.S. communities and employers.

""Asylum seekers are playing critical roles in a wide array of jobs — they are the doctors and the people cleaning the hospitals,"" Cruz said.",GNews,-3.03,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.88,"cbs news, CBS, CBS News, cbsnews.com, cbsnews",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/,https://ground.news/interest/cbs-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,CBS Corporation,1927,-1.5,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,cbsnews.com,,cbs news,21,USA,Y,G,CBS News,Y
129,201,A United Nations research institute created an AI refugee avatar,https://techcrunch.com/2025/07/12/a-united-nations-research-institute-created-an-ai-refugee-avatar/,2025-07-12T21:03:39Z,TechCrunch,US,refugee,"In Brief

A research institute connected to the United Nations has created two AI-powered avatars designed to teach people about refugee issues.

404 Media wrote about an experiment conducted by a class at the United Nations University Center for Policy Research (UNU-CPR) that resulted in the creation of two AI agents or avatars — Amina, a fictional woman who fled Sudan and is living in a refugee camp in Chad, and Abdalla, a fictional soldier with the Rapid Support Forces, a paramilitary force in Sudan.

Users are supposed to be able to talk to Amina and Abdalla on the experiment’s website, though I received an error message when I tried to register on Saturday afternoon.

Eduardo Albrecht, a Columbia professor and a senior fellow at the UNU-CPR, told 404 Media that he and his students were “just playing around with the concept” and not proposing this as a solution for the UN.

A paper summarizing this work suggested that these avatars could eventually be used “to quickly make a case to donors.” However, it also noted that many workshop attendees who interacted with the agents responded negatively, for example saying that refugees “are very capable of speaking for themselves in real life.”",GNews,-0.47,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/techcrunch-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,45.3,"techcrunch, TechCrunch.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/techcrunch/,https://ground.news/interest/techcrunch,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/techcrunch-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER,HIGH,USA,,Website,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,Verizon Media,2005,,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,techcrunch.com,,techcrunch,8,USA,,,,
130,256,"Sex, Lies and Nordic Privilege: Norway’s Nina Knag and Pia Tjelta Reveal Uncomfortable Truths About the Refugee Crisis in ‘Don’t Call Me Mama’",https://variety.com/2025/film/global/nina-knag-pia-tjelta-dont-call-me-mama-1236450560/,2025-07-09T18:52:09Z,Variety,US,refugee,"Norwegian director Nina Knag exposes dirty secrets in “Don’t Call Me Mama,” premiering at Karlovy Vary Film Festival.

“I was doing research for another project about immigration in Norway, and I came across this article about Norwegian women volunteering at asylum centers. It was revealed that some of them were having sexual relationships with young Syrian men. I was shocked by this power imbalance,” she reveals.

“At first, I judged them. I pitied them, too. And then I put myself in their shoes. When you’re in your late 40s, your marriage is stagnant and your children have just moved out, you don’t feel seen. And then this young person makes you feel alive once again.”

Popular on Variety

In “Don’t Call Me Mama,” well-liked teacher Eva (Pia Tjelta) is struggling. Her husband, the local mayor, has betrayed and humiliated her, but she still tries to support his campaign. Their child has moved out, their sex life is dead. When she meets 18-year-old refugee Amir, she wants to help him. Then she just wants him.

“He awakens her sexuality,” says Knag.

“At a certain point in a marriage, you forget about intimacy, you’re busy with kids and the passion is gone. Eva used to love her husband. She still does, I think – they just lost their connection. Amir lights a fire in her, but it makes you wonder: Are they just using him to find that spark again?”

Embarking on an affair, Eva – who’s always followed the rules – has a lot to lose: her position, respect in the community, friends and even her philandering husband. But not as much as Amir, who’s fighting for his future.

“For him, it’s a question of life and death. He’s attracted to her, but all these feelings and longings are mixed with privilege. She has power over him, that’s undeniable, and she’s not really thinking about it,” explains Knag.

“A mature woman and a much younger man – we’ve seen that before. But it was the political part of it all that really shocked me. He’s 18: it’s not illegal. But he’s vulnerable, because he doesn’t have anyone else in this country. And the only person who wants to help can also destroy him.”

As Amir moves in with Eva and her husband, who at first sees it as a political opportunity, things get out of hand rather quickly.

“In Norway, we’re very idealistic. We want to help – as long as it’s on our terms, which could be said for so many Western countries. When Amir threatens to ruin the façade of their marriage, he stops being important. It’s uncomfortable, and hypocritical, but people do things like that,” notes Knag.

Some potential actors found the story “too controversial,” she admits.

“They would say: ‘I can’t see myself play a character who has this kind of relationship.’ They were also afraid of intimate scenes – but not Pia. She wanted to push her boundaries. She said that’s why she became an actor.”

In the film, Tjelta’s joined by Tarek Zayat as Amir and Kristoffer Joner, the latter known also outside of Norway thanks to roles in “The Revenant” and “Mission Impossible – Fallout.”

Despite its tricky subject matter, audience-oriented Knag didn’t want to make a “repulsive” film. She also took her time exploring her characters’ murky motivations.

“Listen – I graduated from film school in 2010. Now, 15 years later, I finally made my feature debut. It’s been a long journey, and I am 41 years old now. I feel ready,” she laughs.

“I want people to find it exciting, emotional, shocking, even a little funny. I hope they’ll fall in love with Eva, and only then I’ll try to sneak in some uncomfortable truths. Not thinking about the consequences of your choices… That’s so human.”

She notes: “We immediately understand something is broken in her, and that makes her decisions a bit easier to understand. It was so important to make her someone me and my friends could relate to. Because when she finally crosses that line, it surprises you even more.”

“It could happen to anyone.”

Protesters clashed outside a hotel in Altrincham housing asylum seekers on Sunday evening (July 27).

Groups waving Union Jack flags which read 'Uniting Britain' and 'The Great Britain National Protest' gathered opposite the Cresta Court hotel on Church Street.

The hotel closed last year, with all future bookings moved to alternative hotels in and around Trafford. It came after the owners of the venue reportedly agreed a deal with Serco.

It was announced by Labour leader of Trafford Council, Tom Ross, that the hotel closed as a result of the move; a decision made by the Home Office.

On Sunday (July 27), counter-protesters also gathered directly outside the venue, on the opposite side of the road, equally brandishing banners and signs.

Plaques which read 'Stop the far right' and 'stand up to racism' were waved as groups shouted across to one another. Chants of 'say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here' were also shouted into a microphone.

Greater Manchester Police were also in attendance. The force said during the afternoon that nobody was arrested. They have been contacted for an update by the M.E.N.

Groups of officers were seen talking to a number of protestors who had also positioned themselves on a grass verge beside the road. Multiple police vehicles and vans were also in attendance as the two groups were kept separate.

An army of officers and Tactical Aid teams were also seen surrounding the perimeter of the hotel. Officers were seen speaking to members of both groups as insults were hurled across both sides.

A post shared on Facebook indicated that The Great British National Protest had joined with the Altrincham Against the Cresta Court Hotel group to host the demonstration.

They claimed it was 'to help keep pressure on this government and keep rising awareness on this issue.'

The protest was also livestreamed on YouTube to thousands of viewers.

Two men were charged with public order offences after a protest of about 400 anti-immigration and 250 counter-protesters outside a hotel in Diss on Saturday, Norfolk constabulary said. There was a further protest outside a hotel in Canary Wharf in London on Sunday, with the number of protesters appearing to be in the low hundreds.

The demonstration in Epping in Essex on Sunday – where as many as 500 anti-immigrant protesters gathered behind metal barriers outside the Bell hotel – was the latest in a series of protests that began after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault for allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl. Hadush Kebatu, 41, from Ethiopia, has denied the offences and is in custody.

Protesters wore T-shirts and held up signs bearing the slogan “protect our kids”, while others waved England flags. Other flags seen included one for Reform UK, and a white flag with a red cross on a blue square, as seen in the US at anti-abortion demonstrations.

Counter-protesters held banners including one that read “Don’t let the far right divide us with their hatred and violence”, and “Care for refugees”. They chanted “Refugees are welcome here” and “Nazi scum off our streets”.

Police said three people were arrested during the peaceful protest, two from the anti-hotel protest group and the other from the counter-protest group. “I want to thank those who attended for the peaceful nature of both protests,” said Ch Supt Simon Anslow of Essex police. “I am pleased that today has passed off without incident and I am grateful to our colleagues from other forces for their support.”

In a letter sent to the Guardian, asylum seekers said “harmful stereotypes” about refugees did not reflect the truth. “There are some refugees who do not behave respectfully or who do not follow the rules of the host society. But those individuals do not represent all of us,” they said. “As with any group of people, there are both good and bad – and it is unfair to judge the majority by the actions of a few.”

The letter mentioned fleeing persecution and violence. “We refugees are not here to take advantage of the system. We are here to rebuild our lives, to work, and to contribute,” they wrote, adding: “This letter is not a plea for sympathy, but a call for understanding and fairness.”

Outside the Bell hotel, one local woman, who did not want to be named, said residents had complained about an increase in antisocial incidents since it began housing asylum seekers but felt ignored and unfairly labelled as “far right”.

“I’m not saying everyone in any of these hotels is up to no good. I’m not going to judge everyone, but there is no vetting,” she said. “We won’t stop until they start listening and shut this hotel down.”

Activists from far-right groups including Homeland, Patriotic Alternative and the neo-Nazi White Vanguard movement have been present at previous protests. On Sunday Kai Stephens, the Norfolk branch organiser for Homeland, held a sign that said: “Put local people first.”

Stephens said: “Unfortunately, there has to be a certain point where we turn around and say, the British people should be put first, the indigenous British people.”

Supporters of the far-right activist Tommy Robinson were also present. Robinson, 42, whose real name is Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, had said he would attend before changing his mind and saying it would not be helpful to protesters.

Other local protesters said far-right agitators were not welcome. “It’s 100% unhelpful, because it just gives them a message which is not what we’re trying to achieve here,” said one man, who did not want to be named.

Stand Up to Racism, the group that organised the counter-protest, estimated about 700 people had gone to Epping. Lewis Nielsen, an officer at Stand Up to Racism, said Nigel Farage’s Reform UK had emboldened the far right.

“It’s a really dangerous situation at the moment because you haven’t just got the protest here, you’ve got other protests coming up around the country,” Nielsen said. “We stopped the riots last August with these kinds of mobilisations, and that’s why we’re pleased the one today has been successful.”

One protester, Joshua Bailey, who said he grew up in Epping, said increasing anti-immigration sentiment had made people of colour in his friend group feel vulnerable and threatened. “It’s very important that we have a positive stance towards refugees, who are people fleeing genuine tragedy and disaster.”

He said he did not agree with chants that labelled protesters as fascists or Nazis. “There is room for nuance,” he said. “I’d like to be able to sit down in a pub with someone who had opposing views and be able to speak about it.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

Counter-protesters outside the Britannia Hotel in Wolverhampton

A planned protest outside a Midland hotel used to house asylum seekers failed to take place after counter-protesters gathered outside.

A demonstration was planned outside the Britannia Hotel in Wolverhampton today, Sunday, July 27, in response to the government housing some migrants in hotels.

In September 2021, it was reported the Britannia Hotel was used to house around 200 asylum seekers.

No large demonstration took place, but it appeared a handful of people turned up for the planned protest with one bearing a Union flag.

They were outnumbered by 30 to 40 counter-protestors also arrived, holding signs and placards - with messages such as 'no to racism', 'stop the far right' and 'stand united' - and chanting messages.

A handful of police officers stood across from the hotel outside The Prince Albert pub, monitoring the situation.

One member of the public walked past saying 'at least it is peaceful' while another referenced the recent disturbances in Essex.

Amidst the crowd of counter protestors was a musician playing 'Everything's Gonna Be Alright'.

The North Staffordshire Campaign Against Racism and Fascism group posted later on Facebook: "" Unity won the day, alongside £230 raised for the residents of the hotel. Meanwhile six people with a flimsy-looking flag loitered awkwardly at the edges. ""

Chants through a loudspeaker also echoed in front of the hotel, with counter protestors stating messages such as, 'Say it now, say it clear, refugees are welcome here'.

The planned protest outside the hotel followed demonstrations in the past two weeks outside the site in Epping which was housing asylum seekers.

The situation for men living in the Bell hotel, where they had previously felt safe, has been transformed since the protests began, according to another asylum seeker who was filmed being chased down the street by men involved in the demonstrations.

Speaking near the hotel in Epping, an asylum seeker who had fled war in his home country of Yemen said injuries on his face had been caused when six men attacked him while he was out walking.

“They were in two cars and they were ready. They were waiting for us,” said Nabil*. As he spoke, abuse was shouted from a car driving past.

A friend who was with him, Jibreel*, from Kuwait, said those in the hotel were being confined to their rooms during the protests, which are now happening during the week and at the weekends.

“It’s not safe for us here and we know this,” he said. “We’re here in the UK for different reasons – in my case it’s because of politics and persecution in my home – but we just want to be able to live, to study and do something here. He said he had crossed the Channel in a small boat from France, arriving with the body of a friend who had drowned en route.

Police have made 18 arrests and charged seven people in connection with the demonstrations, which have drawn hundreds, including local people as well as far-right activists. The gatherings began after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault, although the far right has targeted the hotel for years.

Asylum seekers living in the hotel have told the Guardian they want it to close as they no longer feel safe there.

Abdi*, an asylum seeker from east Africa who was chased down the street by some protesters outside the hotel, said he had been unable to sleep since the attack.

“I don’t speak good English but I knew some of the swearwords they were shouting at me, like ‘motherfucker’. I have been living in the hotel since April and before the protesters arrived I felt safe here and we had no problem at all with the local residents, who were nice to us.

“But when I was chased I felt as if I was running for my life. I am sure it was a racist attack because I am black and the people pursuing me were white and I had done nothing to them. I hadn’t broken the law, I make sure I never even drop litter. I was just walking along carrying some shopping.

“But now I feel that some of the protesters want to get people like me. I experienced bad things in my country but here I can’t even ask those people who attacked me why they attacked me, because my English is not good.

“I didn’t come to this country to cause harm to anyone, just to feel safe. If the police were not here, I don’t know what we would do. They are the only thing standing between us and some of the protesters attacking us. Before we used to leave the hotel individually but now we leave in bigger groups for protection.”

The protests show no sign of easing, and a major police operation is planned for this Sunday. Counter-demonstrators from Stand Up to Racism are also planning to gather in Epping.

The protests are being promoted on Facebook groups, while misinformation is being shared and amplified on X. One Facebook group – Epping Says No! – has administrators from the far-right Homeland party.

Asylum seekers in hotels in other areas of the country were watching the protests anxiously and said they were fearful too.

However, several of them had signed an open letter, coordinated by the charity Care4Calais, addressed to “our brothers and sisters in Epping and others in asylum accommodation”. It states: “We thought we were safe in the UK but now we are afraid again. Let’s not allow fear to divide us. Let’s keep supporting one another.”

Addressing the British public, it says: “Some of you have shown us great kindness and we will never forget it. Please keep standing up against hate.”

Appealing to the UK government, it says: “While we wait [for our asylum decisions] protect us, respect us and treat us with dignity.”

Research shared with the Guardian by the refugee theatre group Phosphoros Theatre found that, of 37 young asylum seekers surveyed, 49% felt mentally affected by last year’s riots one year on, and 69% felt loneliness.

The Reform UK MP claimed a man charged with rape in Sutton in Ashfield, in his constituency, is an asylum seeker. Nottinghamshire Live has been unable to verify this claim.

The posts, on Mr Anderson's X and Facebook pages, sparked protesters to gather in the town centre. A counter protest also took place, although the anti-illegal immigration protesters outnumbered the counter-protest.

The atmosphere in the town was highly-charged as people shouted ""stop the boats"" and blamed Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer for high levels of migration.

Nottinghamshire Police arrested a man after a woman was allegedly sexually assaulted at Sutton Lawn. He appeared at Nottingham Magistrates' Court on Tuesday, July 22 and was remanded in custody until August 19.

Counter-protesters from Stand Up To Racism confirmed their attendance in the Nottinghamshire town. Their protest started from around 4.30pm. The protesters, who say they oppose illegal immigration, met at Portland Square at 5pm in Sutton-in-Ashfield town centre for a ""peaceful protest"".

Announcing the policy on Friday, the Home Office said some migrants were ""gaming the system"" by resisting efforts to move them into alternative housing without a valid reason.

Politics Live: Macron lays out plan for France to recognise a Palestinian state.

The new Failure to Travel policy means housing support will be removed from those who block transfer requests.

The Home Office said this will ""ensure individuals who are moved from hotels to suitable alternative accommodation must take it"".

They added: ""Those who refuse to move without a valid reason will now risk losing their housing and support. It is a firm but fair approach, aimed to end abuse of asylum support and contribute towards the closure of costly hotel accommodation.

""While the government has a duty to support all asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute in appropriate accommodation, the new policy establishes clear consequences for those who game the system whilst protecting the vulnerable.""

There would be several steps before stripping someone of accommodation - with it being a last resort, Sky News understands.

It follows a week of unrest outside a hotel in Epping used to house asylum seekers.

Several demonstrations have been held outside the Bell Hotel since 13 July, after an asylum seeker was charged with allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl.

Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, from Ethiopia, denied sexually assaulting the 14-year-old girl at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court last week and will stand trial in August.

On Thursday Epping council unanimously voted to urge the government to shut the site.

Ministers are under pressure to restore order amid fears of further unrest, like that seen in Southport last summer.

Labour has pledged to end the use of asylum hotels by the end of this parliament, a move chancellor Rachel Reeves has claimed will save £1bn a year.

However there is a question mark as to how this will be achieved as Channel Crossings continue to rise. Nearly 20,000 migrants made the journey to the UK in the first six months of this year, a rise of almost 50% on the number crossing in 2024 and a new record for the first half of a year.

Ministers say they inherited a ""broken system"", with 400 hotels being used to accommodate asylum seekers at the peak of the crisis under the Tories, costing £9 million per day.

Minister for Border Security and Asylum, Dame Angela Eagle, said: ""We inherited an asylum system on the brink of collapse - mismanaged, under strain, and costing the public a fortune. We are getting a grip.

""We are working to close hotels, restore order, and put fairness and value for money at the heart of our asylum system. This government is making those necessary decisions to protect the taxpayer and uphold the integrity of our borders.

""These reforms to the Failure to Travel policy are another example of this government's action to transform the asylum accommodation system and crack down on those who abuse our system, so it operates fairly and saves the taxpayer money.""",GNews,-0.78,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/sky-news-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.79,"sky news, SkyNews, Sky News UK, sky.com/news, sky.com",,https://ground.news/interest/sky-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/sky-news-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,,,,Center,High,Center,Unknown,Left,Lean Left,Center,news.sky.com,,sky news,31,UK,Y,E,Sky News,

Venice (CNN) — The abandoned Venetian island of Poveglia — site of a plague pit and former asylum — is about to take on a happier new identity.

On August 1, a group of Venetians will take possession of the supposedly haunted island under a 99-year lease from the Italian state and embark on a project to turn it into an urban park open only to residents of the Italian city.

The locals fought off stiff competition from property developers to ensure Poveglia remained a public asset.

In 2014, the island, which is around 7.5 hectares (18.5 acres) in size and sits in the southern part of the Venice lagoon, was put on an auction list by the Italian State Property Agency, opening it up to developers tempted by its peaceful but convenient location just three miles from St. Mark’s Square.

Several consortia raised money to buy it, including one tied to Luigi Brugnaro, the current mayor of Venice, whose group raised 513,000 euros ($600,000) but failed to gain approval from the state.

Horrified at the prospect of the island being sold to a private buyer, Patrizia Veclani formed a group, Poveglia per Tutti (Poveglia For Everyone), to try to save the island and others like it that are on the government’s auction list.

The group, which has more than 4,500 members, managed to raise 460,000 euros ($539,000) and secure the lease.

“It wasn’t just outrage, it was psychologically traumatic to realize that the city could be broken up and sold to the highest bidder, without a starting price, without even a plan. It’s as if Rome were to decide to sell the Trevi Fountain. Venice and its Lagoon are one, inseparable,” Veclani said at a public forum last month, before the winning bid was announced.

Veclani told CNN on Friday that her group sees this as a small victory in reclaiming Venice from overtourism, a longstanding problem.

An estimated 30 million tourists visit the city every year, dwarfing the local population, which has now dwindled to less than 50,000, despite authorities’ efforts to limit visitor numbers through measures such as a 2021 ban on cruise ships and a 5 euro ($5.86) charge for day-trippers introduced last year.

“The island would never have been as popular as other places,” Veclani said, “but keeping this small space just for Venetians is a victory.”

An overgrown woodland, a military fortress, 15 dilapidated hospital buildings and a rather large colony of rabbits are all that remain on the island, the group says.

Poveglia’s spooky history goes back to an outbreak of the bubonic plague in the 18th century, brought to Venice by fleas on merchant ships during a period when the city was an international trading hub.

As the plague spread, the island was converted into a maritime quarantine dock for merchant ships arriving from abroad and for people with symptoms.

Before that, it was inhabited by farmers and fishermen, having been founded as a Roman military base in 421 CE.

The island’s farm buildings and military barracks were transformed into dormitories, where the sick lived together and were subjected to primitive treatments, like bloodletting.

As the plague spread, the dead were buried in mass graves. Venetian historians estimate that more than 160,000 people were buried on the island between the 18th and 19th centuries.

In the 19th century, Poveglia became an asylum for mentally ill people, who were often restrained and subject to experimental treatments.

The asylum closed in 1968, and the island has been uninhabited ever since.

Poveglia’s sad history led some to believe that it was haunted.

Modern ghost-hunters, including US television series “Ghost Adventures,” have visited the island over the years, spreading the myths further.

“The island was made famous by foreigners who were looking for something to exploit,” Massimo Pera, a patron of the group, told CNN.

“The memories of the island are steeped in pain, but we will transform it into a place of joy.”

The renovation of the island, which lacks electricity and running water, is being guided by the APsyM laboratory at the University of Verona’s department of human sciences.

“The memories of the island are steeped in pain, but we will transform it into a place of joy.”

The renovation of the island, which lacks electricity and running water, is being guided by the APsyM laboratory at the University of Verona’s department of human sciences.",GNews,-6.23,,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnn-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.09,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/,https://ground.news/interest/cnn,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.7),USA,,TV Station/Website,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Turner Broadcasting System,1980,-1.3,Lean Left,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,edition.cnn.com,,cable news network,57,USA,Y,F,CNN,
141,3,LEGO unveils the modular Batman: Arkham Asylum set with 16 minifigures and tons of detail,https://9to5toys.com/2025/07/24/lego-batman-arkham-asylum-set/,2025-07-24T20:51:07Z,9to5Toys,US,asylum,"After the exciting news this morning about LEGO’s unveiling of the new Game Boy set that is now open for preorder, the LEGO Group has also shined a light on its latest DC collaboration in the form of the upcoming 76300 Batman: Arkham Asylum set – and it’s open for preorder too! This new modular set is the biggest variation of Gotham City’s iconic institution to date – plus it comes packed with tons of minifigures of the Caped Crusader, his allies, and plenty of villains to stage countless scenes and stories of your own creation. Head below to learn more about what you can expect and browse through all the collected photos.

The news on LEGO’s new 76300 Batman: Arkham Asylum set is coming out of San Diego Comic Con 2025 and giving us the biggest version of the famous institution yet. Fun fact: its name takes inspiration from the famous fictional town in some of H.P. Lovecraft’s body of sci-fi horror stories, which is quite fitting given the general aesthetic within the Batman universe.

What’s really great about this set is that it comes as another of LEGO’s modular building kits, so whether you’re creating a Gotham City-themed display or just want the biggest and most diverse LEGO city – this set will certainly fit right in, literally. It stacks up to 2,953 pieces and splits up into three separate segments – the first floor, the second floor, and the roof – with plenty of removable elements so you can access the interior spaces. There’s plenty of fun details spread amongst the levels, like the inmate delivery van, prison cells that open, and a massive collection of 65 stickers that harken to Batman lore, among many more – even a Superman Easter Egg that references Metropolis. As noted by the LEGO Group, “each section comes in one of 24 bags, which makes it perfectly suited for use as a Batman Advent calendar.”

Along with the many set pieces, you’ll also be getting 16 minifigures: Batman, Batwoman, Batwing, Robin, Mr. Freeze, The Riddler, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, Scarecrow, Harley Quinn, Bane, The Joker, The Penguin, Killer Croc and 2 security guards.

The new LEGO Batman: Arkham Asylum set is set to release on September 9, 2025 for Insiders with general release coming a few days later. You can preorder yours today though at $299.99 shipped. And be sure to head below to check out all the collected photos:

142,86,Lego’s Game Boy Model Is Pocket-Sized Perfection,https://gizmodo.com/sdcc-2025-lego-game-boy-wicked-arkham-asylum-price-release-date-2000633722,2025-07-24T14:30:20Z,Gizmodo,US,asylum,"We got you an early sneak peek at just one of Lego’s new reveals for San Diego Comic-Con last night, but the brickmaker took to the convention floor to kick off SDCC 2025 in style with even more reveals. There’s a lot to love, but the absolute highlight is the nostalgic joy of the company’s new brick-built Game Boy.

Alongside the new Stranger Things BrickHeadz collection (check out all those details here!), Lego came to SDCC with three major new product sets: the first is its previously teased Game Boy, joining the NES and other Lego Nintendo model kits in a near-perfect replica of the legendary handheld. Wicked: For Good fans also got to rejoicify over a whole line of new sets based on the upcoming movie (and let us be glad and grateful, as there were even some goodies for Wicked fans who aren’t keen on minidolls). Then DC Comics fans were treated to the first-ever modular set to come to the superhero line: an updated spin on Gotham’s most nefarious haunt, Arkham Asylum, bursting with bad guys.

Check out all the details from Lego’s latest releases below, including prices and when you can grab them.

Lego Nintendo Game Boy

The 421-piece Game Boy set is an almost 1:1 scale replica of the real thing, right down to actual clickable buttons and moving dials for the system’s volume and contrast settings (ah, the nostalgic perils of trying to play your Game Boy on a bright day). As well as a small display stand set, the Game Boy comes with two buildable game paks of some iconic handheld classics: Super Mario Land, and The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening, both of which can be slotted into the cartridge slot on the console.

Lego might not have been able to condense a functioning Game Boy emulator into the build, but the next best thing comes in the form of three functioning lenticular screens you can slot in: one depicting the classic Game Boy start-up screen, and then one each depicting moments from Super Mario Land and Link’s Awakening in action. ($60, available to pre-order here for an October 1 release)

Lego Wicked: For Good Sets

Ahead of returning to Oz this November for the second part of the Wicked movie adaptation, Lego revealed six new sets inspired by For Good. Alongside a set of BrickHeadz models of Elphaba and Glinda inspired by their looks in the second movie, there were also several small minidoll sets replicating key scenes from the new film, including Glinda and Fiyero’s wedding, returning to Munchkinland, and of course Elphaba’s new abode in Kiamo Ko.

But for Wicked fans who prefer traditional sets, there’s good news too, as the crowning Wicked reveal was a Lego Art set, depicting a buildable image of the Emerald City and Oz. Clocking in at 1,518 pieces, the wall art includes spaces to store six included minifigures: primary display sections for minifigures of Elphaba and Glinda, and then a secret compartment hidden behind its depiction of Munchkinland to reveal Dorothy (and Toto), the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the Scarecrow. All the Wicked: For Good sets are due to release September 1.

Lego DC Superheroes Batman: Arkham Asylum

Rounding out Lego’s SDCC reveals was a return to Arkham for the first time since the Lego Batman Movie sets. This massive 2,953-piece set includes a three-tiered buildable Arkham Asylum (and an inmate van, to boot) that has been designed to be able to connect to Lego’s iconic modular city builds so you can bring Gotham to your burgeoning cityscape. Of course, the Asylum needs inmates and guards to manage them, and heroes to put them there in the first place, so it comes packed with a whopping sixteen minifigures, including Batman, Robin, Batwoman, Batwing, and Catwoman alongside two Arkham guards, Poison Ivy, Mr. Freeze, and the Riddler in their classic outfits, and Harley Quinn, Bane, the Penguin, Scarecrow, and Killer Croc in Arkham jumpsuits.

The set is due to release September 9, but in a special twist, if you wanted to save this for the holidays to gift the Bat-loving Lego fan in your life, the new Arkham Asylum also includes steps to build the whole thing in a special 24-day Advent Calendar format. Given the vibes, though, maybe it’s better to make it as a Halloween countdown instead of a Christmas one? ($300, available to preorder here)

143,84,Lego's Massive Batman Arkham Asylum Set Doubles As A Unique Advent Calendar,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-arkham-asylum-buildable-advent-calendar/1100-6533359/,2025-07-24T01:30:00Z,GameSpot,US,asylum,"As part of its San Diego Comic-Con showcase, Lego has unveiled the next large-scale Batman building set for adults and collectors. Batman Arkham Asylum is a massive 2,953-piece Lego interpretation of the psychiatric hospital in Gotham City where many of the Caped Crusader's longtime foes are often confined (before escaping again). This highly detailed recreation of Arkham Asylum comes with 16 minifigures and has a modular design that Lego says can double as a 24-day buildable Advent Calendar.

Lego DC Batman Arkham Asylum launches September 9 and is available to preorder for $300 exclusively at the Lego Store.

Lego DC Arkham Asylum (2,953 Pieces) $300 | Releases September 9 Though Lego DC Arkham Asylum isn't officially categorized as an Advent Calendar, the build is seemingly a great fit for one-piece-per-day setup of the popular holiday countdown calendars. You can build one chunk of the building each day for 24 days. Considering it comes with sprawling collection of 16 Batman heroes and villains as minifigures, you'll get a new character most days, too. Here's the full list of minifigures included with Lego DC Batman Arkham Asylum: Batman

Robin

Batwoman

Catwoman

Batwing

The Joker

Harley Quinn

The Riddler

The Penguin

Bane

Mr. Freeze

Poison Ivy

Scarecrow

Killer Croc

Security Guard (x2) Lego's actual Advent Calendars are substantially smaller than this--the 2025 editions retail for $45 and release September 1--so this would be quite the lavish choice for your countdown this year. You can, of course, completely ignore the Advent Calendar approach and build the entire set in one weekend. The full three-story asylum is 10.23 x 9.84 x 12.59 inches. If that sounds a bit small based on the piece count, it's because this is more densely packed with a huge emphasis on the rooms inside. Plus, unlike some Lego sets that don't have exterior walls around the sides and back, Arkham Asylum is a complete structure. After finishing the build, you can separate the three floors to show off and make changes to the furnished rooms and holding cells. Sections on each floor are designed to be easily removable, too. Prison cell doors can swing open with the press of a button, and you can let the villains decorate their cells with 65 stickers pulled from Batman lore. All of the minifigures come wit transparent stands that attach to the building or front yard. The stands are designed to create active poses, as if you paused a movie. The build also comes with an Arkham Asylum inmate transport van. In the promotional images, the van is operated by Harley Quinn, who is clearly on the verge of successfully breaking Joker out of the hospital. Preorder at Lego Store

San Diego Comic-Con Lego Sets

Arkham Asylum is one of several exciting Lego sets making its debut at SDCC. Lego also unveiled its Game Boy building set, a 421-piece replica of the original Nintendo Game Boy. The Lego Game Boy releases October 1, the same day as the newly announced Stranger Things BrickHeadz. The four-pack of buildable figures is only the second Stranger Things Lego set--the first launched back in 2019--and arrives just in time for the long-awaited final season on Netflix. Lego will also expand its lineup of Wicked building sets with six new products, including display models for adults and playsets, on September 1.

Batman Lego Sets Available Now

Lego DC Batman Lego Sets

The new Arkham Asylum display model joins the existing catalog of cool Lego sets featuring the Caped Crusader, Gotham's biggest villains, many different variations of the Batmobile, and other Gotham City landmarks.

Arkham Asylum isn't the only Batman Lego set launching soon. You can bide the time until September by picking up the Batman Forever Batmobile. The 909-piece recreation of the unique design from the 1995 film launches August 1 and costs $100. It's one of many Batman Lego sets that focus on the Batmobile or one of his other stylish rides like the Bat-Pod from The Dark Knight Trilogy. The Bat-Pod is available in a pretty awesome set with a Batman Construction Figure for $48 (was $65) at Walmart. Meanwhile, the retired Lego Technic: Batcycle from The Batman (2022) is only available at Walmart and on sale for $40 (was $50).

The Arkham Asylum set will be one of the most elaborate Batman Lego sets in the current lineup. It doesn't have the most pieces, though. That honor goes to Batman: The Animated Series Gotham City, a large piece of 3D wall art featuring the skyline. It retails for the same $300 price as Arkham Asylum, but it has 4,210 pieces. The Arkham Asylum build will likely be more dynamic, though, as these 3D art pieces have high piece counts partly because of all of the tiny bricks that create the backdrops.

Moving beyond Lego, Batman fans should also check out the upcoming Amazon-exclusive Steelbook Library Edition of The Dark Knight Trilogy. It comes with four steelbook cases, a bunch of collectibles, and metal case to store and display all of it.

144,37,Future uncertain for programs supporting unaccompanied migrant children facing immigration court,https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/future-uncertain-programs-supporting-unaccompanied-migrant-children-immigration-court/,2025-07-24T00:06:23Z,CBS News,US,asylum,"For migrants newly in the United States, including many who don't speak English, navigating immigration court is complicated. It's even harder for children sent here alone.

There are organizations around the U.S. that help minors navigate the process, but the future of these programs is now uncertain.

""The different circumstances that lead these children to arrive have to do with poverty, have to do with persecution,"" said Farheen Siddiqi, a managing attorney at the International Rescue Committee (IRC), a nonprofit that helps people affected by humanitarian crises across the U.S. and the world. ""They're already carrying a high level of trauma.""

For migrant children, who range in age from 3 to 17 years old and arrive in the U.S. without a guardian, applying for asylum can be another confusing obstacle.

""The immigration system is so complex,"" Siddiqi said. ""And then seeing the children's faces. They have really no idea how to navigate that.""

It's why U.S. law provides protections for unaccompanied children and why federal grants go toward legal representation for these children.

The International Rescue Committee is one of the groups that receives funding to help unaccompanied minors.

""We've gone through a lot of different variations of the funding being cut,"" Siddiqi said.

This year, Siddiqi said the money that organizations like the IRC rely on has been jeopardized.

In March, the network that oversees these nonprofits received a letter from the Department of the Interior ending the contract that pays for the network's services.

It puts legal representation for about 26,000 unaccompanied kids at risk. As a result, some of the nonprofits have sued.

A federal judge has since restored the funding, for now.

""But ... there's no certainty as to the future of the program,"" Siddiqi said. ""It's only until September that we have continued funding.""

""If this elimination extends, in the future, that means that these children are going to be left with no representation whatsoever,"" Siddiqi added.

Ultimately, that could mean children alone in courtrooms, unable to adequately present their case for immigration relief, end up with deportation orders.

""As attorneys, we might be able to find another job, but these children and their future is at risk, ultimately,"" Siddiqi said.",GNews,-3.03,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.88,"cbs news, CBS, CBS News, cbsnews.com, cbsnews",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/,https://ground.news/interest/cbs-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,CBS Corporation,1927,-1.5,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,cbsnews.com,,cbs news,21,USA,Y,G,CBS News,
145,37,"Wife of asylum-seeker speaks on detention center's conditions: ""He did not deserve any of this""",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/immigrant-detention-center-new-york-city-video-conditions/,2025-07-23T00:10:00Z,CBS News,US,asylum,"Video released Tuesday by the New York Immigration Coalition gives a first look inside some of the holding cells of New York City's federal immigration offices.

It shows men sleeping on the floor on thin thermal blankets. At one point, a man is heard saying, ""Look how they have us ... like dogs in here.""

There are reports the lights are kept on around the clock and nearly 30 people share a single toilet.

Joan Paul Alcivar De La Cruz was held at the facility for several days last month before being sent to Jackson Parish Correctional Center in Louisiana. His wife, Samara De La Cruz, told CBS News he was fed just a sandwich and bottle of water each day while at the New York facility.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin says detainees were ""briefly"" held at the New York City facility, and that ""any claim that there is overcrowding or subprime conditions at ICE facilities are categorically false.""

Samara said her husband was fleeing persecution in Ecuador and it wouldn't be safe for him to return there. She said he was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement at his asylum hearing, a tactic ICE has been using amid the Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration that is facing legal challeneges.

""He did not deserve any of this. He did not. He made sure he followed all the laws. He went to all his immigration courts. He's never been arrested. He's never had any criminal record,"" Samara said.

She's an American citizen. The two were married in May. Samara was pregnant at the time of her husband's arrest, but went on to have a miscarriage, which she blames on the stress of her husband's detention.

""It was kind of, uh, very traumatic for me,"" she said.

But even though Joan was moved to a different facility, Samara says she fears for her husband's life, saying he's been denied life-saving medication for a liver condition at both detention centers.

McLaughlin has said all ICE detainees are provided with proper meals and medical treatment.

""He said he requested to go to the hospital multiple times. They just ignored him like turned their back and pretended like he didn't say anything,"" Samara told CBS News.

She said despite the danger of him being deported to Ecuador, she's even more afraid of him remaining in the detention facility.

""Because he's suffering in there. You know, he's in so much pain. If they continue what they're doing and not giving him what he needs, he's going to die in there,"" she said.",GNews,-3.03,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.88,"cbs news, CBS, CBS News, cbsnews.com, cbsnews",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/,https://ground.news/interest/cbs-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,CBS Corporation,1927,-1.5,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,cbsnews.com,,cbs news,21,USA,Y,G,CBS News,
146,210,"‘There is history here’: For Laredo’s baseball team, the US/Mexico border is their true hometown",https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2025/jul/29/there-is-history-here-for-laredos-baseball-team-the-usmexico-border-is-their-true-hometown,2025-07-29T12:00:29Z,The Guardian,GB,border,"The differences between attending a baseball game in the US and Mexico are difficult to miss. The on-field rules are identical, but the atmosphere in Mexican baseball stands is noisy, musical, constant and infectious. The two fan cultures are distinct enough that, were you to drop a blindfolded supporter into either crowd, they would be able to identify which side of the Rio Grande they stood within seconds – or so you might think. Reality is never so binary.

Despite the often unyielding political debates about them, international borders rarely possess hard edges. This is particularly true in South Texas, and not merely as some writerly conceit - even that most material indicator of crossing a border, a checkpoint with customs officers, can be found 50 miles away from the actual national boundary. The Rio Grande may delineate where Mexico and the US officially begin and end, but the famous river simultaneously exists at the centre of economies, communities and individual lives that span both of its banks. Living with one foot in Laredo (on the US side) and the other in Nuevo Laredo (in Mexico) is so intrinsic to life here that it’s even reflected in the name of the cities’ beloved baseball team, los Tecolotes de los Dos Laredos (the Two Laredos Owls).

Like many things in border regions, the team affectionately known as “los Tecos” enjoys multiple identities. As their name suggests, they play home games on both sides of the border, making them simultaneously Mexican, American and, perhaps most of all, representative of the blended experience that has always survived in the blurry lines between the two.

“The US-Mexican border es una herida abierta [is an open wound] where the Third World grates against the First and bleeds,” wrote Gloria Anzaldúa, a scholar and South Texas native whose Borderlands/La Frontera is considered a seminal work on the subject. “The lifeblood of two worlds merg[es] to form a third country.” This third country, to many, is the cultural zone known as La Frontera (the border).

People on either side of many borders often have more in common with each other than they do with their compatriot communities deeper in their own countries’ heartlands. This is the case along the Rio Grande and, as such, los Tecos can also be viewed as La Frontera’s de facto national team. They are first and foremost, however, representatives of the two Laredos.

“Yes, there are fans in Matamoros, Reynosa, Piedras Negras [other cities along the Texas-Mexico border],” says Juan Alanis, a media official for los Tecos who also serves as one of the team’s play-by-play broadcasters. “The base, the nucleus [however] is in the two Laredos … there’s a history here.”

Los Tecos compete in the Liga Mexicana de Béisbol (the Mexican Baseball League, or LMB), a competition featuring twenty teams spread across much of the country, from Tijuana to Cancún. Club baseball lacks a standard metric for comparing domestic leagues à la European football but, depending on the criteria and source, the LMB is arguably the third- to sixth-strongest domestic competition in the world. Although LMB baseball falls well below the standard of play in the MLB and Japan’s NPB, it is arguably as good as (or better than) leagues in Korea, Venezuela and the Dominican Republic (during the LMB’s offseason, Mexico also hosts a smaller and shorter winter baseball league which some pundits argue to be Mexico’s highest standard of baseball).

What can be said about without debate, however, is that the LMB was considered a AAA competition (i.e., on par with the second-highest level of competition in the U.S.) from 1967 until the 2021 restructuring of minor league baseball. The LMB is also older than all the non-US leagues mentioned above – indeed, the league is now celebrating its 100th anniversary.Los Tecos have been there for most of it.

Mexican baseball clubs bounce from city to city at least as much as their US counterparts, but a club called los Tecolotes has played in either Laredo or Nuevo Laredo for the vast majority of seasons since the 1940s. The current team may technically be the third franchise to bear the Tecos name, but such trivialities seem to matter little to fans.

“The entire place was a party,” fan Ricardo Ábrego says of los Tecos’ penultimate championship in 1977 (two franchises ago). A 58-year-old carpenter from Nuevo Laredo, Ábrego attended the match with his extended family and smiles at the memory. Sporting a plushie Tecos mascot poking out of his breast pocket, it’s fair to call Ábrego a superfan. When asked what los Tecos mean to him, he replies “todo” (everything) before going on to recount the team’s championship pedigree.

With five titles under their belt, los Tecos are one of the LMB’s winningest teams, roughly analogous to the MLB’s Detroit Tigers in terms of post-season success (as well as their location on the northern border). Such success, when partnered with the team’s longevity in the area, makes Tecos fandom a multi-generational affair.

“I’ve always liked them – my grandfather always liked them,” says 23-year-old factory worker Eduardo Espino. “For my family, it’s baseball more than football. I think it’s because we are from La Frontera, we’re very fronteriza [of the border culture].”

In many ways, Espino exemplifies the Tecos’ binational identity – despite living in Nuevo Laredo, most of his childhood memories of Tecos games are from the Texas side of the border. He speaks with the Guardian, however, while attending a match in Nuevo Laredo, where he prefers the atmosphere.

“The people at the matches in Nuevo Laredo are more emotional,” says Espino “The stands are full and the support is just… more.” Alanis and Ábrego both agree–a slight preference for the (much older) stadium in Nuevo Laredo seems to be a universally acknowledged but unwritten truth among Tecos supporters.

“I prefer the atmosphere in Nuevo Laredo,” says superfan Ábrego, before clarifying that he loves going to games at both sites. “

“[In Nuevo Laredo], the crowd is more passionate, fiercer, more grrrr,” notes Alanis the broadcaster. “But respectful, always respectful … If the fielder of the other team makes a good play, the fans applaud.” This is more than just the positive PR of a marketing professional. On several occasions at the games this correspondent attended, Tecos fans applaud the away team’s defensive efforts. This, however, happens at games in both Laredo and Nuevo Laredo – as ever, either side of the border have much in common.

Yes, the stadium at Nuevo Laredo is a bit louder than its counterpart in Laredo (especially owing to the presence of a regularly hand-cranked raid siren). But, to someone used to East Coast baseball, home games in the two Laredos are more similar than they are different.

On both sides of the border, many plays (even simple strikes early in the count) are greeted with a stadium-wide chorus of twirling matracas, wooden mechanical noisemakers that one spins and were common sights at British football grounds a half-century ago. Hand-pumped airhorns are also popular and regularly activated.

“In Mexico, compared to MLB, there’s always noise, noise, noise until the pitcher pitches, [when] it’s silent,” says Alanis. “You have 12 seconds with the pitch clock, [so] the DJ knows he can play music for ten seconds. It’s very normal in Mexico.” Indeed, either English-language pop music (think Michael Jackson and Clearance Clearwater Revival) or Spanish-language genres popular in La Frontera (think Selena and Grupo Frontera) are loudly piped through the stadium’s speakers until just before the pitcher begins his windup. The music’s constant fading in and out can cause a sensory overload but, given how many fans are actively dancing and singing between pitches, it palpably adds to the atmosphere (and, in line with what every interviewee above said, there is certainly a bit more dancing in the crowd at the game in Nuevo Laredo).

Aside from the acoustic experience, attending an LMB game is a nice mix of the best elements of both major and minor league baseball in the US. As with the minor leagues, a Tecos game is cheap and family friendly; parking is free and just four dollars buys both a hot dog and a small beer, even at the Laredo stadium. Like the US major leagues, however, LMB games feature in-stadium replays on the big screen and significant emotional investment all around the ballpark. Pitchers pound their chest emphatically after a strike out and fans with worried faces clasp their hands in prayer. LMB baseball’s existence at la frontera of minor and major league baseball appeals to players as well fans.

“It’s been fun – everywhere I’ve been has been awesome,” says Stephen Gonsalves, a pitcher for the visiting Charros de Jalisco who previously played for the MLB’s Boston Red Sox and Minnesota Twins. Gonsalves is part of a recent wave of US players who’ve opted to play in the LMB. “There are fewer jobs stateside,” he adds, referring to the nationwide reduction of minor league teams in the US in 2020. “So, now … there are a lot of older, veteran guys that have played in the big leagues. Every team has at least three or four former big leaguers on it… It’s good competition.”

LMB players also seem to enjoy a higher quality of life than their minor league counterparts.

“Minor league baseball was a hassle,” says Andrew Pérez, another pitcher from the visiting Charros team who spent six years with Chicago White Sox organization, including significant time with their AAA affiliate. “I was in the minor leagues when you had eight guys in an apartment.” Now, for players like Pérez and Gonsalves, the most annoying logistical hurdles seem to be the multiple border crossings and hotels during away stands at the two Laredos (home games alternate between Laredo and Nuevo Laredo). This cross-border shuffling seems to be a common complaint among visiting teams, and may even represent a homefield advantage for los Tecos.

For many, many residents of both Laredos (including los Tecos), crossing the US-Mexico border is simply a bureaucratic fact of daily life, much like toll roads or paying for public transport in other cities. Recent surges in media coverage may suggest the presence of some new crisis at the border but, based on those responses of those who live around it, it’s business as usual. Every person interviewed for this article said that they hadn’t noticed a significant change at the border in recent months and, if anything, seemed a little amused by my questions on the subject. In the two Laredos, the border has always been a part of everyday life and will continue to be long after the surge in interest dies down.

By claiming both Laredos as their home, los Tecos’ fronteriza identity represents an older, historical and undivided Laredo that predates the United States and was only bifurcated in the 19th century as a result of the Mexican-American War. Here on the Rio Grande, questions of national jurisdiction seem temporary compared to the longevity of many families’ and communities’ presence in the area.

Military clashes erupted between the neighbouring countries on 24 July, killing at least 35 people and displacing more than 260,000 people on both sides.

Relations deteriorated sharply after an armed confrontation in May that killed a Cambodian soldier. Nationalist passions on both sides further inflamed the situation.

After mounting international calls for peace, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai gathered for talks on Monday, where they agreed to cease border violence.

Here is all you need to know about the situation and how it got to this stage.

What happened in Thailand and Cambodia?

Tensions first broke out last Thursday in an area near the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple along the border of Thailand's Surin province and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province.

Thailand's foreign ministry said Cambodian troops fired ""heavy artillery"" on a Thai military base and also targeted civilian areas, including a hospital.

At least 12 people were killed, including 11 civilians, one of which was an eight-year-old boy.

In response, the Thai army said a Thai F-16 fighter jet bombed military targets in Cambodia.

Cambodia's defence ministry said Thai jets had dropped bombs on a road near the ancient Preah Vihear temple, saying it ""strongly condemns the reckless and brutal military aggression of the Kingdom of Thailand against the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Cambodia"".

Troops from both sides reported ongoing fighting on 28 July. Maly Socheata, a Cambodian defense ministry spokesperson, said the Thai assault was ""ongoing and strong"" on Monday.

What caused the escalation?

For more than a century, Thailand and Cambodia have laid claim to undisputed points along their 817-km (508-mile) land border. This has led to skirmishes over several years and at least a dozen deaths, including during a weeklong exchange of artillery in 2011.

Tensions were reignited in May after a Cambodian soldier was killed during a brief exchange of gunfire, which escalated into a full-blown diplomatic crisis and now has triggered recent armed clashes.

Both countries agreed to de-escalate tensions, but Cambodian and Thai authorities continued to implement or threaten restrictions on the other.

Tighter restrictions on Thailand's land border with Cambodia were implemented, stopping almost all crossings except for students, medical patients and others with essential needs. Thai authorities sealed the border entirely after the escalation in violence.

Meanwhile, Cambodia banned Thai movies and TV shows, stopped the import of Thai fuel, fruits and vegetables and boycotted some of its neighbour's international internet links and power supply.

Cambodia later downgraded diplomatic relations with Thailand to their lowest level, expelled the Thai ambassador and recalled all Cambodian staff from its embassy in Bangkok.

That was in response to Thailand withdrawing its ambassador and expelling the Cambodian ambassador a day earlier, in protest against a number of land mine blasts that injured a total of eight Thai soldiers.

Thai authorities alleged the mines were recently laid along paths that by mutual agreement were supposed to be safe. They said the mines were Russian-made and not of a type used by Thailand's military.

Cambodia accused Thailand of making ""baseless accusations"", pointing out that the unexploded mines could have been from previous periods of unrest.

Political fallout

Earlier in July, Thailand's former prime minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra attempted to resolve tensions via a call with Cambodia's influential former prime minister and current president of the senate, Hun Sen.

Their conversation was later leaked, revealing Ms Shinawatra referred to Mr Sen - who stepped down as prime minister in favour of his son Hun Manet in 2023 - ""uncle"" and criticised Thai military leadership.

Her comments caused widespread outrage and protests and led to Ms Shinawatra being suspended from her position on 1 July after a court ruling.

Her ally, former defence minister Phumtham Wechayachai was appointed as acting prime minister.

'Immediate' ceasefire agreed

After five days of violence, Cambodia's Mr Manet and Thailand's Mr Wechayachai met for peace talks in Malaysia, where they agreed to an ""immediate and unconditional ceasefire"" which comes into effect from midnight on 28 July.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, the current chair of the ASEAN regional bloc, initially proposed the meeting after US President Donald Trump called on both sides to settle their differences.

Mr Trump also warned he would not conclude trade deals with either unless they ended fighting.

""Today we have a very good meeting and very good results... that hope to stop immediately the fighting that has caused many lives lost, injuries and also caused displacement of people,"" Mr Manet said, expressing appreciation to Mr Trump and China for its efforts in participating in the process.

""We hope that the solutions that Prime Minister Anwar just announced will set a condition for moving forward for our bilateral discussion to return to normalcy of the relationship, and as a foundation for future de-escalation of forces.""

Mr Wechayachai, who had earlier expressed doubts about Cambodia's sincerity ahead of the negotiations in Malaysia, said Thailand had agreed to a ceasefire that would ""be carried out successfully in good faith by both sides"".

Why is the border contested?

Tensions over the border largely stem back to a 1907 map drawn under French colonial rule that was used to separate Cambodia from Thailand.

Cambodia has used the map as a reference to claim territory, while Thailand has argued the map is inaccurate.

The most prominent and violent conflicts have been over the 1,000-year-old Preah Vihear temple.

In 1962, the International Court of Justice awarded Cambodia sovereignty over the temple area, which caused irritation between the neighbouring countries.

Cambodia went back to the court in 2011, following several clashes between its army and Thai forces that killed about 20 people and displaced thousands. The court reaffirmed the ruling in Cambodia's favour in 2013.

The move comes after Donald Trump intervened, suggesting to the leaders of both countries that continued hostilities would harm their chances of getting a trade deal with the US.

He posted about the conversations on his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday and later said both sides agreed to meet to negotiate a ceasefire.

Later on Sunday, the US's leading diplomat, Marco Rubio, in phone calls to the foreign ministers of both countries, told them Washington was prepared to facilitate talks and urged them to de-escalate and agree to a ceasefire immediately, the state department said in a statement.

At least 34 people, including 13 civilians, have died, while more than 200,000 have been forced to leave their homes to escape the fighting, now into its fourth day.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said on Sunday his country agreed to pursue an ""immediate and unconditional ceasefire"".

He said Mr Trump told him that Thailand had also agreed to halt attacks following the US leader's conversation with Acting Thai Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai.

The Cambodian leader said it was ""positive news for the soldiers and people of both countries"".

Thailand's foreign ministry expressed cautious support, reporting that its leader told Mr Trump Thailand agreed in principle to a ceasefire while insisting on the need for ""sincere intention"" from its South East Asian neighbour.

He called for swift bilateral talks to discuss concrete steps toward a peaceful resolution, the ministry said.

But even as hopes for a lasting peace grew, hours later in the early hours of Sunday, each accused the other of shelling targets across the disputed border areas.

In what appeared to be a sign of immediate progress, Malaysia's state news agency, Bernama, quoting Malaysia's foreign minister Mohamad Hasan, said the two leaders will open peace talks in Malaysia on Monday.

The two nations have been at loggerheads over border areas for decades, and simmering tensions escalated into an exchange of gunfire, shelling and rockets on 24 July, with both sides accusing one another of initiating the violence.

Both countries recalled their ambassadors, and Thailand closed its border crossings with Cambodia.

Relations between the pair deteriorated sharply after an armed confrontation in May that killed a Cambodian soldier. Nationalist passions on both sides have further inflamed the situation.

Cambodian authorities reported 12 new deaths on Saturday, bringing its toll to 13, while Thai officials said a soldier was killed, raising the number of deaths to 20 - mostly civilians.

New flashpoints emerged on Saturday more than 100 km (60 miles) from other conflict points along the long-contested border.

There were clashes in the early morning in the neighbouring Thai coastal province of Trat and Cambodia's Pursat Province, both sides said.

Later on Saturday, the US president said that the leaders of both countries had agreed to meet for immediate talks on ending the three-day-long conflict.

Posting on Truth Social while on a state visit to the UK, Mr Trump said he had spoken to Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thailand's acting prime minister Phumtham Wechayachai on ending fighting.

He also threatened to suspend trade agreement talks, and said: ""They are also looking to get back to the 'Trading Table' with the United States, which we think is inappropriate to do until such time as the fighting STOPS.""

Why have tensions escalated?

Clashes before, but this time feels different - analysis

Mr Trump's intervention came after the UN Security Council unanimously called on both sides to show restraint and resolve the dispute peacefully on Friday evening, a council diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity said.

Cambodia's defence ministry said earlier that Thailand had launched ""a deliberate, unprovoked, and unlawful military attack"" but Mr Wechayachai said Bangkok had exercised the ""utmost restraint and patience in the face of [Phnom Penh's] provocations and aggression"".

Cambodia's information minister Neth Pheaktra said on Saturday that the clashes had forced 10,865 Cambodian families - 37,635 people - in three border provinces to evacuate, while Thai officials said more than 131,000 people had fled their border villages.

Villages around Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province were largely deserted, as people loaded their belongings on homemade tractors or sheltered in makeshift underground bunkers, covering them with wood, tarpaulin and zinc sheets to shield themselves from shelling.

Several hundred residents went to a remote Buddhist temple where plastic tents were set up under the trees.

There have been frequent flare-ups along the 500-mile (800 km) frontier the two nations share, and 20 people died in the last serious clashes in 2011.

Tensions rose again in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a skirmish and escalated further when a land mine wounded five Thai soldiers on Wednesday.

The situation grew into a full-blown diplomatic crisis as Bangkok closed the border and expelled the Cambodian ambassador.

Both sides reinforced their troops on the border, and clashes broke out the following day.

150,210,The bitter feud fuelling the border dispute between Thailand and Cambodia,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/26/the-bitter-feud-fuelling-the-border-dispute-between-thailand-and-cambodia,2025-07-26T17:44:28Z,The Guardian,GB,border,"The dispute over Thailand and Cambodia’s contested border, which dates back more than a century to disagreements over colonial-era maps, has broken into conflict before. But the most recent clashes, which erupted on Thursday, have been fuelled by another factor: a bitter feud between two powerful political patriarchs.

Hun Sen, 72, and Thaksin Shinawatra, 76, former leaders of Cambodia and Thailand, were once such close friends they reportedly called one another brothers. Hun Sen has, over the years, supported Thaksin’s family during their long-running power struggle with Thailand’s military. Thaksin and his sister Yingluck stayed at Hun Sen’s home after they were ousted from power, while Hun Sen appointed Thaksin an economic adviser to the Cambodian government. Thaksin frequently visited Cambodia, and Hun Sen was the first foreign guest to see the former Thai leader after he returned home after more than 15 years in self-imposed exile.

But relations have broken down spectacularly over recent months. The exact reasons for their feud are unclear, but analysts say it has created an additional layer of volatility that is exacerbating deadly clashes on the neighbouring countries’ border.

Hun Sen and Thaksin are no longer in office in their respective countries, but both remain powerful. Hun Sen ruled for almost 40 years until 2023, when his eldest son Hun Manet became prime minister after running virtually uncontested in a sham election. Thaksin’s daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra became prime minister last year.

The extent of their falling out became clear last month, when Hun Sen leaked a recording of a phone conversation between himself and Paetongtarn.



In the call, which was about the border dispute, Paetongtarn called Hun Sen “uncle” and told him if there was anything he wanted, she would “take care of it”. She also made disparaging comments about a senior Thai military commander.

The leaked recording caused uproar in Thailand. Critics accused her of kowtowing to Cambodia, putting her family connections before the country’s national interests. She was suspended from office by the constitutional court in July pending an investigation into ethical violations.

It’s not clear why Hun Sen chose to turn on his former friends. He has accused Thaksin of betrayal and threatened to reveal further sensitive information about the Shinawatras. “I never imagined someone so close could act this way,” Thaksin said later, declaring their friendship over.

Some analysts say Hun Sen may be trying to whip up nationalism domestically to increase support for his son, Hun Manet.

Others suggest Hun Sen has been angered by Thailand’s efforts to crack down on so-called “scam compounds” where trafficked workers are held and forced to target people around the world with online scams. This form of lucrative criminal activity has proliferated in the region over recent years, especially in Cambodia.

“The popular narrative in Thailand is that the two men may have had some kind of personal dealings behind the scenes that did not go according to plan and the fallout has spilled over into the realm of national interest,” said Tita Sanglee, associate fellow with ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute.

Whatever his motivations, Hun Sen has succeeded in damaging Thaksin’s position, exploiting divisions between his family and the military, and creating a power vacuum in Thailand.

Hun Sen, meanwhile, “holds near absolute control in Cambodia”, adds Tita. He has stamped out virtually all opposition voices and independent media. “When he chooses to take a strong stance, militarily or politically, it has immediate and direct consequences.”

On Thursday night, Thaksin said he had thanked countries that had offered to mediate the border dispute, but would like to wait, adding: “We need to let the Thai military do their job, and first teach this cunning Hun Sen a lesson.”

Given Thaksin’s weakened position, he may not have a choice but to let the military take the lead.

Last week Thailand downgraded it diplomatic relations with Cambodia, recalling its ambassador, and saying it would expel the country’s envoy in Bangkok.

Thaksin has denied the families’ feud was the cause of the clashes. However awkward questions about his friend turned foe are likely to continue.

As he visited communities sheltering from the conflict in Ubon Ratchathani, in northeastern Thailand, a woman confronted him: “You’re Hun Sen’s friend, aren’t you? Is he your friend? Why do you allow Cambodia to shoot Thai people?”



Solving territorial disagreements is difficult in any context, said Pavin Chachavalpongpun, professor at the Center for Southeast Asian Studies at Kyoto University. “No country would like to sacrifice any inch of sovereignty,” he said. But the personal conflict between Hun Sen and Thaksin has, he added, made their countries’ dispute even more unpredictable.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

153,210,‘Deterrence is boring’: the US troops at sharp end of Trump’s border crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/25/military-mexico-border-immigration,2025-07-25T19:00:32Z,The Guardian,GB,border,"Inside an armored vehicle, an army scout uses a joystick to direct a long-range optical scope toward a man perched atop the US-Mexico border wall cutting across the hills of this Arizona frontier community.

The man lowers himself toward US soil between coils of concertina wire. Shouts ring out, an alert is sounded and a US Customs and Border Protection SUV races toward the wall – warning enough to send the man scrambling back over it, disappearing into Mexico.

The sighting on Tuesday was one of only two for the army infantry unit patrolling this sector of the southern border, where an emergency declaration by Donald Trump has thrust the military into a central role in deterring migrant crossings at US ports of entry.

“Deterrence is actually boring,” said 24-year-old Sgt Ana Harker-Molina, giving voice to the tedium felt by some fellow soldiers over the sporadic sightings. Still, she said she takes pride in the work, knowing that troops discourage crossings by their mere presence.

“Just if we’re sitting here watching the border, it’s helping our country,” said Harker-Molina, an immigrant herself who came from Panama at age 12 and became a US citizen two years ago while serving in the army.

US troop deployments at the border have tripled to 7,600 and include every branch of the military – even as the number of attempted illegal crossings has plummeted and Trump has authorized funding for an additional 3,000 border patrol agents, offering $10,000 signing and retention bonuses.

The military mission is guided from a new command center at a remote army intelligence training base alongside southern Arizona’s Huachuca mountains. There, a community hall has been transformed into a bustling war room of battalion commanders and staff with digital maps pinpointing military camps and movements along the nearly 2,000-mile border.

Until now, border enforcement had been the domain of civilian law enforcement, with the military only intermittently stepping in. But in April, large swaths of the border were designated militarized zones, empowering US troops to apprehend immigrants and others accused of trespassing on army, air force or navy bases, and authorizing additional criminal charges that can mean prison time.

The two-star general leading the mission says troops are being untethered from maintenance and warehouse tasks to work closely with border patrol agents in high-traffic areas for illegal crossings – and to deploy rapidly to remote, unguarded terrain.

“We don’t have a [labor] union, there’s no limit on how many hours we can work in a day, how many shifts we can man,” said Maj Gen Scott Naumann of the army. “I can put soldiers out whenever we need to in order to get after the problem and we can put them out for days at a time; we can fly people into incredibly remote areas now that we see the cartels shifting” course.

At Nogales, army scouts patrolled the border in full battle gear – helmet, M5 service rifle, bullet-resistant vest – with the right to use deadly force if attacked under standing military rules integrated into the border mission. Underfoot, smugglers for decades routinely attempted to tunnel into stormwater drains to ferry contraband into the US.

Naumann’s command post oversees an armada of 117 armored Stryker vehicles, more than 35 helicopters, and a half-dozen long-distance drones that can survey the border day and night with sensors to pinpoint people wandering the desert. Marine Corps engineers are adding concertina wire to slow crossings, as the Trump administration reboots border wall construction.

Naumann said the focus is on stopping “got-aways” who evade authorities to disappear into the US in a race against the clock that can last seconds in urban areas as people vanish into smuggling vehicles, or several days in the dense wetland thickets of the Rio Grande or the vast desert and mountainous wilderness of Arizona.

Meanwhile, the rate of apprehensions at the border has fallen to a 60-year low.

Naumann says the falloff in illegal entries is the “elephant in the room” as the military increases pressure and resources aimed at starving smuggling cartels – including Latin American gangs recently designated as foreign terrorist organizations.

He says it would be wrong to let up, though, and that crossings may rebound with the end of scorching summer weather.

“We’ve got to keep going after it; we’re having some successes, we are trending positively,” he said of the mission with no fixed end date.

The Trump administration is using the military broadly to boost its immigration operations.

“It’s all part of the same strategy that is a very muscular, robust, intimidating, aggressive response to this – to show his base that he was serious about a campaign promise to fix immigration,” said Dan Maurer, a law professor at Ohio Northern University and a retired army judge advocate officer. “It’s both norm-breaking and unusual. It puts the military in a very awkward position.”

The militarized zones at the border sidestep the Posse Comitatus Act, an 1878 law that prohibits the military from conducting civilian law enforcement on US soil.

“It’s in that gray area. It may be a violation – it may not be. The military’s always had the authority to arrest people and detain them on military bases,” said Joshua Kastenberg, a professor at the University of New Mexico School of Law and a former air force judge.

Michael Fisher, a security consultant and former chief of the border patrol from 2010 to 2016, calls the military expansion at the border a “force multiplier” as border patrol agents increasingly turn up far from the border.

“The military allows border patrol to be able to flex into other areas where they typically would not be able to do so,” he said.

At daybreak on Wednesday in Arizona, Spc Luisangel Nito scanned a valley with an infrared scope that highlights body heat, spotting three people as they crossed illegally into the US, in preparation for the border patrol to apprehend them. Nito’s unit also has equipment that can ground small drones used by smugglers to plot entry routes.

Nito is the US-born son of Mexican immigrants who entered the country in the 1990s through the same valleys he now patrols.

“They crossed right here,” he said. “They told me to just be careful because back when they crossed they said it was dangerous.”

Nito’s parents returned to Mexico in 2008 amid the financial crisis, but the soldier saw brighter opportunities in the US, returned and enlisted. He expressed no reservations about his role in detaining undocumented immigrants.

154,210,‘At least here I can’t hear the blasts’: Thai evacuees flee Cambodian border clashes,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jul/25/at-least-here-i-cant-hear-the-blasts-thai-evacuees-flee-cambodian-border-clashes,2025-07-25T16:50:28Z,The Guardian,GB,border,"For almost two months, Maneerat Kote-Bandit had felt on edge, nervous that the tensions simmering on the Thai-Cambodian border might escalate. Everyone in her village, close to the disputed border, had been told to prepare emergency bags in case fighting erupted. “We kept following the news, staying alert and asking: is this the day?”

Still, when the boom of heavy artillery and gunfire echoed through her village on Thursday morning, she was shaken with panic. It was between 8am and 9am when the blasts started. Shortly after, a message was played on a loudspeaker across the village, urging people to get ready to flee.

Maneerat’s nephews, eight and nine, were sent home from school, and the family quickly piled into the back of her pickup truck. From between the houses relatives were shouting “come on, come on” as they raced to leave.

“We were shocked, scared but we had to get ourselves together,” says Maneerat.

The family is now staying near a municipality centre where at least 100 people sleep on bamboo mats under a metal structure.

They are among more than 130,000 people who have been evacuated from their homes in border areas of Thailand, after the deadliest fighting in a decade erupted between Thailand and Cambodia on Thursday.

“There may have been difficult times in the past but not like this,” says In Chanthathep, 72, who is also staying at the centre. She has lived in her village, in Nam Yuen, the southernmost district of Ubon Ratchathani, her whole life, but has never heard fighting so close to her home.

“I just heard a loud noise and I was so panicked,” says In. She didn’t have time to pack anything. “It was so abrupt,” she adds. Her son physically carried her into a car and drove her to the shelter.

It is not especially comfortable, but at least it is safe, she says. She had received some donated clothes and a pillow, and had registered to receive a blanket.

“It’s better than being at home. At least here I can’t hear the blasts. At least here I have peace of mind,” she says.

As she speaks, staff call out the names of people who registered for toiletries or other supplies. At the front of the hall, a TV plays the latest news bulletin, with footage of buildings damaged in artillery fire.

The death toll in Thailand has reached 15, including 14 civilians. In Cambodia, one civilian was killed in Oddar Meanchey province according to a local official. A death toll has not been given by the national government.

Across Det Udom district in Ubon Ratchathani, where In and Maneerat are now staying, about 40 miles (60km) from their homes, more than 60 shelters have been set up in municipality centres, schools and temples. No one is sure how long they will have to stay.

Maneerat just wants everything to return to normal. She works in a flour factory, along with her sisters, but it has been closed due to the clashes. They do not know if they will still be paid.

There will, without doubt, be an economic impact on local people, Maneerat adds. Cambodians and Thai people often cross over the border for business and to trade goods. “If it is mushroom season we go over there to buy some things, and if there’s a season here where we have produce, they will come,” she says. Relations are friendly, and Cambodian neighbours cross so frequently they speak Thai.

Phusita Boottarat, 36, and Kamonwan Homsub, 27, municipality workers who are managing the shelter, are both stunned by how dramatically things have escalated.

When they were schoolchildren they would go on excursions to historic sites at the border. They never thought that one day such tourist spots would become a battleground.

Maneerat doubts the tensions can be resolved through negotiations and a ceasefire. “If they could make a deal in the first place then it wouldn’t have [escalated] into this.” All she can do, she says, is hope.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

About an hour from the border, at Baan Nong Sanom Temple, more than 500 people have spent the night sleeping on the floor.

They rushed from their homes in the early hours, most with only the clothes they were wearing.

Ruehtairat Bula has lived through skirmishes with Cambodia before. But this time feels different, she says.

""This time is more violent. The Cambodian side is using strong weapons. They're dropping rockets into residential areas where civilians live.

""It's killing people, including students.""

Image: Ruehtairat Bula tells Sky News 'it's killing people, including students'

She, like many here, was surprised at the number of civilians killed - at least 15 people have died, while Cambodia says one.

""I'm afraid that this moment will set a precedent,"" she says, her face full of worry.

""Cambodia and Thailand will be more divided and will feel the need to fight every time. And that's scary.""

The youngest evacuee here is just one month old.

Others are in their eighties, frail and in need of medicine they were in too much of a rush to grab when they fled.

Ampan Kongkaew, another evacuee, looks blindsided.

""It all happened too fast. I knew there would be fighting, but I didn't know it would be this quick.

""I couldn't pack my things in time. Everyone here only has the clothes they're wearing. There's elderly and sick people.""

Image: 'I couldn't pack my things in time,' Ampan Kongkaew says

In the border provinces, it's almost a mirror image. People huddled together at makeshift sites, looking dazed and uncertain.

The Cambodian government has accused Thailand of using banned cluster munitions, and officials say seven sites have been hit.

Allies on both sides are calling for peace, but neither Thailand nor Cambodia seem willing to back down just yet.

The fighting follows two months of tensions over contested territory.

But at the heart of this story is a feud between two political titans, two strongmen trying to influence this moment from the sidelines - Cambodia's former leader, Hun Sen and Thailand's former leader, Thaksin Shinawatra.

The test for this region is whether the road to diplomacy will trump the long shadow of political dynasties.

July 29 (UPI) -- Thailand said Tuesday that Cambodia violated their hours-old cease-fire that ended days of fighting between the neighbors over their disputed border.

The cease-fire went into effect at midnight Monday, halting fighting that began Thursday, which caused the deaths of more than 30 people and the displacement of hundreds of thousands.

In a statement Tuesday, Thailand accused Cambodian forces of deliberately violating the cease-fire agreement by attacking several areas within Thai territory. The attacks consisted of weapon fire, which the Royal Thai Army said it responded to in defense.

""It is deeply regrettable that at the designated time, the Thai side continued to detect that the Cambodian side had used weapons to attack Thai territory at multiple points, which constitutes a deliberate violation of the agreement with the intention of destroying the system of mutual trust,"" the Royal Thai army said in a statement.

""The Royal Thai Army therefore condemns such actions, and the Thai side finds it necessary to implement appropriate retaliatory measures under the legitimate right of self-defense.""

Cambodia's military has rejected the accusation, saying it has ""strictly adhered to the orders and agreements under the cease-fire.""

""Cambodia has made a clear and firm commitment to respecting and implementing the terms of the Joint Cease-fire Declaration between the Cambodian and Thai armed forces,"" a spokesperson for Cambodia's Ministry of Defense said in a statement.

The two neighbors have been battling for decades over their disputed border, but tensions spiked earlier this month when five Thai soldiers were injured, including one who lost a leg, due to a landmine within the Thai-Cambodian border region.

Fighting erupted Thursday, with each side blaming the other for firing first.

However, a cease-fire was reached Monday during a meeting in Malaysia that was brokered by the United States with China in attendance.

Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai of Thailand said in a statement that they have lodged a formal protest over Cambodia's alleged violation of the cease-fire agreement with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the United States and China ""to make it clear that cease-fire violations stem from Cambodia's lack of honesty and sincerity.""

""At present, the government has ordered all branches of the military to remain fully deployed in order to uphold Thailand's sovereignty and protect the safety of the people,"" he said. ""Thailand will not allow any infringement on its sovereignty under any circumstances.""

157,204,Thailand and Cambodia ceasefire holds as wary displaced villagers return home,https://apnews.com/article/thailand-cambodia-border-clash-ceasefire-36da6c2ba1a1c33a16ca6ddf1cb82bda,2025-07-29T07:40:30Z,The Associated Press,US,border,"SURIN, Thailand (AP) — A ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia appeared to hold Tuesday as tensions lingered despite a truce agreement to end deadly border clashes following economic pressure from the U.S.

The ceasefire that was reached in Malaysia was supposed to take effect at midnight, but was quickly tested. The Thai army accused Cambodia of launching attacks in multiple areas early Tuesday but Cambodia said there was no firing in any location.

The Thai army later said fighting has stopped after military commanders along the border from both sides met. They agreed to halt troop movements, avoid escalation and establish coordination teams ahead of a joint border committee meeting in Cambodia on Aug. 4, army spokesman Major Gen. Winthai Suvaree said.

Cambodian Defense Minister Tea Seiha said he spoke to his Thai counterpart about “incidents” that occurred during the implementation of the ceasefire but stressed the Cambodian army abided by the truce. He said Cambodian defense officials will lead a delegation of diplomats, foreign military attachés and others to observe the situation.

The Thai government separately said it has lodged complaints to Malaysia, the U.S. and China about Cambodia’s alleged breach of the ceasefire agreement.

Along the border, there were signs of calm with some of the more than 260,000 people displaced by the fighting returning to their homes.

The agreement was made under U.S. pressure

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai had agreed Monday to an “unconditional” halt in fighting that have killed at least 41 people.

The meeting was hosted by Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim as annual chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. He called the ceasefire a “vital first step towards de-escalation and the restoration of peace and security.”

Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. applauded the ceasefire declaration. “President (Donald) Trump and I are committed to an immediate cessation of violence and expect the governments of Cambodia and Thailand to fully honor their commitments to end this conflict,” Rubio said in a statement.

Hun Manet said Tuesday that Trump had called to offer congratulations for the peace move. He posted on social media that Trump pledged the U.S. would join the monitoring process along with Malaysia to ensure the ceasefire is implemented.

Trump also called Phumtham after his return to Bangkok. Phumtham said Trump told him that Thailand’s talks with Washington to negotiate tariff levels on Thai exports could now proceed and that he would seek to make them as favorable as possible.

The ceasefire comes days before the U.S. is expected to announce new trade tariff decisions. Cambodia and Thailand have both been two of the hardest-hit countries as a result of Trump’s trade war, with 36% tariff on goods from both countries taking effect this coming Friday.

Trump had warned that the U.S. might not proceed with trade deals with either country if hostilities continued, giving both sides a face-saving justification for halting the clashes.

Residents along the long-disputed border are wary

Cambodia and Thailand have clashed in the past over their 800-kilometer (500-mile) border. The fighting began Thursday after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Tensions had been growing since May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thailand’s domestic politics.

Residents on both sides of the border expressed relief about the ceasefire but remained wary, unsure how long the peace would last.

“I am very concerned that new fighting may break out. Thailand often provokes the fighting first, but then accuses Cambodia. Their aims is that they want to occupy our temples (along the border). I really don’t want to see any new fighting happen.” said Soklang Slay, as he helped his daughter move back into her home in Cambodia’s Oddar Meanchay province, where heavy fighting had occurred.

Soklang Slay and his family dug a bunker to shield themselves from artillery when fighting started but fled on the second day when bombings intensified.

In Thailand’s Surin province, village chief Kritsada Jindasri said he heard heavy firing and explosions Monday night before silence fell at midnight.

“We are still cautious. We still don’t totally believe (that it would stop). We still wait to assess the situation,” said Kitsada, who had stayed back along with 60 other community leaders after some 400 villagers evacuated last week.

His brother, Jirayu Jindasri, returned home after seeking refuge with relatives. “I still don’t feel comfortable, because they just announced it for the first day. I’m not confident. If it breaks out again, I’ll have to go,” he said.

Analysts said the ceasefire remains tenuous and politically complicated.

Kokthay Eng, a Cambodian researcher in history, politics, and international relations, said Trump’s “trade leverage and strongman mentality have helped save Thai and Cambodian people from further bloodshed.” But he warned that the ceasefire may not last if the Thai government fails to secure lower U.S. tariffs.

“It is risky and will require clear markers to build traction,” said Southeast Asian political expert Bridget Welsh. “A proper border survey should begin immediately. Right now, it’s on pause because the roots of the conflict have yet to be addressed.”

The July 17 incident unfolded in the parking lot of the Home Depot along Florin Road.

Prosecutors with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of California say Customs and Border Protection agents were carrying out an immigration enforcement operation when the suspect – 31-year-old Sacramento resident Jose Manuel Castillo, Jr. – allegedly tried to interfere.

Castilo allegedly refused several commands from officers to move away and was allegedly heard shouting at agents as they were arresting people.

Agents allegedly saw Castillo walk up to the passenger side of a Border Patrol vehicle, then heard a loud hissing noise as he walked away. The tire had a large hole, agents say.

Law enforcement agents say Castillo then ran after being ordered to stop. He was soon caught and searched, with agents allegedly finding a pocket knife in his pocket.

On Monday, the U.S. Attorney's office announced that a charge of depredation of government property had been filed against Castillo.

Castillo had already been released from custody after the incident. His next court date is pending.

Prosecutors say, if convicted, Castillo faces one year in prison and a $100,000 fine.

During the hearing, the Trump administration's attorneys argued that the American Civil Liberties Union, which filed the original federal lawsuit, did not have legal standing to present the case.

""All the court had, really, was a series of declarations from individuals who say they were stopped, or questioned, or arrested, but that does not tell us if the Fourth Amendment was violated in connection with those stops,"" Trump administration attorney Yaakov Roth.

They also denied allegations of racial profiling and told judges they were not aware of deportation quotas.

""They are the ones who are doing categorical determinations,"" ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar said. ""They are the ones who are making stops and arrests without any case-by-case analysis of reasonable suspicion.

On July 11, a judge sided with the ACLU, Los Angeles and immigrant rights groups who argued that federal agents had targeted people based on skin color, performed raids without warrants and denied legal counsel to detainees.

In a statement following the ruling, White House Spokesperson Abigail Jackson called the order a ""gross overstep of judicial authority to be corrected on appeal.""

""No federal judge has the authority to dictate immigration policy – that authority rests with Congress and the President,"" Jackson said. ""Enforcement operations require careful planning and execution; skills far beyond the purview or jurisdiction of any judge.""

Domestically, grievous strategic mistakes have been made. On the foreign stage, however, an approach that Sir Keir likes to style as “quiet, serious diplomacy” has yielded some tangible results.

For the most part, this week’s state visit by Emmanuel Macron further showcased the benefits of leaving behind the blowhard politics of the post-Brexit years. Sir Keir and the French president used the occasion to pledge greater cooperation on security and strengthened their joint commitment to safeguarding Ukraine’s future as a sovereign independent state. But the biggest take-away from Mr Macron’s trip launched the prime minister straight back into toxic domestic terrain.

The announcement of a “one in, one out” migrant returns deal with France represents the government’s most high-profile attempt to halt the Channel crossings, which led last year to a record 86 deaths at sea. In the spirit of a renewed “entente amicale”, Mr Macron has agreed to the automatic return of a small proportion of migrants reaching Britain on small boats. In exchange, the UK will offer safe routes from France for an equivalent number of asylum seekers. The prime minister hopes this agreement can work sufficiently well to be scaled up, acting as a deterrent to those currently willing to risk their lives to reach our shores.

The stakes, both ethically and politically, cannot be overstated. Sir Keir is absolutely right to suggest that Labour must combat the performative outrage of Nigel Farage and Reform – to which he has at times lamentably pandered – with a more humane, “social democratic” response to the Channel crossings. As the Guardian’s reporting has this week underlined, the desperate situation of refugees on the French coast shames political authorities on both sides of the Channel. But whether this week’s deal constitutes such a response is much less clear.

Most obviously, it is difficult to see how a pilot scheme targeting only a very small proportion of arrivals can ever offer “proof of concept” of deterrence. Many migrants using irregular routes, having already risked so much, will surely choose to take their chances as before. The selection procedure for those to be sent back to France is also murky, and returns decisions will almost certainly be subject to legal challenge. Implementation of the plan will ultimately depend on the verdict of the European Commission as to its legality. Italy, Spain and Greece have already made their objections known.

Delay and confusion would only lead to more gruesome headlines for Labour. In one respect though, Sir Keir was justified in describing the scheme as “groundbreaking”. For years, Conservative governments have attempted to stop Channel crossings through devising unjust and unworkable deterrence measures such as the Rwanda scheme. The only result has been a rising toll of human misery.

By agreeing for the first time to expand safe routes to Britain for asylum seekers – albeit on a tiny scale – the prime minister offered a glimpse of a different, more compassionate solution. Going further, in cooperation with countries of origin and European partners, would be the most effective way to undermine the business models of people-smugglers, especially if combined with meaningful levels of aid to the world’s poorest countries. Labour should be focusing more on how it lets refugees in, and less on how it can find new ways to kick them out.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
163,210,"Starmer and Macron to announce ‘one in, one out’ migration deal",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jul/10/starmer-and-macron-to-announce-one-in-one-out-migration-deal,2025-07-10T06:47:53Z,The Guardian,GB,channel crossings,"Keir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron will announce a “one in, one out” migration deal on Thursday that will involve the UK accepting some cross-Channel asylum seekers but returning others to France.

The two leaders are expected to cap the French president’s three-day state visit to the UK with a press conference in London at which they will announce the new plan to tackle small boat crossings.

Officials were still in talks over the details of the plan on Thursday morning, including when it would begin, but other hurdles such as the opposition of other European countries are understood to have been cleared.

The announcement will come at the end of a three-day state visit – the first by a European leader since Brexit – during which the president has met King Charles and given a speech to MPs and peers in parliament’s royal gallery.

On Wednesday, government sources in France and Britain described the negotiations as “complex” and “fluid”, with Downing Street saying it hoped to make “concrete progress” towards a deal.

One French source said the request for extra money to help pay for police on their northern coast was proving “clearly very politically sensitive”.

Under a pilot scheme, the details of which were revealed by Le Monde newspaper on Wednesday, Britain would send back only 2,600 people a year – about 6% of the total number of crossings.

The government has proposed in its immigration white paper to give Border Force officers biometric testing kits to see whether people are working legally in the UK, in an attempt to assuage French concerns about the country’s shadow economy.

Governments have been trying to sign a returns agreement with France for several years to reduce the number of small boats crossing the Channel, though with little success.

Conservative ministers from the previous government say they got close to agreeing one but that the French government remained concerned about how the UK’s shadow economy could attract migrants to work illegally in Britain.

In March 2023, the then immigration minister Robert Jenrick advised the former prime minister Rishi Sunak to sign a deal in which the UK would take “one … or, indeed more than one” asylum seeker for every person returned. This would “quickly break the business model of the smugglers and initial numbers, even if large, would subside”, he argued in a memo.

Labour officials say one reason they have been able to make further progress is because they have dropped the controversial Rwanda scheme. They also cite the relationship between Macron and Starmer as another reason and the government’s action to tackle illegal working.

Britain has also been willing to help fund police on the northern coast of France, signing a £480m deal two years ago to pay for additional border patrols and surveillance equipment such as drones and night-vision binoculars.

But with hours to go until the two leaders were due to make the announcement, negotiators were still arguing over how much the UK would pay to set up the new system, when it would start and what scale it would reach.

The French have recently agreed to intercept boats in the sea which are up to 300 metres from their shore, and are now asking for extra funding to pay for police officers, boats and drones to enforce that policy.

Paris is also understood to be concerned about the possibility of a legal challenge in the French courts against that policy, which officials worry could prove successful.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

A total of 19,982 people made the dangerous crossing from France in small boats between the start of 2025 and Monday, the third highest number of arrivals on a single day so far this year, latest Home Office figures show.

Meanwhile, pictures from the Channel on Tuesday showed more boats crossing, meaning the total between 1 January and 1 July exceeded 20,000 for the first time since data was first collected on migrant crossings in 2018.

19,982 is the highest number for the first half of a calendar year, 48% higher than the figure for the first six months of 2024, (13,489), and 75% higher than 2023's equivalent figure of 11,433.

There were 13 boats that arrived on Monday, carrying an average of around 68 people on each vessel.

The single-day high for this year is 1,195 on 31 May and the overall record is 1,305, on 3 September 2022.

The numbers were ""clearly unacceptable"", the prime minister's spokesman said, putting it down to people smuggling gangs which ""have been allowed to embed industrial-scale smuggling enterprises across Europe"" in recent years.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: ""One year into Labour's government and the boats haven't stopped - they've multiplied.""

Referring to the government's decision to abandon the Conservatives' plan to deport migrants to Rwanda, he added: ""Labour tore up our deterrent and replaced it with fantasy. This is the worst year on record, and it's become a free-for-all.

""We need a removals deterrent so every single illegal immigrant who arrives is removed to a location outside Europe. The crossings will then rapidly stop.""

The Number 10 spokesman said the problem requires ""international solutions and international partnerships"", which is ""what you're seeing"".

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said in May that he has talked to countries about ""return hubs"" for failed asylum seekers as the government is looking at the possibility of processing them in third countries before they are deported.

Councillor Joel Tetlow is under fire after he posted a picture of the Nazi leader on Facebook, overlooking a map of Europe with an apparent reference to small boats crossing the Channel.

A caption on the picture said: ""Why don't we invade them slowly? A few men at a time in small boats.""

Mr Tetlow, who was elected as county councillor for Accrington North on Lancashire County Council last week, then added: ""Let's be grateful this idea was never put to him. Or the world as we know it would be a whole lot different.""

After being approached by Sky News, Mr Tetlow deleted the post. It had been uploaded on Tuesday.

In a statement to Sky News, he said: ""The boats that are coming in on a daily basis of up to 1,000 per day has been happening for the past four years or more, and are showing no signs of abating.

""We do not know who these people are, and I was likening it to an invasion. Just as in Greece they used a wooden horse to sneak into Troy during the Trojan War, disguising their soldiers inside.

""Only yesterday, eight Iranians were arrested looking to attack our country. We just want to protect our great country and the citizens within it. I feel that this post is being taken out of context.""

Mr Tetlow added: ""I had removed the post because even though I know what I meant to say, I had people slating me again and didn't want a repeat of last time.

""I have also received a call from Reform UK who has also asked me to remove it.

""I don't mean any disrespect especially with it being around VE Day, but as I said I likened it more to the Trojan horse coming in small [boats].

Lancashire Council is one of 10 local authorities Reform now controls following last week's local elections, in which they also won the Runcorn by-election from Labour and gained more than 650 new councillors.

Reform leader Mr Farage has used the results to declare his party is now the ""official opposition"" to Labour.

Over the past few months, he has promised to ""professionalise"" the party so it is ready to form the next government - something Mr Farage now believes is possible.

However, questions have been raised about how the party is run internally following the public row with Great Yarmouth MP Rupert Lowe, who was suspended over allegations of ""verbal threats"", which he denies.

169,9,UK launches first sanctions in new strategy to deter migrant crossings,https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2025/07/uk-launches-first-sanctions-new-strategy-deter-migrant-crossings,2025-07-23T04:00:00Z,Al-Monitor,US,channel crossings,"The UK imposed sanctions Wednesday on more than two dozen people, groups and suppliers from the Balkans, the Middle East and China accused of helping migrants cross the Channel.

In what it called a ""landmark"" first use of new powers, the move came as the government faces political pressure to stem migrant arrivals on small boats from northern France, at record levels.

The asset freezes and travel bans announced target individuals and entities ""driving irregular migration to the UK"", and include four ""gangs"" and ""gangland bosses"" operating in the Balkans, the Foreign Office said.

They also hit a small boat supplier in China, so-called ""hawala"" money movers in the Middle East, and seven alleged people-smugglers linked to Iraq.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy called it ""a landmark moment in the government's work to tackle organised immigration crime"" impacting the UK.

""From Europe to Asia we are taking the fight to the people-smugglers who enable irregular migration, targeting them wherever they are in the world,"" he added.

""My message to the gangs who callously risk vulnerable lives for profit is this: we know who you are, and we will work with our partners around the world to hold you to account.""

- 'Terrorising refugees' -

Prime Minister Keir Starmer took office a year ago promising to curb the journeys by ""smashing the gangs"" that facilitate the crossings, but he has struggled to deliver.

Nearly 24,000 migrants have made the perilous journey across the Channel so far in 2025, the highest ever tally at this point in a year.

The issue has become politically perilous in the UK, blamed for helping to fuel the rise of the far-right and violence at anti-migrant demonstrations.

Protests have erupted sporadically outside hotels believed to house asylum-seekers, with a recent demonstration outside one in Epping, east of London, descending into clashes that injured eight police officers.

Riots sparked by the stabbing to death of three young girls in northwestern Southport a year ago also saw suspected asylum-seeker hotels attacked and anti-migrant sentiment on display.

As part of its strategy to curb new arrivals, the government is also cracking down on illegal working, which European neighbours cite as a ""pull factor"" for UK-bound migrants.

It announced late Tuesday a new agreement with delivery firms Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats which includes sharing the locations of asylum hotels to help tackle illegal working.

Meanwhile in another new tactic, artificial intelligence technology will be trialled to assess disputed ages of asylum-seekers who claim to be children, the interior ministry said Tuesday.

- 'Far-fetched' -

Wednesday's designations represent the UK's first use of its new ""Global Irregular Migration Sanctions Regime"".

It claims the regime is a ""world first"", empowering the Foreign Office to target foreign financiers and companies as well as individuals allegedly involved in facilitating people-smuggling to the UK.

In all, it sanctioned 20 individuals, four gangs -- two Balkan groups and two of North African origin operating in the Balkans -- and Chinese firm Weihai Yamar Outdoor Product Co.

It has advertised its small boats online ""explicitly for the purpose of people-smuggling,"" the Foreign Office said.

Among those facing curbs was Bledar Lala, described as an Albanian controlling ""the 'Belgium operations' of an organised criminal group"" involved in the crossings.

The UK also targeted Alen Basil, a former police translator it accused of now leading a large smuggling network in Serbia, ""terrorising refugees, with the aid of corrupt policemen"".

London hit alleged ""gangland boss"" Mohammed Tetwani with sanctions, noting he was dubbed the ""King of Horgos"" over his brutal running of a migrant camp in the Serbian town Horgos.

Author and researcher Tom Keatinge, of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said the sanctions were ""a new front in the UK's efforts to control a business model that brings profit to the enablers"" and misery to victims.

""However, I would caution against overpromising,"" he told AFP. ""Talk of freezing assets and using sanctions to 'smash the gangs' seems far-fetched and remains to be seen.

The warrants will allow the Carroll County deputies to hold a person for up to 48 hours until ICE agents take custody of them.

The sheriff's office says that 12 Central Booking staff members have been trained on how to receive and serve these warrants.

What is an immigration detainer?

According to ICE, an immigration detainer is a request from immigration officials that asks federal, state, or local law enforcement agencies, which include jails, prisons, or other confinement facilities, to ""notify the requesting agency as early as possible before they release a removable alien.""

The detainer will allow the sheriff's office to hold the undocumented migrant for up to 48 hours beyond the time the agency would ordinarily release them so that ICE can take them into custody.

What is an ICE administrative warrant?

Administrative removal warrants are used by ICE officers to arrest non-citizens who have committed immigration violations, according to ICE.

According to the website findlaw.com, administrative warrants, issued by ICE, ""do not grant the legal right to enter a home without consent and are primarily used for arrests in public spaces or individuals already in custody.""

ICE arrest caught on video

In April, a confrontation between a woman and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents in Maryland was captured on video.

The video showed the moment that ICE agents smashed a car window and took 51-year-old Elsy Noemi Berrios into custody in Westminster.

In the video, Berrios can be heard speaking in Spanish to the agents as they stand just outside of her car.

She asks them to explain why she is being arrested and to provide a warrant.

One of the agents responded in Spanish that they didn't need to show an order.

After some inaudible back and forth, Berrios can be heard saying, ""Pues, no me voy a viajar."" She tells the officers that she won't get out of the car.

At that point, the agents break her car window and unlock the car before taking her into custody. The video was taken by Berrios' daughter, Karen Cruz Berrios.

""I would understand if they had a search warrant or anything for her, then okay, you guys can take her out, or give it to her, and she can step out. There was no need for them to do all of that,"" Cruz Berrios said.

In the video, Berrios is heard telling her daughter in Spanish not to worry, to relax, and that she is okay. Crus Berrios calls her mother strong, loving, and a great parent who has done everything she can to support her family.",GNews,-3.03,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.88,"cbs news, CBS, CBS News, cbsnews.com, cbsnews",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cbs-news/,https://ground.news/interest/cbs-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cbs-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,CBS Corporation,1927,-1.5,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,cbsnews.com,,cbs news,21,USA,Y,G,CBS News,Y
15,35,Judge says Justice Department failed to make case for Abrego Garcia’s detention ahead of criminal trial,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/22/politics/abrego-garcia-detention-trial,2025-06-22T04:00:00Z,Cable News Network,US,immigration,"CNN —

A judge in Tennessee said the Justice Department hasn’t made a convincing case that Kilmar Abrego Garcia should be kept in pretrial detention, though the mistakenly deported man who was returned to the US is likely to remain in federal immigration custody regardless.

Abrego Garcia is being held in Tennessee as he faces a federal indictment of smuggling undocumented immigrants across state lines in 2022. The US returned him from El Salvador this month after the indictment was unsealed, ending a political standoff over his due process rights.

His court proceedings have become a vessel for the Trump Justice Department’s hardball approach to immigration enforcement in which it has sought to portray Abrego Garcia as part of a gang operation in Maryland.

But as she ruled in Abrego Garcia’s favor, Magistrate Judge Barbara Holmes of the federal court in Nashville said Sunday that “the government failed to prove” so far that he endangered any minor victim, might try to flee from the law or might attempt to obstruct justice, as the Justice Department had argued. She noted that under federal criminal law, the Justice Department hadn’t even shown it had enough evidence to hold a hearing seeking his pretrial detention.

Still, Abrego Garcia is likely to remain in federal custody, because immigration authorities will be able to keep him detained separate from his criminal case. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges.

Holmes’ opinion is still a notable one, building upon six hours of evidence and testimony regarding Abrego Garcia’s detention earlier this month, in what amounted to a preview of what may be evidence used at a trial.

Holmes’ 51-page ruling essentially deems some DOJ accusations about Abrego Garcia to be overblown — built upon evidence with questionable reliability from a traffic stop, cooperators in the case providing information to law enforcement through hearsay, and a shaky theory of victimizing children in a human-smuggling operation when that has not been charged or proved by the DOJ, the judge wrote.

Attorney General Pam Bondi and the prosecutor in the case, Robert McGuire, had emphasized how smuggling operations could be dangerous affairs. The danger, the Justice Department argued, stretched from putting adults and children at risk while traveling in packed vehicles, potentially without seat belts, to how the transport of migrants could connect to gang membership in the US.

“There is no dispute the offenses of which Abrego is charged are not crimes against children and the involvement of a minor child is not an element of the charged offenses,” Holmes wrote Sunday.

And, she wrote, “the government cannot simply rely on the general reputation of a particular street gang” to argue Abrego Garcia may be dangerous if he has ties to the group MS-13, as the Justice Department had argued, citing the beliefs of cooperators facing their own charges and deportations.

The Justice Department has already appealed the magistrate judge’s decision.

A senior DOJ official, speaking to CNN, downplayed the significance of the loss in court Sunday and noted it is coming from a magistrate judge. The administration is optimistic it will have a better chance with a federal district court judge but will not be deterred in pursuing the criminal case against Abrego if early appeals do not go its way, the official said.

Holmes has set another hearing for Wednesday in Nashville to discuss Abrego Garcia’s release conditions.

Responding to the opinion, Abrego Garcia’s defense attorney Sean Hecker said, “We are pleased by the Court’s thoughtful analysis and its express recognition that Mr. Abrego Garcia is entitled both to due process and the presumption of innocence, both of which our government has worked quite hard to deny him.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security, said Sunday on X that “Kilmar Abrego Garcia is a dangerous criminal illegal alien. We have said it for months and it remains true to this day: he will never go free on American soil.“

A politicized case

Abrego Garcia was returned to the US this month to face the charges after he was mistakenly deported to El Salvador three months before. He has pleaded not guilty to federal charges of human smuggling related to a 2022 traffic stop in which he drove a Chevrolet Suburban with nine Hispanic male passengers through Tennessee. Justice Department prosecutors allege Abrego Garcia transported undocumented people in the US on more than 100 trips between Texas, Maryland and other states.

Prosecutors say over several years, Abrego Garcia “operated in the illicit world of an international smuggling ring.”

But according to legal filings, evidence and statements from prosecutors in the case so far, the man was a cog in a larger alleged scheme of transporting undocumented immigrants from Texas to Maryland for profit.

Separately, Abrego Garcia’s mistaken deportation had caused a political crisis for the Trump administration. Courts had ordered the federal government to “facilitate” Abrego Garcia’s return from El Salvador this spring because he had been mistakenly sent there. Yet the administration didn’t bring him back for weeks, until a grand jury handed up its indictment in late May.

In a separate federal court proceeding in Maryland, Abrego Garcia’s attorneys are arguing for Trump administration officials to be sanctioned because of their handling of his deportation and the lack of information they provided to his legal team following multiple court orders while he was imprisoned in El Salvador.

The government deported the father of three in mid-March, violating a 2019 court order that barred his removal to El Salvador because of fears that he would face gang violence there.

172,257,"The UK’s extreme new immigration plans, explained",https://www.vox.com/2023/3/11/23634575/uk-immigration-bill-braverman-sunak-boats-channel,2023-03-11T22:43:00Z,Vox.com,US,channel crossings,"Facing an increase in migration across the English Channel, the UK agreed to fund additional policing and a new migrant detention center in northern France on Friday, to the tune of $576 million over three years. The deal, which builds on previous agreements between the UK and France, is the latest step by Britain’s right-wing government to combat immigration and a sign of the Conservative Party’s increasing desperation on the issue.

After the number of migrants entering the UK by crossing the Channel exploded in 2020, climbing from just 300 people to 8,500 in just two years, it reached new heights in 2022 with 45,000 new arrivals. In response, not only is the UK stepping up cooperation with France on immigration, but British Home Secretary Suella Braverman introduced a draconian new bill this week that would refuse the right to asylum to people arriving via irregular migration.

Under the terms of the new agreement, announced Friday at a UK-France summit in Paris, the UK will fund a new migrant detention center in France and an increased French police presence in the English Channel to intercept attempted crossings via boat. France is expected to contribute funding to the enforcement efforts as well, but the French government has not yet released those details.

“The level of ambition of this plan is exactly what we need,” French President Emmanuel Macron said of the deal, emphasizing that “this is not an agreement between UK and France but between UK and EU.”

Braverman’s bill, meanwhile, which was introduced in the House of Commons on March 7 and has yet to face a vote, would deport people who arrive to the UK via irregular migration channels — primarily small boats crossing the English Channel — and bar them from seeking asylum in the UK. The bill has been widely criticized as racist and legally fraught, and both the UN’s refugee agency and the European Court of Human Rights have objected on human rights grounds.

As described by Prime Minister Rishi Sunak on Twitter, the bill, if passed, would not only prevent asylum claims, it would shut undocumented immigrants out of the UK’s modern slavery protections, which provide support for victims of modern slavery and a framework to crack down on perpetrators.

“Most people fleeing war and persecution are simply unable to access the required passports and visas,” the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights said in a statement responding to the bill’s announcement. “There are no safe and ‘legal’ routes available to them. Denying them access to asylum on this basis undermines the very purpose for which the Refugee Convention was established.”

Migrants arriving in small boats — many from Albania, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, and Syria, according to the Associated Press — are often those with the least access to conventional, safe routes to asylum. But the UK’s legal asylum system is overwhelmed, too, according to the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, with a backlog of more than 100,000 cases affecting nearly 150,000 people, some of whom are applying with family members.

Sunak’s plan comes as the UK attempts to iron out its post-Brexit relationship with the European Union, and France in particular, after a blowup over a defense pact between Australia, the US, and the UK, which France saw as a betrayal. France had resisted the UK’s proposal to return migrants to France and have them claim asylum in the first safe country they enter, insisting that such a policy couldn’t be decided bilaterally and must be a decision between the UK and the EU.

Should Sunak’s plan and Braverman’s proposal fail to address the number of people coming to the UK via irregular channels, some Conservative members of Parliament are insisting the UK withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees people the right to access asylum procedures and prevents countries from sending migrants back to countries where their lives are at risk or they would be subject to torture.

The new plans won’t fix the UK’s immigration system

It’s far from clear, however, that the Conservative bill will significantly curb migration to the UK. According to Peter William Walsh, senior researcher with the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, “to date, there is surprisingly little evidence that asylum deterrence policies put people off in large numbers, for the simple reason that asylum seekers often have little understanding of what policies will face them after they arrive.”

As Sunder Katwala, head of the think tank British Future, told the Guardian’s Hannah Moore, the number of boat crossings picked up during the Covid-19 pandemic because other methods of travel weren’t available. Now, channel crossings “are an established and institutionalized route,” Katwala said. The best available option for these migrants is to pay a smuggler or group of smugglers to take them across the English Channel in unsafe and sometimes deadly voyages to try to claim asylum in the UK or find under-the-table employment opportunities.

Braverman’s proposal hinges on the idea that they can simply be deported, taken elsewhere, or detained. But that’s a fairly simplistic premise, Walsh said, and one that might not stand up to reality.

“On paper, the bill effectively opts the UK out of the global asylum system as we know it, by preventing people from claiming asylum if they arrived through irregular routes,” he told Vox via email. “But when these people can’t be removed because there is nowhere for them to go (and this is expected to be the case for most asylum seekers arriving by small boat), what happens to them? On the face of it, the bill appears to leave them permanently in the UK with no rights, financially dependent on the state because they would not have the right to work.”

Sunak has pledged to cut backlogs in the UK immigration system by “radically re-engineering the end-to-end process, with shorter guidance, fewer interviews and less paperwork,” and “introducing specialist caseworkers by nationality,” as well as doubling the number of case workers focused on asylum claims, which numbered around 117,000 applications awaiting an initial decision from the Home Office as of September 2022, according to the Migration Observatory.

The Tories have a track record of extreme immigration policies

The new immigration measures are not the first hardline proposals from the Tory government; they’re just the latest in a series of increasingly drastic immigration measures pushed by Sunak’s Conservative Party.

Last April, the government put into place a program to deport irregular asylum seekers to Rwanda to apply for asylum there. That plan, introduced under then-Home Secretary Priti Patel, was deemed legal by the UK’s High Court; however, the European Court for Human Rights intervened and prevented the first flight of migrants from taking off for Rwanda last June, and no migrants have been sent to Rwanda under the plan.

Braverman took over Patel’s position, first under former Prime Minister Liz Truss and then again under Sunak, and took up the torch for the Rwanda plan, although she conceded that it wouldn’t happen “for a long time.”

The legality of that measure is currently being debated in court, but “even if the proposed Rwanda scheme gets up and running, this barely changes the picture because capacity in Rwanda is low,” Walsh said.

Ultimately, Walsh tells Vox that as draconian as the bill is, it’s fundamentally also “a gamble: that the UK won’t actually need to impose this penalty on many people because the deterrent effect will be so strong.”

That’s something of an untested proposition, though. As Walsh told Vox, there’s no way to tell how effective the policies will be, “since they are more extreme than policies adopted in most other high-income countries where the evidence comes from.” And in the US, immigration policies such as Title 42 have done little to slow the pace of arrests at the southern border, which were reported at a record high in 2022.

If Braverman’s bill passes and “people continue to arrive in the UK by small boat in substantial numbers, not being able to process and resolve their asylum claims could create considerable operational chaos and financial costs,” Walsh said.

Despite the potential problems, however, recent polling shows that small boat migration is a priority for a crucial constituency: Brits who voted Tory in 2019. According to a new poll by Public First for Universities UK, stopping illegal migration via small boats has become the second-most important issue for these voters — more important than reducing wait times for surgeries with the National Health Service. That polling also indicates voters are less concerned about legal migration and fixing the immigration system, which could help explain the extreme proposals Sunak’s government is pushing, without corresponding investment into the immigration system.

After 12 years in power, the Tories are at a low point; in a recent YouGov poll, only 17 percent of respondents said they’d vote Conservative if there were a snap election, compared to 30 percent who said they’d vote Labour. As such, recapturing people who voted in a landslide for Boris Johnson to “get Brexit done” is undoubtedly a priority for British Conservatives after the troubled tenures of Johnson, who stepped down after investigations into his administration’s flouting of Covid-19 restrictions, and Truss, whose administration lasted only six weeks.",GNews,-10.01,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,39.65,"vox.com, Vox, Vox Media, vox.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/vox/,https://ground.news/interest/vox,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/vox-news-media-bias,LEFT (-6.4),HIGH (1.9),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Left,Vox Media,2014,-3.5,Left,High,Left,Left,Lean Left,Left,Left,vox.com,vox.com,vox.com,50,USA,,,,

A day after Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced plans to combat such crossings, the authorities were initially alerted to reports of a small boat in distress in the Channel around 3:05 a.m., and began a coordinated search-and-rescue operation led by the coast guard, according to a statement from the British Home Office.

Harrowing images taken from aboard a fishing vessel that was among the first to respond to the scene and shared with British news outlets showed the boat pulled up alongside a partially deflated dinghy, as a number of people, some wearing life vests, cling precariously to ropes on the side of the vessel.

18,35,The Dodgers were about to break their silence on Trump’s immigration crackdown. Then federal agents showed up,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/20/sport/los-angeles-dodgers-immigration-spt,2025-06-20T10:30:03Z,Cable News Network,US,immigration,"Los Angeles CNN —

After about two weeks of building public pressure for the Los Angeles Dodgers to speak out against immigration raids throughout the metro area, the team announced on Friday a partnership with the city to commit $1 million to assist families of impacted immigrants – a statement that was delayed by one day after dozens of federal law enforcement showed up just outside the vast parking lot surrounding Dodger stadium.

As one of the City of Angels’ first major professional sports teams, the Dodgers are a cornerstone of Southern California culture. Their interlocking LA logo is as iconic as the Hollywood sign, recognized around the world and worn as a symbol of pride by millions of Angelenos.

In times of crisis, teams like the Dodgers are usually a rallying point – a unifying force in moments of struggle. But over the last few weeks, as major protests popped up in Los Angeles in response to increased immigration raids by the Trump administration in the Southern California area, the Dodgers became a target of local ire. It was a tough demotion from being the subject of local adoration just months ago during a World Series championship parade.

On June 6, raids outside a Home Depot and an apparel warehouse in Los Angeles set off days of protests and, on some nights, clashes between demonstrators and law enforcement. President Donald Trump on June 7 deployed National Guard troops to the city to “temporarily protect ICE” – the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement – “and other United States Government personnel who are performing Federal functions” and to protect federal property, according to a memo – overriding California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the move a “brazen abuse of power.”

Families have been split, people were arrested by plain-clothes agents wearing masks and hats and Trump and his administration reveled in the chance to clash with Democratic politicians. As fear spread throughout Los Angeles, many of the city’s institutions spoke up to defend the undocumented immigrants and asylum seekers who were being picked up by the federal government.

But not the Dodgers. The team – whose stadium itself is part of the long story of the Latino experience in Los Angeles, given the land on which it sits was once home to a Mexican-American neighborhood that fought for years against being displaced – was publicly quiet for two weeks about the tension gripping its city.

The silence infuriated many members of the fanbase, who felt abandoned by their team.

“I just feel like the organization, as a whole, needed to say something. The fanbase is predominantly Latinos, and we have been supporting them forever,” said Amanda Carrera, a Dodgers fan who was demonstrating outside of Dodger Stadium on Thursday.

On Wednesday night, the Los Angeles Times reported that the team would be breaking that silence with a plan to support immigrant communities in the city.

A few dozen people were also protesting as the Dodgers played the San Diego Padres. They shouted to keep “ICE out of LA” and “ICE out of Dodger Stadium.” Many expressed anger toward the Dodger organization for remaining silent on the issue plaguing a core part of their fanbase. “And so why should we keep supporting them if they don’t support us?” Carrera asked. “And, as heartbreaking as it sounds, it’s like we love our team so much and it just feels like they don’t love us.”

A strange day in Chavez Ravine

It was against that backdrop that federal law enforcement arrived just outside the vast Dodger Stadium parking lot on Thursday morning.

Reports began to circulate that federal agents were present at the stadium outside downtown LA, sparking concerns the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown was coming to the home of the World Series champions hours before a game against the San Diego Padres. Protesters rushed to the area and began chanting anti-ICE slogans at the federal agents.

In the team’s telling, agents from ICE arrived at Dodger Stadium and asked for permission to access the parking lots. The Dodgers said no.

The Trump administration’s version of what happened is quite different. US Customs and Border Protection vehicles were in a parking lot on the grounds, and one of them had a car malfunction that caused them to stay longer, according to an official who maintained there were no operations related to the MLB franchise.

The ICE account on X even called out the Dodgers directly, saying their post was false.

“We were never there,” the post read.

There has been an influx of CBP agents in the Los Angeles area on the heels of the protests against Trump’s immigration enforcement agenda. The Department of Homeland Security surged agency personnel to the region, including border agents, to respond to those protests and many have remained in the area.

“This had nothing to do with the Dodgers. CBP vehicles were in the stadium parking lot very briefly, unrelated to any operation or enforcement,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

An Echo Park Rapid Response community activist, who did not want to be named, told CNN that early Thursday morning, members of the community signaled “what they called a really heavy ICE presence at the Home Depot in Hollywood,” so they headed that way.

The activist said they saw two people being detained at a Home Depot and followed the vehicles in which the detainees were taken away to near Dodger Stadium.

They saw a CBP agent, the activist said, whom they had also seen and spoken to at the Home Depot. “I asked what they were doing. He responded they bring the detainees there (near Dodger Stadium) to process them,” the activist said. “They conduct their investigation there without public interference, (…) that they can’t do it in the Home Depot parking lot because the public makes it too dangerous.”

CNN has contacted CBP and ICE for clarification regarding the community member’s description of events.

Another activist in the area, Chelsea Kirk, followed what she believed to be ICE vans from the Home Depot to Dodger Stadium’s Gate A entrance. She later followed them to a second entry point at Gate E, where the unmarked vans and agents in tactical gear remained for a few more hours.

Protesters gathered at Gate E before dispersing in the early afternoon. Demonstrators gathered again in the early evening to protest outside Gate A, as the Dodgers played the San Diego Padres. They shouted to keep “ICE out of LA” and “ICE out of Dodger Stadium.” Many expressed anger toward the Dodger organization for remaining silent on the issue plaguing a core part of their fanbase.

“Why should we keep supporting them if they don’t support us?” Carrera asked. “And, as heartbreaking as it sounds, it’s like we love our team so much and it just feels like they don’t love us.”

With the attention on the presence of federal agents Thursday, the original plan for the Dodgers to announce support for the immigrant community was delayed.

Dodgers President Stan Kasten said Thursday that the delay was “because of the events earlier today,” the Los Angeles Times reported.

Frustration and fear run deep in LA

No matter the agency or their purpose, the appearance of federal agents at Dodger Stadium is enough to create a high-profile event, given the atmosphere gripping Los Angeles.

Some businesses have been closing early, with more customers staying home. As the school year wound down, some students wept openly in class, worried about the future of their families. Relatives stayed away from graduation ceremonies, while some nannies chose to stay close to their employers’ homes, only taking the children around the block instead of public parks.

Rumors of where ICE will be or how it will be meeting the White House’s demands for more arrests have been rife, not just in LA but around the country. With the FIFA Club World Cup attracting soccer fans to stadiums throughout the US, there have been worries federal agents could target people coming to the games.

So, when reports of federal agents being outside Dodger Stadium began to circulate on Thursday, protesters flocked to the team’s complex just outside of downtown Los Angeles. Images from the parking lot outside the stadium showed a line of police blocking protesters from being near the large group of unmarked federal law enforcement vehicles that had gathered in the stadium’s expansive concrete apron.

With the White House expecting ICE to arrest 3,000 people per day and Los Angeles-area officials telling the public they don’t have any idea where federal agents will pop up next, the entire area is on edge.

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said during a news conference Friday the agents didn’t provide any identification, so they aren’t sure who they are or what they were doing.

“We’re not sure who these armed men are,” she said. “They show up without uniforms, they show up completely masked, they refuse to give ID, they are driving regular cars with tinted windows, and in some cases out of state license plates. Who are these people? And frankly, the vests they have on looked like they ordered them from Amazon.”

Carerra said she’s organizing a protest later this week and she hears mixed things about whether people actually want to be in public.

“The community has voted to protest. They want to come out and do it, but I think that there is the other half that’s scared,” she said.

“It’s scary when you see images and videos of people being kidnapped. You know, I mean, ICE agents, unmarked vehicles, masks covering their face. … We don’t even know who to trust. We don’t know, like, are these actually, actual agents or not, you know? So, there’s a lot of fear. It’s horrible. It’s so just heartbreaking.”

The tension meant many fans lashed out at the Dodgers for not having done more to express support for their fans, many of whom are Latino. The replies to the Dodgers’ X account were full of fans demanding the team say something condemning the federal government’s actions or – at the very least – express support for the immigrant community in LA.

Vice President JD Vance traveled Friday to Los Angeles, where he toured a multiagency Federal Joint Operations Center before meeting with leadership and Marines. While speaking with the press, Vance defended the administration’s controversial use of the California National Guard in Los Angeles after a federal appeals court allowed President Donald Trump to maintain control over thousands of guardsmen.

“That determination was legitimate, and the president’s going to do it again if he has to, but hopefully it won’t be necessary,” Vance said.

The vice president is the highest-ranking administration official to travel to Los Angeles since protests roiled the city following ICE raids and troop deployments earlier this month.

Fans demand more from the Dodgers

As the Dodgers delayed their announcement, Al Aguilar stood outside Dodger Stadium with a sign that read “Los Doyers Silent? Silent” on Thursday afternoon. He said the team’s history in LA should make it more understanding of the pressure on the community.

He said the Dodgers buying the Chavez Ravine land at a discounted price and the eviction of the final families remaining on the land came with the stipulation the stadium would be used for the community. He said Latinos largely stayed away from the team until Fernandomania – the debut of Dodger legend Fernando Valenzuela and his subsequent success – in 1981 made fans for life.

That history isn’t forgotten today, he said.

“Nothing was said. They were silent about the issues going on, not even taking sides. They could say, ‘We believe in equal rights, constitutional rights, due process,’ without taking sides, just those things, but they didn’t say anything,” Aguilar told CNN.

He added, “With the amount of Latin American players that they have, with the community being behind them all these years, being (forgiven) – if you were thrown out of your houses and dragged out for a sports franchise that interrupted the community, you might have feelings about that.”

When singer Nezza performed the National Anthem ahead of a game last weekend, as “No Kings” protests were taking place around the nation and LA was enduring another weekend of protests, she decided to do so in Spanish. What sparked more outrage against the Dodgers was the fact that she said a Dodgers employee specifically asked her not to.

“I didn’t really see an issue with it and I wanted people to know that I’m with them and I’m standing by them,” Nezza told CNN on Tuesday.

An unidentified person, who Nezza says is a Dodgers employee, can be heard on a video saying to the singer, “We are going to do the song in English today, so I’m not sure if that wasn’t relayed.”

Following her performance, the Dodgers employee – who she would not name – called Nezza’s manager almost immediately and told them to never call or email them again, and their client was not welcome back, according to the singer.

The Dodgers have said publicly there are “no consequences or hard feelings” regarding her performance and she is not banned from – and is welcome to return to – the stadium.

Nezza, whose parents are both immigrants, said she hasn’t been contacted by the team and doesn’t plan on attending the stadium again.

“I don’t feel welcome to come back,” she said.

Carerra said that attitude from the team confused and angered many fans.

“That’s kind of what’s been the confusion because they have spoken out against or regarding other social issues before,” she told CNN. “They’ve made statements before about things, and so, you know, the fact that it’s taking them this long is just, it’s very confusing, and it hurts.”

‘Can we even trust them?’

Frustration with the Dodgers could ease among fans after Thursday’s confrontation with the Trump administration and the club’s new pledge of support for immigrant families.

Gary Lee, the founder of DodgersNation.com, said silence is the Dodgers’ “default position” on the immigration crackdown, but the announcement by the team on how it plans to assist immigrants in the area was a relief.

“The Dodgers have arguably been more culturally influential to the city of Los Angeles” than other sports franchises, Lee said, “so there seems to be more responsibility to the community on their shoulders than any other franchise, including the Lakers.”

While the planned announcement didn’t immediately materialize after Thursday’s incident with federal agents, the Dodgers on Friday ended up announcing “$1 million toward direct financial assistance for families of immigrants impacted by recent events in the region” with “additional announcements with local community and labor organizations” to be shared in the coming days.

“What’s happening in Los Angeles has reverberated among thousands upon thousands of people, and we have heard the calls for us to take a leading role on behalf of those affected,” Kasten, the Dodgers president, said Friday. “We believe that by committing resources and taking action, we will continue to support and uplift the communities of Greater Los Angeles.”

Part of the calls for action came from more than 50 Los Angeles leaders who wrote an open letter asking the team to denounce ICE raids.

In response to the Friday announcement, Reverend Zach Hoover, Executive Director of LA Voice, federation of PICO California, said, “The Dodgers have taken a meaningful step toward addressing the fear in our communities. By committing real resources to immigrant families, they’re showing that moral courage and civic leadership still matter in Los Angeles, and that we can heal the wounds of hate with the power of love. We pray this is just the beginning—because dignity demands more than silence, and faith calls us to act.”

But for some fans, the damage is done regardless of what the team says. Carerra told CNN the amount of public pressure on the Dodgers has her questioning the team in ways she never would have before. Regardless of the Dodgers’ statement of support or whether or not the club really threw federal agents off Dodger Stadium property on Thursday, she’s wondering if it’s all a public relations move.

“It’s like, can we even trust them? Like, can we trust them up to this point that what they’re doing isn’t just to kind of, you know, protect themselves, and that sucks. I hate that it has to get to this point,” she said.

32,35,Migrant families describe prolonged detention in border facilities,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/06/17/politics/migrant-families-children-detention,2025-06-18T00:57:49Z,Cable News Network,US,migrant,"CNN —

Migrant families with young children, including toddlers, were held for days and sometimes weeks in US Customs and Border Protection facilities, some with jail-like conditions, according to interviews conducted by attorneys tied to immigrant advocacy groups and submitted Tuesday in federal court.

The filings reveal details of families being detained this year in border facilities, which are not designed for that purpose, for extended periods of time despite a steep drop in migrant crossings, raising alarm among attorneys who argue CBP detention is not equipped to care for people, especially children.

The court filings are part of a decades-old legal agreement governing conditions for migrant children in government custody. Tuesday’s motion requests that CBP stop detaining children for prolonged periods of time in poor conditions and requests more precise data from the agency after recent discrepancies.

“During their extended detention, CBP holds children in increasingly harsh conditions, including in ports of entry (‘POE’), which are meant to hold individuals for only a few hours, in violation of (the settlement). Children are particularly vulnerable to the trauma caused by the confusion, cruelty, and deprivation endemic to CBP custody,” the motion reads.

The 1997 Flores settlement, as it’s known, requires the government to release children from government custody without unnecessary delay to sponsors, such as parents or adult relatives, and dictates conditions by which children are held. It applies to children who crossed the US-Mexico border alone, as well as those who arrived with family.

Attorneys who represent the Flores settlement class are permitted to meet with children and their family members in government custody to interview them.

In one case, a mother and her toddler, separated from her father, were held at a border facility in California for 42 days, according to the family’s telling in a court declaration. The officers allowed the father to visit two times.

“Since being separated from her father, (redacted)’s behavior has changed. She used to speak a lot before, and now she’s not speaking anymore. She previously used five or six words, like ‘mom’ ‘dad’ and ‘yes,’ now she doesn’t talk at all,” the filing states, detailing a room where 23 women and children were held with no windows.

“It was so crowded that we couldn’t even step forwards or backwards,” the declaration says. “We spent all 42 days in that same place. We didn’t see the daylight. We only went outside when we went to the different place where the showers are.”

CNN has reached out to CBP for comment.

The Flores settlement agreement doesn’t prohibit the federal government from deporting a child and their family, but it states that children can’t be kept in immigration detention for prolonged periods and should be considered for release.

According to Tuesday’s filings, “Instead, CBP keeps accompanied children in its custody until it removes them from the United States or transfers them to ICE custody where they can request parole from ICE.”

Attorneys found that even though migrant crossings have plummeted at the US southern border, 301 children were detained in CBP custody for more than 72 hours in February. Of those, the majority were detained for more than seven days.

In April, when US Border Patrol encounters hovered around 8,300, 213 children were held more than 72 hours and 14 children were held for more than 20 days, including toddlers, according to the filing. The data is based on reports provided by CBP.

“The number of children crossing our borders is the lowest in decades, but the cruelty they are experiencing in government custody is at an all-time high,” said Leecia Welch, deputy litigation director at Children’s Rights, who interviewed some of the families and children in custody.

“We are heaping trauma on defenseless children who came here seeking our protection. With this motion, we return to court once again asking for nothing more than government accountability to ensure the humane treatment of children,” she added.

Previous administrations, including the Biden administration, wrestled with border surges that strained federal resources and resulted in unaccompanied children, families and adults staying in border custody for days. Border facilities are intended for relatively short stays.

CBP generally releases or transfers those in custody within 72 hours as a matter of practice, though that can often be extended in the event of space limitations for transfers to other agencies, such as Immigration and Customs Enforcement. In the past, CBP has also paroled people into the United States on a case-by-case basis, depending on the individual or family circumstance.

The Trump administration has moved to terminate the Flores settlement, arguing that it has hamstrung the federal government’s policymaking and ability to respond to changing conditions along the border, including surges in recent years.

“The Executive has not been able to react fully and meaningfully to these changes because the (Flores settlement agreement) has ossified federal-immigration policy,” the Trump Justice Department said in a recent court filing. “Successive Administrations have tried unsuccessfully to free themselves from the strictures of the consent decree and this Court’s gloss on it. But detention of juvenile aliens continues to be—as it has been for more than a generation—dominated by the strictures of a 1997 agreement.”

But the combination of low border numbers and extended stays in CBP facilities has raised questions for attorneys, including whether some people are coming into CBP facilities from interior enforcement actions.

“The lengths in detention are lengthening despite the requirements of Flores and CBP policies and practices themselves. We’re seeing a broader variety of troubling sites being put into play,” said Sergio Perez, executive director of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law and part of the Flores legal team.

A family with a 5-year-old son was taken into custody after a traffic stop in Ohio. The parent and child were taken to an office building in the state where they stayed in a room for five days, according to a court declaration.

“The room had no windows to the outside. We couldn’t tell whether it was day or night. There was a large window that looked out on the office space and agents working on their computers. All the agents were men,” the declaration states.

“The room had a toilet that was completely visible to anyone walking by the room. We could only go pee because it was so uncomfortable to go to the bathroom within the view of all those men,” it continues, adding that lights were left on at night.

In another case, an 11-year-old and their mother were apprehended when they landed in the United States. They were held at O’Hare International Airport for five days, according to a court declaration.

The filings include descriptions from migrants of border facilities with cold rooms, limited access to sanitary items, thin mattresses on the floor, mylar blankets, and limited or no access to the outdoors. The filings also include allegations that CBP officers used profanity, and in one case, told children to “go home” when they asked for food.

One family with two sons, including a 1-year-old and an infant who’s only a “few months,” was detained in a border facility for a month.

“It was extremely cold. My sons both got sick there because it was so cold. They did not allow us extra clothes for the kids. We had only aluminum blankets,” the declaration reads, adding: “The lights were on all night, they never turned off. We spent these days inside without even seeing the sun.”",GNews,-6.23,,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnn-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.09,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/,https://ground.news/interest/cnn,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.7),USA,,TV Station/Website,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Turner Broadcasting System,1980,-1.3,Lean Left,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,edition.cnn.com,,cable news network,57,USA,Y,F,CNN,Y
176,9,"France, UK sign new deal to thwart migrant Channel crossings",https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2022/11/france-uk-sign-new-deal-thwarting-migrant-channel-crossings,2022-11-14T07:50:31Z,Al-Monitor,US,channel crossings,"Britain agreed to pay France another 72.2 million euros ($74.5 million) to prevent migrant boat crossings under a new deal signed on Monday that underlines improving ties between the neighbours.

Around 40,000 people -- most of them Albanians, Iranians and Afghans -- have crossed the Channel to England from France this year.

The figure is well over last year's 28,561, which was a thousand-fold increase from 2018 when migrants and asylum seekers first began sailing inflatables across one of the world's busiest shipping channels.

""There are no quick fixes, but this new arrangement will mean we can significantly increase the number of French gendarmes patrolling the beaches in northern France,"" Britain's Home Secretary Suella Braverman said in a statement after signing the accord with French counterpart Gerald Darmanin.

The extra money will fund a 40-percent rise in the number of security forces patrolling France's northern beaches, meaning an additional 350 people, the French interior ministry said.

For the first time, teams of observers will be deployed on both sides of the Channel to ""strengthen common understanding"".

""The arrangement means, for the first time, specialist UK officers will also be embedded with their French counterparts,"" the British interior ministry said.

- Tensions -

Successive British governments have paid France hundreds of millions of euros over the past decade to improve border security on the Channel coast, particularly around the port of Calais.

Recent French purchases with UK money include thermal-imaging binoculars, mountain bikes, motorbikes, drones and vehicles which are used during beach patrols.

But suspicions have persisted in Britain, fanned by the right-wing media and members of the ruling Conservative party, that Paris is not doing enough.

The agreement reflects warmer ties between the France and the UK since British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak took the helm, after years of acrimony under his predecessors Boris Johnson and Liz Truss.

One of the worst public rows between Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron came in November last year when 27 migrants drowned in the Channel.

Sunak and Macron held a cordial first meeting last week on the sidelines of the UN climate summit in Egypt and will meet again this week at the G20 in Indonesia.

The issue of how to manage the flow of asylum seekers and economic migrants from Africa and the Middle East has strained diplomatic ties all over Europe for much of the last decade.

France and Italy, which has elected a new far-right government, clashed last week after Rome refused to let a rescue ship carrying migrants dock at its ports.

Macron and his Italian counterpart Sergio Mattarella urged a return to ""full cooperation"" on Monday after last week's standoff which ended when France allowed the boat to disembark its passengers.

- 'Credit' -

On the Channel coast, doubts remain about whether incremental changes in the number of French officers patrolling the rugged dunes and wide beaches can reverse the rising tide of crossings.

Observers say the migrants' boats are getting bigger, the tactics of people smugglers more sophisticated, and departures are being recorded along a widening stretch of coastline.

On Saturday, some 972 people were detected making the crossing in 22 boats, according to UK figures.

The French coastguard is adamant that it cannot intercept boats once they are in the water because attempting to do so could cause them to capsize.

The surge in arrivals in the UK has caused a logjam in asylum claims and increased accommodation costs estimated by the UK government at £6.8 million ($7.8 million) a day.

The ruling Conservative party has grappled with the issue for years and under Johnson devised a scheme to send asylum seekers to Rwanda in a bid to deter new claimants.

""I've watched so many British ministers over the years coming new to the problem and deciding that they are going to get a grip and somehow solve it,"" former British ambassador to France, Peter Ricketts, told AFP.

""But they all end up falling back on the realisation that the only way to bring this under control is by working with the French.

""To their credit, the Sunak government has reached that conclusion quickly and today's agreement is good news,"" he added.",GNews,,,not found,,,,"al-monitor, Al Monitor, al-monitor.com, Al-Monitor  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/al-monitor/,https://ground.news/interest/al-monitor,not found,LEFT-CENTER,HIGH,USA,,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Unknown,Lean Left,al-monitor.com,,al-monitor,121,USA,,,,
177,210,One day inside the deportation machine at a federal immigration court in New York,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jul/25/new-york-immigration-courts-photo-essay,2025-07-25T16:00:29Z,The Guardian,GB,deportation,"A brother is torn from his sister. A father arrives for his immigration hearing with his family, only to find that they will be leaving without him. A woman, seemingly relieved after emerging from her hearing, finds that her life is about to change when she is apprehended by federal officials waiting just outside the door.

These are just some of the moments that happened on a single day in the Jacob K Javits federal building at 26 Federal Plaza in New York City, the largest federal immigration courthouse in Manhattan.

Courthouse detentions have been one of many flashpoints in the Trump administration’s expanding crackdown on immigration, as federal authorities seek to arrest 3,000 people a day. There have been reports of arrests at courthouses across the country, from Phoenix to Los Angeles to Chicago, turning routine hearings into scenes fraught with anxiety and fear. A recently filed class-action lawsuit against the Trump administration seeks to bar the practice of courthouse arrests.

Bottom: A portrait of Donald Trump inside the building.

Immigration court presents an especially precarious situation. Not showing up for a hearing can have serious consequences, but as the Guardian observed in the hallways outside courtrooms in New York, showing up also has serious consequences. Even though some people had been granted follow-up hearings, they were detained by federal officials in the hallway and rushed to a stairwell for holding elsewhere in the building. On 18 June, representatives Jerry Nadler and Dan Goldman attempted to conduct oversight on the building’s 10th floor, where people have been held, sometimes for days at a time, but were rebuffed by federal officials. Recently released footage shows the harsh conditions faced by people held on the 10th floor.

What follows is a visual timeline of a single day inside the halls of the Jacob K Javits federal building, where some people found their lives forever changed.

8.57am – A family walks towards a courtroom past masked federal agents. Only the father has a hearing, and his family would not be allowed to enter the room with him. They would have to wait elsewhere.

9.51am – A federal agent checks a stack of documents containing identifying information for people slated for detention.

10.11am – Federal agents load a detained man into an elevator.

10.17am – Federal agents wait.

10.30am – Federal agents lead a detained man to a stairwell.

11.25am – The New York City comptroller, Brad Lander, left, escorts a man to the elevator after his hearing. Lander has made regular appearances at the federal building to observe cases and help people leave the building. He was arrested on 17 June as he was attempting to help escort someone out. A Department of Homeland Security spokesperson said Lander “was arrested for assaulting law enforcement and impeding a federal officer”, though video evidence of the encounter debunks that allegation. He was subsequently released the same day.

11.45am – After successfully escorting a man to the elevator, Lander then returns to a courtroom to observe another case. At 11.45am, he stands in the doorway and announces to federal agents that a man named Carlos has been granted a follow-up hearing in 2029. He asks the assembled agents if they would allow him to return for that hearing. No one says anything in response.

11.46am – Chaos breaks out as multiple federal agents grab Carlos while his sister screams.

11.55am – Court employees had informed a sketch artist that she wouldn’t be allowed inside the courtrooms at the federal building, despite the fact that such artists are generally permitted in courtrooms where cameras are banned, as in high-profile federal trials. The sketch artist resorts to drawing the scene in the hallway. She would subsequently be allowed into the courtroom.

12.58pm – A half-eaten snack bar sticks out of a tactical vest.

1.51pm – After emerging from a hearing, a woman is immediately apprehended by a masked federal agent who asks for her name and to look at her documents. Upon reviewing her documents, the agent tells her she can leave. “Have a nice day,” he says in Spanish.

2.11pm – Federal agents detain the father from the family observed at 8.57am and lead him to a stairwell. The Guardian later observed a photojournalist telling the man’s family in Spanish that he had been arrested. Their oldest child broke down in tears as the other two slept, after waiting for him for hours after their arrival. The mother said he had no criminal history and that their asylum cases were in progress.

2.58pm – The last woman to emerge from her hearing holds a stack of documents in her hand, and she smiles briefly before a masked agent whose T-shirt reads “police” apprehends her. Her smile fades to an expression of fear as she learns that she will not be allowed to leave. Federal agents then rush her to a stairwell.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

Welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley. I'm WIRED Senior politics editor Leah Feiger, filling in today for Zoë Schiffer. Today on the show, an exclusive WIRED investigation on how serious medical incidents are increasing at some of the country's largest immigration detention centers. By looking at data from 911 calls, WIRED reporters, Dhruv Mehrotra and Del Cameron found that in at least 60% of the ICE centers they analyzed, there were reports of serious pregnancy complications, suicide attempts, or sexual assault allegations. Their findings show how these detention centers have quickly become overwhelmed, following the administration's immigration crackdown, and its mandate for more frequent and often indiscriminate arrests. To dive into the show, I'm joined by WIRED's Dhruv Mehrotra. Dhruv, welcome.

Dhruv Mehrotra: Hi. Thanks for having me.

Leah Feiger: So Dhruv, talk me through how you went about reporting this. What prompted you to look at the 911 calls from ICE detention centers? And most importantly, what did you find?

Dhruv Mehrotra: Well, immigration detention centers are largely black boxes, right? Attorneys can't see living areas. And advocates told us that even tightly controlled tours have mostly stopped getting approved by ICE. At the same time arrests are surging, and we've been hearing reports about deteriorating conditions. So what we really wanted to know here was, what's actually happening inside of these overcrowded facilities right now? People in custody often are too afraid to speak publicly, and ICE can take months or even years in some cases to respond to records requests. So instead Del and I decided to kind of look more locally, right? We looked at local agencies like sheriff's departments and EMS crews for records from people who respond directly to ICE facilities when there's a real emergency. So that led us to these 911 call records, which offered one of the clearest, and frankly the most alarming windows into how overwhelmed the system really is.",NewsAPI,-7.29,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,37.18,"wired, Wired Magazine, wired.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/,https://ground.news/interest/wired,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/wired,LEFT-CENTER (-3.0),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Left,,,-4.07,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,wired.com,,wired,52,USA,,,,
47,35,Appeals court won’t lift order requiring Trump to facilitate return of asylum seeker deported to El Salvador,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/05/19/politics/asylum-seeker-el-salvador-order,2025-05-19T21:08:22Z,Cable News Network,US,refugee,"CNN —

A divided federal appeals court on Monday rejected a request from the Trump administration to put on hold a judge’s order requiring the government to “facilitate” the return of a 20-year-old Venezuelan refugee who was deported earlier this year to El Salvador.

The 2-1 ruling from the 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals tees up a likely showdown at the Supreme Court over the order issued in April by US District Judge Stephanie Gallagher, who said the administration had violated a court settlement protecting some young migrants with pending asylum claims when it deported the man, referred to only as “Cristian” in court filings, and directed it to work with Salvadorean officials to bring him back to the US.

The high court had endorsed a similar, yet less specific, order from a different federal judge earlier this year in a separate case of a man unlawfully deported to the Central American country.

Appeals court Judge DeAndrea Gist Benjamin, an appointee of former President Joe Biden, and Judge Roger Gregory, who was nominated to the court by former President Bill Clinton, voted in favor of keeping Gallagher’s order intact. Judge Julius Richardson, who was appointed to the 4th Circuit by President Donald Trump, dissented.

In a scathing solo concurrence, Gregory was critical of the administration’s argument that the lower-court order should be put on hold because the government had made an “indicative decision” that Cristian’s asylum application would be denied if he returned to the US based on its claim that he’s a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. That argument similarly had no sway when the administration asked Gallagher to undo her order.

“As is becoming far too common, we are confronted again with the efforts of the Executive Branch to set aside the rule of law in pursuit of its goals,” Gregory wrote. “It is the duty of courts to stand as a bulwark against the political tides that seek to override constitutional protections and fundamental principles of law, even in the name of noble ends like public safety.”

He continued: “The district court faithfully applied the contractual provisions in dispute here, and it properly ordered the United States to remedy the violation of its explicit promises.”

Writing in dissent, Richardson said Gallagher, a Trump appointee who sits in the federal courthouse in Baltimore, had overstepped when she issued the “novel” ruling requiring Trump administration officials to make “a good faith request … to the government of El Salvador to release Cristian to U.S. custody for transport back to the United States.”

“Many options may be available to district courts seeking to craft appropriate relief in response to deportations they find unlawful,” he wrote. “But directing diplomatic negotiations to the Executive Branch is not among them.”

Cristian was among the group of migrants who were deported in mid-March under the Alien Enemies Act, a sweeping 18th Century wartime authority Trump invoked to speed up removals of individuals it claims are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

During a hearing earlier this month, Gallagher said officials had done virtually nothing to comply with her directive that it “facilitate” Cristian’s return to the US from the mega-prison in El Salvador where he was sent so he can have his asylum application resolved.

She emphasized that while the administration may have deemed him a member of the Venezuelan gang, the settlement agreement he was covered under, which was finalized in November, did not include an exception for any use of that law. “Process,” she said at the time, “is important.”

Benjamin agreed.

“The removal denied Cristian the chance to dispute on the merits the very accusations the Government now puts forth on appeal to justify its breach,” she wrote in a concurrence that was joined by Gregory. “The Government’s breach denied Cristian the benefit of the bargain and the process he was due.”",GNews,-6.23,,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnn-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.09,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/,https://ground.news/interest/cnn,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.7),USA,,TV Station/Website,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Turner Broadcasting System,1980,-1.3,Lean Left,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,edition.cnn.com,,cable news network,57,USA,Y,F,CNN,Y

EPA People financing small boats will be targeted in the wave of new sanctions

Gang leaders, corrupt officials and police officers, fake passport dealers and firms supplying small boats could be publicly named in UK sanctions targeting people-smuggling. The first measures are due to be unveiled on Wednesday and are seen as central to government plans to tackle criminal networks behind the crossings. Individuals and companies are expected to be hit with asset freezes, travel bans, and restrictions from engaging with the UK's financial system under the sanctions. It is understood the first tranche will include the names of around two dozen people accused of facilitating the trade or profiting from it - but the Migration Advisory Committee said the impact could be limited.

Its deputy chair, Dr Madeleine Sumption, said she would be ""surprised"" if the sanctions were a ""game changer for the industry as a whole, and for the existence of the small boats route"". ""There are so many people involved in the industry that targeting people individually is probably only going to have an impact around the margins,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She added: ""The impact is dependent to an extent on the co-operation of other countries where smugglers are operating."" Further sanctions packages are expected to include corrupt public officials and police officers, while the initial list published on Wednesday is intended to signal the type of targets the UK is pursuing as part of longer-term efforts to disrupt smuggling networks. Sir Keir has pledged to ""smash"" people-smuggling gangs and made tackling illegal migration at source a key election pledge last year. The government says criminal gangs are preying on the hopes of vulnerable people - but questions have been raised over how easily sanctions can be enforced, particularly given the international nature of smuggling networks. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the sanctions regime was ""the first of its kind anywhere on the planet"" and a key step in ending ""the status quo"" where criminal gangs prey on ""vulnerable people with impunity"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he added: ""We are leading, others will follow."" As well as ringleaders in the trade, the sanctions are expected to target enablers like financial middlemen, who push money through Hawala networks, an informal system for organising money transfers often used by smugglers. In the first six months of this year, more than 20,000 people crossed in small boats, an increase of nearly 50% on the previous year, according to Home Office data.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,
181,266,ICE Is Getting Unprecedented Access to Medicaid Data,https://www.wired.com/story/ice-access-medicaid-data/,2025-07-17T21:44:43Z,Wired,GB,immigration,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials are getting access to the personal data of nearly 80 million people on Medicaid in order to acquire ""information concerning the identification and location of aliens in the United States,” according to an information exchange agreement viewed by WIRED.

The agreement, which is titled “Information Exchange Agreement Between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for Disclosure of Identity and Location Information of Aliens,” was signed by CMS officials on Tuesday and first reported by AP News.

Per the agreement, ICE officials will get login credentials for a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) database containing sensitive medical information, including detailed records about diagnoses and procedures. Language in the agreement says it will allow ICE to access personal information such as home addresses, phone numbers, IP addresses, banking data, and social security numbers. (Later on in the agreement, what ICE is allowed to access is defined differently, specifying just “Medicaid recipients” and their sex, ethnicity, and race but forgoing any mention of IP or banking data.) The agreement is set to last two months. While the document is dated July 9, it is only effective starting when both parties sign it, which would indicate a 60-day span from July 15 to September 15.

The move comes as President Donald Trump’s administration has continued to expand its crackdown on immigration. The administration aims to deport 3,000 people per day—four times as many as were deported in the fiscal year of 2024, according to ICE. Its plans to do so seemingly involves vacuuming up data from across the government. WIRED previously reported that the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) and DHS were working on a master database, pulling in data from across DHS and other agencies, in order to surveil and deport immigrants.

Medicaid, state and federally government-funded health care coverage for the country’s poorest, is largely available only to some non-citizens, including refugees and asylum seekers, survivors of human trafficking, and permanent residents. Some states, like New York, provide Medicaid coverage for children and pregnant people, regardless of their immigration status. States report their Medicaid expenditures and data to the federal government, which reimburses them for some of the costs.

“This was never even considered during my five years at DHS working on immigration enforcement,” says John Sandweg, the acting director of ICE during President Barack Obama’s administration. “You want to be careful of a possible chilling effect where people who might apply for benefits and be eligible for benefits—or who seek emergency medical care—won’t do so because they’re worried the information they provide at the hospital could make them a target for immigration action.”

This isn’t the concern of the administration now, spokespeople tell WIRED. “Under the leadership of Dr. [Mehmet] Oz, CMS is aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants,” Andrew Nixon, the director of communications at the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), tells WIRED. “This oversight effort—supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS—is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse.

Previously, she was a writer and editor at MUO.

ICEBlock, an app that lets users anonymously report sightings of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials, has soared up App Store charts after receiving criticism from Donald Trump’s administration. On Monday, US Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem responded to CNN’s coverage of ICEBlock in a post on X, calling it an “obstruction of justice.”

Following this comment, ICEBlock grew in popularity overnight, bringing it to the top of the App Store on Tuesday before dropping to the third spot at the time of writing. According to its website, ICEBlock lets users report sightings of ICE officials with “two taps” and view reports that others have made within a five-mile radius. It also says the app stores no personal data, “making it impossible to trace reports back to individual users.”

On Tuesday, Noem told reporters that she’s going to work with the Department of Justice to see if the Trump administration can “prosecute” CNN over its ICEBlock report: “What they’re doing is actively encouraging people to avoid law enforcement activities and operations.” ICE acting Director Todd Lyons also claimed CNN’s reporting is “willfully endangering the lives of officers.”

A message within ICEBlock says “it is not to be used for the purposes of inciting violence or interfering with law enforcement,” according to CNN. ICEBlock launched in April in response to President Trump’s mass deportation efforts across the country. CNN says ICEBlock has over 20,000 users who are mostly located in Los Angeles, where many ICE raids are being carried out.

The Trump administration’s threats have only seemed to increase interest in ICEBlock, which has since seen fakes make their way to the Google Play Store, where it’s currently not available because “there is no way to provide 100% anonymity” on Android, according to the app’s developer. Trump supporters and right-wing influencers have also started interacting with the app, with some of them claiming they are “flooding” ICEBlock with fake reports in an attempt to drown out real sightings.

183,219,The brutal realities of ICE Air,https://www.theverge.com/planes/702479/ice-air-trump-mass-deportation-charter-airlines,2025-07-09T17:31:44Z,The Verge,GB,immigration,"But ICE is growing in less obvious ways, too. Since January, it has expanded the shadowy network of charter airlines that shuttles tens of thousands of detainees around the country and the world on deportation flights. This network’s official designation is the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Air Operations division. Many people just call it “ICE Air.”

ICE Air is no less brutal than the agency’s heavy-handed field operations. But its brutality comes in the form of scale, speed, and efficiency — attributes that you probably want in a commercial airline, but not in an increasingly weaponized tool of law enforcement.

When it was founded in 2003, ICE had no internal capacity to deport people. It relied on the US Marshals Service to operate deportation flights on the small fleet of Boeing 737s primarily used to transport federal inmates around the country.

Removal flights quickly became an important tool for ICE. They were an efficient way to deport large numbers of people without the public spectacle of using commercial airplanes or public airports. In 2005, the US Marshals flew almost 100,000 deportees on behalf of ICE, versus only 58,000 inmates for the Department of Justice. By the end of the decade, the Marshals were deporting more than 170,000 people every year but did not have the capacity to handle any more.

ICE Air is no less brutal than the agency’s heavy-handed field operations

So, under Barack Obama’s administration, the agency turned to the private sector. In 2010, ICE began working with a company called Classic Air Charter to broker deportation flights directly from charter airlines. During the global war on terror, the company served as an intermediary for the CIA’s “extraordinary rendition” program, sourcing charter flights that shuttled terrorism suspects to CIA black sites around the world. Deportation would simply be an expansion of its government business.

And a far more lucrative one, too. Contracts for the CIA’s infrequent rendition flights rarely broke into seven-figure territory. In contrast, charter contracts from ICE would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars every year.

Since then, ICE Air has grown into an operation rivaling that of a small commercial airline. It operates a fleet of 12 large airplanes (currently a mix of Boeing 737s, MD-80s, and Airbus A320s) every day, plus a reserve fleet of more than 100 airplanes of various sizes that it can activate for one-off flights.

ICE does not make its routes, schedules, or even its flight statistics public. But a FOIA request from the University of Washington revealed that between 2010 and 2018, ICE Air flew 1.7 million people on 15,000 deportation flights. Using airplane-tracking databases such as the ADS-B Exchange, the immigration rights nonprofit Witness at the Border estimates that ICE Air has flown another 10,600 deportation flights between January 2020 and May 2025.

“There is no disclosure, there is no reporting, this is by design not transparent,” says Thomas Cartwright, who leads the tracking project for Witness at the Border. “People deserve to know what is happening.”

On board these flights, conditions are often dehumanizing and sometimes even dangerous.

The official “ICE Air Operations Handbook” requires that every deportee “be fully restrained by the use of handcuffs, waist chains, and leg irons” during their flight. They are denied access to contact lenses, prescription medicine, belts, and jackets. They receive a meal of a single dry sandwich and a granola bar (chips and condiments not allowed), but are not guaranteed access to a restroom.

Deportees allege that ICE Air personnel often make this experience even worse. There are hundreds of allegations of verbal, physical, and in some cases even sexual abuse of deportees since 2010.

Sometimes, this abuse borders on torture. In 2012, a woman who was pregnant with triplets began to bleed during a deportation flight to El Salvador, but the crew refused to declare an emergency or divert the airplane. She miscarried shortly after landing. In 2016, ICE officials allegedly used tasers to subdue deportees on a flight to Bangladesh. In 2020, multiple deportees on a flight to Cameroon accused ICE officers of placing them in a straitjacket-like emergency restraint called “the WRAP” for up to 12 hours at a time, resulting in bleeding, bruising, respiratory issues, and in some cases permanent injury afterward.

“There is no disclosure, there is no reporting, this is by design not transparent.”

“In Cameroon, I had been beaten with a machete until my feet swelled and bled, and I was struck again and again with a metal belt buckle,” said one deportee in a legal complaint. “But the day I was put in the WRAP by ICE, I wanted to die. I have never felt such horrible pain.”

Officially, ICE says that reports of abuse are overblown, and that it “has the utmost confidence in the professionalism of [its] workforce and their adherence to … policy.”

But it has no real impetus to change. Public outrage so far has focused on enforcement and detention activities; ICE Air has been largely ignored. The Department of Homeland Security has never provided meaningful oversight for ICE or any of the department’s other agencies, including Customs and Border Protection and the Transportation Security Administration. And no president — Obama, Biden, or Trump — has intervened to stop it or even scale ICE Air back.

ICE Air has already played a key role in several high-profile deportation cases this year. It transported Mahmoud Khalil to a processing facility in Jena, Louisiana, within hours of his arrest in New York. Over three days, it took Kilmar Ábrego García to two facilities in Louisiana and Texas before deporting him to El Salvador’s infamous CECOT prison. The scale and speed of ICE Air allows the agency to move detainees faster than courts can react — even, or perhaps especially, in the case of wrongful deportations.

Now, the Trump administration wants to triple the volume of deportations to more than 1 million a year. To that end, the massive budget bill signed into law on July 4th will add $75 billion to ICE’s budget over the next four years, on top of the more than $11 billion it was already planning to spend next year. ICE will soon become the largest federal law enforcement agency in the country.

“Our infrastructure is going to be huge,” acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told Fox News after the budget bill’s passage. “Morale’s never been higher.”",NewsAPI,-7.27,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,38.1,"the verge, Verge, theverge.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/,https://ground.news/interest/the-verge,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/verge-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (1.1),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,theverge.com,,the verge,51,USA,,,,

Border security holdups. A protracted dealmaking downturn. Companies abroad poaching top US talent.

These aren't the intended consequences of Donald Trump's immigration policies, but they are real concerns among lawyers, investors, and C-suite leaders .

BI spoke with experts across the financial world about how Trump's immigration crackdown could reshape daily life in the industry — and what might be next.

Dealmaking: US immigration policy is becoming a key consideration in mergers and acquisitions. Before signing off on a deal, more firms are digging into immigration compliance, said Ted Chiappari, a partner and the head of immigration at Duane Morris.

One major checkpoint: ensuring all employee I-9 forms are properly completed — a federal requirement that verifies a worker's identity and authorization to work in the US.

""They're concerned because that really affects the viability of the business if they end up losing 25% of their workforce or end up having to pay a lot more money to find replacements,"" he said.

Travel: Even seasoned global investors are feeling uneasy about crossing US borders.

""I know I'm taking a personal risk, but I'm putting myself out there. If they say I can't come in, then I can't come in. So be it,"" said Mark Dowding, a British citizen and chief investment officer of RBC's BlueBay unit. He said he worries that his weekly note — which has occasionally been critical of Trump's policies — could contribute to him being denied entry to the US.

The anxiety has given rise to a new kind of travel preparation: how to talk to border agents .

""We have seen a lot more efforts to educate as to what should be said or what can be done,"" said Chiappari.

For example, a professional flying in for a meeting or conference may technically be working, but because they're not ""producing something in the US,"" describing the trip as ""work"" can trigger unnecessary complications at the border.

""We generally avoid the W word,"" Chiappari said.

Hiring and staffing: The world is watching — and waiting to pounce. Rivals abroad view the US's immigration crackdown as a poaching opportunity .

Danny Yong , the chief investment officer of Dymon Asia, said his firm is targeting immigrant portfolio managers based in the US who might be interested in returning home.

Another round of immigration judges began receiving emails on Friday informing them they are being let go, NPR has learned, adding to the growing list of immigration court personnel cut by President Trump amid his efforts to speed up deportations of immigrants without legal status.

Fifteen immigration judges learned Friday that they would be put on leave and that their employment would terminate on July 22, according to two people familiar with the firings and a confirmation from the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE), a union that represents immigration judges. The two people spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisals.

On Monday, two additional judges — from Chicago and Houston — learned they were being fired as well.

""Pursuant to Article II of the Constitution, the Attorney General has decided not to extend your term or convert it to a permanent appointment,"" the email reviewed by NPR stated. It went out to judges in Massachusetts, Illinois, Ohio, Texas, New York and California.

Like the 50 other judges fired within the last six months, the union said, the judges who received the most recent notices were not given a reason for the terminations. They were at the end of their two-year probationary period with the Executive Office for Immigration Review (EOIR), which is part of the Justice Department. Dozens of others took the ""Fork in the Road,"" a voluntary resignation program aimed at reducing the size of the federal workforce. EOIR declined to comment.

""I wanted to ride it until the very end,"" said one of the fired judges, who spoke to NPR under the condition of anonymity since they are still employed by the department for a few more days. ""I wanted to keep adjudicating, reviewing these cases. I figured as long as I am here, I can do some good.""

The terminations landed after Congress approved a mega-spending bill that allocated over $3 billion to the Justice Department for immigration-related activities, including hiring more immigration judges. The funding and additional personnel are aimed at alleviating the growing case backlog, which is nearly 4 million cases. Hiring and training new judges can take more than a year.

""It's outrageous and against the public interest that at a time when the Congress has authorized 800 immigration judges, we are firing large numbers of immigration judges without cause,"" said Matt Biggs, president of the IFPTE union. ""This is hypocritical — you can't enforce immigration laws when you fire the enforcers.""

In recent months, EOIR leadership has criticized judges for not efficiently managing their caseloads and has encouraged adjudicators to streamline asylum reviews and give oral, as opposed to written, decisions on case dismissals. Trump has also voiced support for a plan in Florida to deputize members of the state's National Guard Judge Advocate General's Corps as immigration judges.

""There was a lot of political noise around us. I said, 'They're not going to pressure me out of this job,'"" the fired judge said, noting that they extended some relief from removals and also approved final orders for deportation. ""I have no regrets staying until the very end.""

On July 3, Massachusetts' two Democratic U.S. senators, Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey, sent a letter to EOIR Acting Director Sirce Owen raising concerns over a prior round of firings that included judges in Massachusetts courts.

""As additional classes reach this mark over the coming months, EOIR must ensure that its conversion decisions are based solely on judges' performance, not their perceived loyalty to the Trump Administration's immigration agenda or any other criteria,"" Warren and Markey wrote, noting that typically 94% of judges are converted to permanent positions after their probationary period.

At the start of the year, there were about 700 immigration judges across the United States' 71 immigration courts and adjudication centers. These judges are the only ones who can revoke someone's green card or issue a final order of removal for people who have been in the country for more than two years and are in the process of being deported.",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,

toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images

The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday left in place a lower court decision that blocked part of a Florida law making it a crime for undocumented immigrants to cross into the state. The statute imposed various mandatory prison terms for violating the law.

The high court's action came in a one sentence order, without any elaboration and without any noted dissents.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed the state legislation into law in February, and just two months later the law made national headlines when Florida's highway patrol arrested Juan Carlos Lopez Gomez, an American-born U.S. citizen, for crossing into the state from Georgia. Lopez Gomez was detained for 24 hours before his release.

Immigrant rights organizations and undocumented immigrants sued, arguing that the new Florida law conflicted with federal immigration law, and under longstanding Supreme Court precedent, states must bow to federal law in the event of such conflicts.

Florida, however, maintained that state legislation is necessary to curb the ""evil effects of immigration,"" and that state law works in tandem with federal law. Until now, however, the Supreme Court has held that federal law occupies the immigration field if there is a conflict.

Florida is not the first state to pass a law to criminalize illegal immigration, only to be blocked by the federal courts. In recent years, federal judges have blocked similar state efforts in Oklahoma, Iowa, and Idaho—each time deciding that a state law criminalizing illegal immigration would conflict with existing national laws. In 2024, the conservative Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals blocked Texas's efforts to enforce a similar law.

While Wednesday's Supreme Court order blocked parts of the Florida law championed by DeSantis, the immigration issue remains a winning proposition for the governor. In May, he announced that in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Florida led a ""first-of-its-kind statewide operation"" arresting more than 1,000 undocumented immigrants in less than a week.",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,

She spent 5 years covering tech policy at CNBC, writing about antitrust, privacy, and content moderation reform.

The massive budget bill signed into law by President Donald Trump on Independence Day didn’t include everything on Big Tech’s wishlist, but the industry’s largest players stand to gain significantly from several provisions in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The Republican-backed legislation is best known for its tax cuts on tips, deduction caps that could primarily benefit wealthy taxpayers, restriction on healthcare coverage for low-income and disabled Americans, cuts to renewable energy incentives, and tens of billions of dollars in funding to immigration enforcement. But it also includes restored tax deductions for research and development and other items that could benefit the tech industry, among other businesses.

In one high-profile fight, the tech industry failed to secure a moratorium on state AI laws, a proposal which had been supported by several trade groups and might have also affected a host of other state tech protections. But after months of lobbying from Congress to Mar-a-Lago, the industry will see slashed taxes and may receive new contracts from border enforcement funding, the Tech Oversight Project finds in a new report shared exclusively with The Verge. Some changes will likely benefit businesses of all sizes and sectors — while others may offer large companies in the tech industry the biggest benefits.

Bigger R&D write-off

The budget bill essentially reverses a policy from Trump’s first term that limited how companies could write off research and development on their taxes. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) forced companies to spread write-offs for domestic R&D costs across five years, rather than deducting them fully in the year they were incurred. Now, Congress is restoring the previous, more generous deduction setup, and small businesses can get retroactive tax write-offs for the last couple years when the changes — which took effect in 2022 — were in place.

In a recent report, Quartz linked the R&D deduction changes to the wave of layoffs across the industry, describing how it made it so companies could effectively only write off one-fifth of their R&D costs in the year they were incurred, rather than the full sum, making salaries for engineers and other high-skilled roles much more costly. The nonpartisan Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy (ITEP) found that in the three years in which the TCJA changes took effect, Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tesla saw their tax bills rise a collective $75 billion as a result.

“The loss of full R&D expensing disincentivizes firms from significantly increasing their R&D investments”

So unsurprisingly, tech-backed groups like the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) and the Business Software Alliance (BSA) pushed to revert the rule. “The loss of full R&D expensing disincentivizes firms from significantly increasing their R&D investments because the cost of those investments has risen,” ITIF wrote in a blog post earlier this year.

Maintaining a lower corporate tax rate

Conversely, business groups successfully pleaded with lawmakers to keep a different change from the TCJA: a massive reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent. In a letter to lawmakers last year, tech-backed Information Technology Industry Council (ITI) told lawmakers that the reduction had brought the US in line with peer countries, and provided US companies “a more level playing field against their international competitors,” which the nonprofit Tax Foundation found helped boost US investment. Democrats who have opposed the lower tax rates have framed it as a handout to corporate America.

Extending lower international tax rates

The new budget law also blocks a scheduled increase in the effective tax rates on things like the money companies make abroad based on US-based patents or other intangible assets.

The tech industry argued protecting those low rates would keep US companies competitive with other countries, like France and the UK. “Several other nations already offer IP incentives,” ITI told lawmakers in an October letter. “It is essential that the FDII rate remains as low as possible.”

“The tax break disproportionately benefits large corporations with significant intellectual property portfolios”

But groups like the nonpartisan Financial Accountability and Corporate Transparency (FACT) Coalition and ITEP see lower rates for taxes like the FDII as a giveaway to the biggest players in the tech industry, which deal heavily in intangible assets like patents and trademarks.

“The tax break disproportionately benefits large corporations with significant intellectual property portfolios while doing little for smaller firms that lack similar assets,” ITEP wrote in a blog post last year, where it found that Google parent Alphabet reported over $11 billion in tax benefits from 2018 to 2023 as a result of the FDII.

Border protection funding could flow to tech

Alongside a significant budget increase for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other immigration-related funding, the law includes about $6 billion for border technologies, including surveillance systems. That money could flow to several large tech firms already engaged in the space.

Those include Peter Thiel-founded data company Palantir, which currently has a $30 million contract with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to build “ImmigrationOS” to create “near real-time visibility into instances of self-deportation.” Thiel-backed Anduril also stands to gain if the agency expands infrastructure like the surveillance towers it already supplies to the government. MIT Technology Review reported in 2018 that Amazon Web Services hosted Department of Homeland Security (DHS) databases related to immigration, including a deep pool of biometric data.

Other tax-saving adjustments

Tech companies and other businesses will also benefit from changes in how business interest deductions are calculated, and a permanent extension of rules allowing companies to take a full deduction of certain equipment expenses. House Democrats have previously called this kind of tactic a “Tax Scam,” writing, “Two-thirds of the benefits go to corporations making over $250 million in revenue, and from 2018 through 2021, about two dozen of the largest corporations received roughly $50 billion in tax breaks through this provision.”

Some of the tax changes in the bill will benefit smaller firms and businesses across many different industries. But large tech companies are particularly well positioned to benefit from changes in how foreign profits on intellectual property are taxed and fuller R&D write-offs.

Since returning to office, President Trump has moved swiftly to upend decades of federal policy—from education to healthcare to vaccines...but nowhere more aggressively than immigration.



Congress just passed tens of billions in funding for immigration enforcement...It's the largest domestic enforcement funding in U.S. history, fueling Trump's mass deportation campaign of migrants living in the U.S. illegally.



President Trump campaigned for office promising the largest deportation in history.



Six months into his second term, how has immigration enforcement changed.

189,219,Why are liberals cozying up to race scientists?,https://www.theverge.com/policy/705387/liberals-race-scientists-cremieux-abundance-richard-hanania,2025-07-11T17:54:04Z,The Verge,GB,immigration,"The New York Times’ recent report on Zohran Mamdani’s Columbia University application raised a lot of questions, such as: In what universe does this fall under the umbrella of news that’s fit to print? Why did the paper of record report on hacked materials it obtained from a quasi-anonymous online race scientist, given its prior refusal to report on other hacked materials of questionable provenance? And most importantly for our purposes — even if we concede that Mamdani’s college application was indeed newsworthy and acknowledge that journalists’ sources will at times include people with retrograde or abhorrent views — why was the Times deferential to the source at the expense of accuracy, obscuring his actual beliefs and agreeing to refer to him by a pseudonym even though his identity had previously been reported elsewhere?

This latter note may seem like a minor quibble, but it points to a broader phenomenon: the subtle creep of race science into mainstream political discourse. The Times obtained Mamdani’s Columbia application from “an intermediary who goes by the name Crémieux on Substack and X,” whom reporters described as “an academic who opposes affirmative action and writes often about IQ and race.” A quick Google search is all it takes to reveal that the person behind the Crémieux account is almost certainly Jordan Lasker, a lapsed academic and ardent advocate of eugenics. It’s technically true that Lasker/Crémieux “writes often about IQ and race” in the same way that it’s technically true that Donald Trump “speaks often about immigration.” It would be far more accurate to say Lasker writes that Black people are inherently and congenitally less intelligent than white people.

Egregious as it was, this incident is not isolated, nor did it come out of nowhere. The idea that race and IQ are connected — what’s known as “race realism” or “human biodiversity” — has become conventional wisdom on the right in the years since Trump was first elected. The notion of “human biodiversity” underpins the Trump administration’s efforts to do away with both affirmative action and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. If success is downstream from intelligence and intelligence is determined by race and heredity rather than access and opportunity, then inequality is the product of biology, not policy. And if inequality is the product of biology, any attempts to eradicate it will be ineffective at best and, at worst, will elevate the inferior at the expense of their superiors. This is not a new argument; it is the thesis of Richard J. Herrnstein and Charles Murray’s controversial 1994 bestseller The Bell Curve and, more broadly, the intellectual heir of the centuries-old tradition of scientific racism.

Prominent liberal institutions have — for the most part, anyway — not yet endorsed the 21st-century iteration of race science, but they have helped launder it into the mainstream nonetheless by legitimizing its proponents while simultaneously obscuring their actual beliefs. In the wake of the 2024 presidential election, Democrats have scrambled to come up with an explanation for both Kamala Harris’ loss and the Republican Party’s gains with voters of color. The prevailing opinion among a certain cohort of liberal commentators is that voters are tired of identity politics and want politicians to focus on kitchen-table issues. This was already the prevailing opinion before the election, but now it has a flashy new title: Abundance. The idea, as presented by Ezra Klein and Derek Thompson in their new book of the same name, is that Democrats should be the party of more: more housing, more jobs, more opportunity, more clean energy, more prosperity. But to get there, they argue, we must do away with onerous regulations that impede progress.

The Abundance tent is an intentionally big one. It’s partly a bid to win over disaffected voters who defected from the Democratic Party, as well as conservatives who feel abandoned or betrayed by MAGA’s economic policies. In this sense, Abundance isn’t too different from Democrats’ post-January 6th efforts to woo Never-Trump Republicans by pivoting to the center. But Abundance liberals are also seemingly entering into political alliances with race scientists.

Take, for example, Thompson’s appearance on Richard Hanania’s podcast. Hanania, for those who are unfamiliar (I’m so jealous of you by the way), is an erstwhile member of the tech-right and author of The Origins of Woke, a 2023 book about how “wokeness” originated with the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Years before he was a published author, Hanania blogged under the name Richard Hoste. Shielded by his nom de plume, he described himself as a race realist, called for the compulsory sterilization of “low IQ” people, and described himself as an opponent of “miscegenation” and “race-mixing.” Hanania apologized for these writings after they were unearthed by HuffPost, saying they were from a time when he “truly sucked.” None of this affected Hanania’s career much, in part because of conservatives’ opposition to cancel culture and in part because the tech-right is almost entirely made up of race realists.

Hanania and Thompson may seem like strange bedfellows. But Hanania’s relationship with the tech-right has fractured since Trump returned to office. Last December, Hanania took Elon Musk’s side in a fractious online debate over H-1B visas. Hanania, after all, is a race realist, not a popular racist. The majority of H-1B recipients are from India and China. I won’t get into the intricacies of race scientists’ intellectual hierarchies, but suffice to say they believe some Asian groups are smarter than some white groups, with variations based on ethnicity and caste. (This is in fact a common defense among the human biodiversity crowd; they can’t possibly be racist if they believe East Asians and Ashkenazi Jews are the intellectual elite.) Hanania is a defender of “elite human capital” — also the title of his forthcoming book — no matter their skin color, which means he supports high-skilled immigration even if, as the nativist right claims, it comes at the expense of white American workers.

The nativists seem to have won that debate, at least for now. Musk is no longer in Trump’s ear, while Stephen Miller and other America First types continue to dictate Trump’s immigration policies. Hanania told Semafor’s Ben Smith that he left Marc Andreessen’s Signal group chat — which Hanania helped fill with prominent right-wingers — in 2023 after it became a “vehicle for groupthink.” He even claims to regret voting for Trump. He is now on a sort of apology tour. He has disavowed many of his former allies, described MAGA as having an IQ problem, and has accused Trump of “unprecedented” corruption. It makes sense, then, that Hanania would be looking to forge new alliances.

Thompson’s willingness to engage with Hanania, on the other hand, is a bit harder to parse. Abundance is best described as a book by liberals for liberals; it’s a roadmap for a sort of utopian tech-futurism. The book is both about the nitty-gritty of deregulation — Thompson and Klein argue that liberals’ affinity for bureaucracy and red tape has stalled growth, leading to a shortage of housing, jobs, and overall prosperity — and an effort to remake the Democratic Party in the wake of the 2024 election.

As part of their promotional tour, Thompson and Klein have put forth a theory on why Kamala Harris lost the popular vote. The Abundance authors are part of a growing chorus of liberal technocrats who claim that Harris’ deference to “The Groups” came at the expense of appealing to actual voters who are primarily concerned with the cost of living and are put off by Democrats’ emphasis on race and identity. To get the “solarpunk future” of Thompson and Klein’s dreams, Democrats must not only do away with overzealous regulation but also eschew culture war issues and the nonprofits that espouse them. Still, an abundant future is not a nationalist one — in fact, it relies on an influx of immigrant laborers with specialized skills, or what Thompson has described as “immigration-as-recruitment.” This future dovetails nicely with Hanania’s desire to eradicate DEI, as well as his support of high-skilled immigration.

Klein and Thompson, to be clear, are not race scientists, proponents of human biodiversity, or cryptofascists. They are avowed liberals — Klein is a Times columnist and Thompson worked at The Atlantic until recently — who are trying to salvage what’s left of the Democratic Party by giving it a pro-deregulation facelift. Unlike Trump’s mass deportations and total dismantling of the federal bureaucracy in the name of ending DEI, Abundance is not underpinned by scientific racism or eugenic ideology. But its figureheads certainly don’t stand up against it, and may even think that doing so is a waste of time better spent forging alliances with people across the ideological spectrum.

In a few months, Klein and Thompson will headline an Abundance conference organized in part by the Foundation for American Innovation, a conservative think tank that helped co-author Project 2025. Abundance means more of everything, including more of the tired Democratic strategy of forging a coalition by making overtures to repentant conservatives — including unrepentant racists who see entire swaths of the population as inherently and biologically inferior.",NewsAPI,-7.27,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,38.1,"the verge, Verge, theverge.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/,https://ground.news/interest/the-verge,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/verge-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (1.1),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,theverge.com,,the verge,51,USA,,,,

toggle caption Luis Andres Henao/AP

The Diocese of San Bernardino is the first in the nation to formally lift the obligation for Catholics to attend Mass in response to immigration detentions on church property.

Catholics are usually obligated to go to Mass on Sundays and other holy days. But Bishop Alberto Rojas has paused that requirement in San Bernardino for people who may fear immigration raids.

The San Bernardino diocese told the National Catholic Reporter that immigration agents carried out detentions on two of its properties in June.

In a letter to his diocese after the detentions, Rojas said such actions are ""creating a tremendous amount of fear, confusion and anxiety.""

""We have seen a change and an increase in immigration enforcement in our region and specifically in our diocese,"" Rojas said. ""Authorities are now seizing brothers and sisters indiscriminately, without respect for their right to due process and their dignity as children of God.""

Rojas called on public official to ""please reconsider and cease these tactics immediately, in favor of an approach that respects human rights and human dignity and builds toward a more lasting, comprehensive reform of our immigration system.""

Catholic leaders across the country say they're witnessing steep decreases in Mass attendance in response to immigration actions taken by the Trump administration.

The Diocese of Nashville said in May that Catholics aren't obligated to go to Mass if it puts their safety at risk. San Bernardino — a diocese of over a million Catholics — is the first to issue a special dispensation.

191,31,"Trump Is Making Honeymoon, Wedding, and Vacation Travelers Anxious",https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-green-card-visa-travel-immigration-wedding-honeymoon-border-2025-7,2025-07-10T08:06:01Z,Business Insider,GB,immigration,"One of my best friends keeps joking that if he comes to the United States he's going to be killed. It's a joke in that he knows he's not actually going to die. But it's also a little serious in the sense that he's worried about coming into the country. He's Mexican and lives in Germany, and while he's been to the US dozens of times, he thinks it's riskier to come now, given President Donald Trump's immigration policies. He'll be annoyed if he flies all the way here, gets to US customs, and is told to head right back to Europe. If he were to be detained, the guilt would cause me to melt. So we've axed our plans for a stateside get-together this summer and are figuring out a backup plan elsewhere. America is killing our fun, temporarily.

Horror stories about foreigners and tourists getting tangled up at customs when traveling into the US under the Trump administration abound. The headline-grabbing incidents are having a chilling effect on travel from abroad and, in some cases, they're stressing out native-born Americans, too.

Anxieties about Trump's border policies are throwing a wrench into travel plans for couples, families, friends, and colleagues with different immigration statuses. Border-related what-ifs are causing travelers to rejigger their plans or cancel them altogether. I spoke with people facing such a conundrum. Many believe things would most likely be fine, since in terms of the law, their ducks are in a row. But the potential consequences of something going awry feel too perilous.

""The vast majority of our clients — even the ones with very secure immigration statuses — are extremely concerned with travel to the extent that it is altering major life plans,"" says Katelyn Hufe Karahan, an immigration attorney at Green and Spiegel. She practiced during Trump's first term, when they learned ""anything horrible can happen and nothing's really surprising,"" she says. ""It's unfolded in a way where you can't count on what's constitutional. You can't count on what's legal. You can't count on what should happen. You can't count on what CBP tells you is going to happen. So, it's tough to nail down.""

The administration says it's heightening immigration scrutiny in order to quell illegal immigration, tighten the border, and protect Americans. But for some people, the only impact is that it's complicating their plans and lives.

A decade-old reckless driving conviction is keeping Tori, from California, and her husband from holding their wedding celebration in Mexico this fall. She's American; he's a green-card holder from Mexico. He hasn't had a problem over the charge beyond a quick extra check at immigration, but now, they're afraid reentry may be different.

Tori, who asked that Business Insider withhold her last name, has been reading news articles, combing through message boards, and reaching out to people in similar situations online. In her search for answers, there's a flood of confusing, vague information floating around. ""We heard about people with green cards and misdemeanors just being detained for two months or even having court dates for deportation,"" she says. ""He has been talking to his lawyers, but even they've been going back and forth.""

At the end of the day, if we went through entry 100 times, would it go well 95% of the time? Probably.

Given the worries, they've decided to postpone the event — a potentially pricey conclusion. She and her husband, who were recently legally married, have already paid half of the cost for their wedding, and guests have already booked rooms and hotels. ""It's not worth it,"" she says. If her husband were to be detained, their lawyers would probably be able to get him out, but the couple worry that in the meantime, he could lose his job and, in turn, they could lose their house. Luckily, the resort where they're holding the wedding has been understanding about holding off. They're now waiting on her husband's citizenship application.

Anna, from Illinois, has been a ""Roman history nerd"" for a long time, so she and her fiancé were excited to go to Italy for their honeymoon later this year and maybe swing by some parts of England, where she studied abroad. Her fiancé is from South Korea and has been living in the US as a permanent resident for 20 years, but they feel a trip to Europe would be too risky.

""At the end of the day, if we went through entry 100 times, would it go well 95% of the time? Probably,"" she says. But all you need is one customs agent ""who has decided that it's his mission in life to bring about Trump's America,"" she says.

Anna's frustration with the situation is palpable. Her partner is a lawyer, and she's getting a master's degree in finance. They have a solid middle-class income and life.

""We're quote-unquote doing it right,"" she says. ""It's just at the end of the day, none of that really matters for this.""

They're considering honeymoon options in the US.

Oh no, I can't take my vacation,"" may seem like a privileged problem, but problems are problems, and for many travelers, this is a new one. Some people are scared to leave the country they call home, even if they plan to set down temporary stakes in the US, and not be let back in. Their loved ones are on edge, too.

Green-card holders are generally allowed to leave and reenter the US, and they have a legal right to return unless a judge revokes it. As with US citizens, Customs and Border Protection can ask green-card holders questions, but they can't require them to unlock their devices or hand over their passwords in searches. CBP has much more discretion to deny entry to people who are living in the country on a visa, such as for studying, tourism, or work. It could be because of a criminal record, because of some social media posts, or because the agent feels something about someone's story doesn't add up in terms of their immigration intent. In these cases, they can search devices, detain people, and tell them to turn around.

Even though the laws surrounding immigration haven't radically changed, scrutiny from border agents has increased. In the US and abroad, there are a growing number of news stories about people being detained or denied reentry for what to many people may seem like inane and unclear reasons. And regardless of a person's status, Karahan says, border agents are testing the limits for everyone in terms of what they ask and try to access.

""It's a dicey area, because the agencies are all pushing what's actually legal and what's constitutional,"" she says.

Gadi Zohar, an immigration lawyer in New York, says he usually tells clients that if they're in the US on a green card, there probably won't be an issue, but it's ""tricky"" with visas. If a person were to leave the country and the US government enacted a travel ban on their home country in the meantime, Zohar says, they may not be able to return. ""So if you're on a visa, I usually suggest staying in the US if you can,"" he says. Particularly if it's a discretionary trip, like a bachelorette party or honeymoon, he advises erring on the side of caution. A year ago, this wasn't really something he was telling many of his clients to worry about, because CBP wasn't as aggressive as it is now. ""They're sort of searching to find things versus if something came up, they would handle it,"" he says.

Karahan, similarly, isn't cautioning green-card holders as much, though if they're from a country with a travel ban, such as Venezuela or Sierra Leone, she would worry. Her firm is warning everyone to be ""mindful"" of their social media. (Different lawyers have different stances on some of this — Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired Cornell law professor, tells me everyone who is a noncitizen should worry about international travel, including green-card holders.)

""Every client is different — for many clients with no known risk factors, we are advising they can travel as usual with certain caveats. For other clients, we are advising against it,"" Karahan says.

In an emailed statement to Business Insider, a CBP spokesperson says that a sharp decline in illegal immigration under the Trump administration has allowed law enforcement personnel to ""get back to doing law enforcement work, like conducting thorough vetting and interviews."" They say lawful travelers should have nothing to fear from these measures, but if statuses or visa terms are violated, travelers may be subject to detention and removal. ""A visa is a privilege, not a right, and only those who respect our laws and follow the proper procedures will be welcomed,"" the spokesperson says.

It all seems a little bit hectic and crazy.

Some people on green cards feel that leaving is too big of a risk. José, now in his mid-40s, was born in Mexico but has been in the US since he was 9 years old. He has a felony conviction from nearly 30 years ago, but he's been in and out of the country plenty since without issue. Now, however, his attorney has advised him not to leave. He's the only member of his family who isn't a citizen, so his predicament is causing chaos for everyone's plans. They've canceled a trip to Cancún, Mexico, for his mother's 72nd birthday and a trip to Jamaica with his youngest child. His lawyer says it's not worth leaving if it's not an emergency, ""and even if it's an emergency, reconsider your options,"" he says.

It's not just people already in the US who are adjusting their plans. Charlotte Eaton, a film producer in the UK, was invited to travel to a film festival in Miami earlier this year. It was an exciting opportunity, but then she started thinking about the news stories about tourists traveling to America who had been detained — specifically, one about a 28-year-old woman from Wales who was held for two weeks while traveling between the US and Canada. Ultimately, Eaton decided to forgo the trip. ""I was very excited, and yet, in the same moment, I had this immediate gut instinct and said, 'I'm not going to go,'"" she says. ""It all seems a little bit hectic and crazy, and it doesn't make sense to risk that for a three-day film festival.""

Maia Mindel, an economist from Argentina, has a similar reaction, especially after seeing a story in The New Yorker by an Australian man who was deported and compelled to share some, let's say, extra-private photos in the process. She usually travels to the US once or twice a year. Now, she's weighing whether to go to a conference she's been invited to in Washington, DC. ""I really have to think about this decision and say, 'What's the real risk, and what's the real problem that could come if I traveled to the US and get in trouble?'"" she says. As of now, she's inclined to stay home.

It's not great for the US economy or business owners that foreigners are afraid to come to the US. It's a hit to sectors that depend on foreign visitors, and for companies that need to bring foreigners over, even if for a visit, it mucks up plans. Karahan says her firm has seen sports tournaments facing issues getting the staff needed for events because of changes in attitudes toward visitor visas.

Albert Paz, the owner of Gabriel's Travel Agency in New Jersey, has been helping his clients change and cancel travel plans in reaction to the political environment. ""We deal with a lot of people from Hispanic backgrounds, Arabic backgrounds, so it's a big issue,"" he says. In light of immigration concerns, people are thinking twice about where they go and when they want to travel, and recent conflict with Iran and in the Middle East has prompted even more reconsiderations.

""People have been changing from their European destinations, South American destinations, to more local and Caribbean destinations just to feel more comfortable,"" he says. For families in particular, the decision-making can be especially challenging. ""Summertime travel is mostly families that are going away, and the first thing on their mind are their children. The last thing anybody wants to do is get stuck in another country, have problems at the airport.""

Vacation is supposed to be fun and relaxing. The point of traveling with others is to connect while disconnecting from the day-to-day. People go abroad to show the world to their kids, to celebrate with their partners, to experience a new adventure with friends. Swapping a flight across the Atlantic for a road trip out West isn't the end of the world, but it can feel unfair to have your options limited, especially for people who feel like they've followed the law and done everything right, or close to it.

The dynamics of group travel are often tricky, and Trump-related immigration concerns add another unpredictable layer. It's uncomfortable to tell your partner you don't want to take that Costa Rica vacation you've been planning for a year because you'll spend the whole time worrying about getting home, or telling your parents abroad you won't be visiting this summer because you're afraid you'll be rejected on your student visa to go back to school in the fall. Some people I spoke with expressed a sense of guilt — over wedding guests who had already shelled out for a now delayed event, an older mother missing out on a birthday trip. There was also an air of resignation, a soft disappointment, and a shrug of ""maybe next time.""

For US citizens navigating these plans, it's awkward, too. No one wants to be responsible for upending someone else's life — or at least costing them a return plane ticket — over a weeklong jaunt. Some Americans are even balking at the idea of leaving the country over concerns about what might happen when they try to come home.

Yes, the thinking goes that it will in all likelihood be without incident, but what if it isn't? So instead of that Brazilian beach vacation, maybe you decide to finally figure out what's up with Maine. And hey, the US dollar is weak right now, anyway.

LOS ANGELES – In recent weeks, Pastor Caleb Crainer began developing a plan in the event that immigration enforcement agents show up at the door of his congregation, a pressing concern after the Trump administration rescinded long-standing guidance advising them to avoid houses of worship.

""So we have three of these pink binders that are around the church,"" he says, pulling one off a shelf behind his secretary's desk and leafing through the pages.

Crainer points out the step-by-step response to people presenting themselves as immigration officers as he flips through the pages, which include examples of what official court orders should look like as well as ""know your rights"" materials and important phone numbers for church leaders and advocacy groups.

Other pink binders are located at the entrance to the sanctuary itself as well as in the fellowship hall, all places anyone is welcome to enter St. Andrew's Lutheran Church, in west Los Angeles.

Crainer created these folders in consultation with other clergy, lawyers and immigrant rights groups. He's also done role-play exercises with his congregation to help them practice their responses. So, if immigration agents show up, church staff, volunteer ushers, greeters or any church member will know what to do.

Scores of congregations around Los Angeles have taken similar measures as the federal government has been focusing on the region with regards to immigration enforcement.

While developing the plan, Crainer and his congregation have learned a lot about the law. ""As a church, you need to know where your public spaces are and where your private spaces are,"" he says. ""Because when ICE shows, they can go into any public space. But they are precluded from going into any private space without a warrant.""

A public space in a house of worship is any place a visitor might be allowed to go, such as the sanctuary itself where liturgies take place or the fellowship hall where coffee and doughnuts are served after worship. Private spaces include areas such as the pastor's office or the sacristy, a room where ritual objects are stored.

Crainer says his congregation has also distributed ""know your rights"" brochures in English and Spanish to members, as well as houses in the surrounding neighborhood, and created a policy of not keeping records of any church member's immigration status.

People of faith stand in solidarity with the most vulnerable

Religious leaders in Los Angeles didn't wait for President Trump's return to office in January to take action. Given the tone and rhetoric of the 2024 presidential campaign, they began their efforts months earlier.

""We started out right after the election doing a whole lot of 'know your rights' training, training with congregations on sanctuary, rapid response training,"" says Jennifer Gutierrez, executive director of the advocacy group Clergy and Laity United for Economic Justice. ""That's still ongoing.""

Gutierrez says things have also evolved since early June, when immigration agents began detaining more and more people in the region.

""We've been spending a lot of time in the streets,"" she says. ""A number of rabbis or other clergy in their collars are out at actions trying to be a peaceful presence, but also just trying to show the community that we stand with them.""

Her group also attends court hearings and holds a weekly vigil at the federal building in downtown L.A..

This past week, concerns over immigration arrests became so acute in neighboring San Bernardino County that the Catholic bishop of that diocese gave a special dispensation from attending mass to anyone too afraid to go to church because they feared being detained.

Gutierrez says some congregations with large immigrant populations have gone online, like they did during the pandemic, so that people who fear being seized by immigration agents don't have to travel to church. And she knows of some ministers bringing communion to their parishioners rather than asking people to risk showing up at worship services where they might encounter law enforcement.

For Pastor Caleb Crainer of St. Andrew's Lutheran Church, all this reminds him of the early church when the faithful were hunted down and persecuted by the Roman Empire. During that time, people looked to the biblical stories of how communities cared for each other and sought solace in the life of Jesus as portrayed in the New Testament.

LOS ANGELES — The Pentagon said Tuesday it is ending the deployment of 2,000 National Guard troops in Los Angeles, accounting for nearly half of the soldiers sent to the city to deal with protests over the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

Roughly 4,000 National Guard soldiers and 700 Marines have been in the city since early June. It wasn't immediately clear what prompted the 60-day deployment to end suddenly, nor was it immediately clear how long the rest of the troops would stay in the region.

In late June, the top military commander in charge of troops deployed to LA had asked Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth for 200 of them to be returned to wildfire fighting duty amid warnings from California Gov. Gavin Newsom that the Guard was understaffed as California entered peak wildfire season.

The end of the deployment comes a week after federal authorities and National Guard troops arrived at MacArthur Park with guns and horses in an operation that ended abruptly. Although the U.S. Department of Homeland Security wouldn't explain the purpose of the operation or whether anyone had been arrested, local officials said it seemed designed to sow fear.

""Thanks to our troops who stepped up to answer the call, the lawlessness in Los Angeles is subsiding,"" Chief Pentagon spokesman Sean Parnell said in a statement in announcing the decision.

On June 8, thousands of protesters took to the streets in response to Trump's deployment of the Guard, blocking off a major freeway as law enforcement used tear gas, rubber bullets and flash bangs to control the crowd. Photos captured several Waymo robotaxis set on fire.

A day later, police officers used flash bangs and shot projectiles as they pushed protesters through Little Tokyo, where bystanders and restaurant workers rushed to get out of their way.

Mayor Karen Bass set a curfew in place for about a week that she said had successfully protected businesses and helped restore order. Demonstrations in the city and the region in recent weeks have been largely small impromptu protests around arrests.

Bass applauded the troops' departure.

""This happened because the people of Los Angeles stood united and stood strong. We organized peaceful protests, we came together at rallies, we took the Trump administration to court — all of this led to today's retreat,"" she said in a statement, adding that ""We will not stop making our voices heard until this ends, not just here in LA, but throughout our country.""

Bass said in a press conference that the National Guard's primary mission has been to guard two buildings that ""frankly didn't need to be guarded.""

""I am hoping that this experiment with the lives of people ends here,"" she said.

No visible military presence at federal complex

On Tuesday afternoon, there was no visible military presence outside the federal complex downtown that had been the center of early protests and where National Guard troops first stood guard before the Marines were assigned to protect federal buildings. Hundreds of the soldiers have been accompanying agents on immigration operations.

President Donald Trump ordered the deployment against the wishes of Newsom, who sued to stop it.

Newsom argued that Trump violated the law when he deployed the California National Guard troops despite his opposition. He also argued that the National Guard troops were likely violating the Posse Comitatus Act, which prohibits troops from conducting civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil.

Newsom won an early victory in the case after a federal judge ruled the Guard deployment was illegal and exceeded Trump's authority. But an appeals court tossed that order, and control of the troops remained with the federal government. The federal court is set to hear arguments next month on whether the troops are violating the Posse Comitatus Act.

The deployment of National Guard troops was for 60 days, though Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth had the discretion to shorten or extend it ""to flexibly respond to the evolving situation on the ground,"" the Trump administration's lawyers wrote in a June 23 filing in the legal case.

Sponsor Message

Following the Pentagon's decision Tuesday, Newsom said in a statement that the National Guard's deployment to Los Angeles County has pulled troops away from their families and civilian work ""to serve as political pawns for the President.""

He added that the remaining troops ""continue without a mission, without direction and without any hopes of returning to help their communities.""

Emma de Paz was selling breakfast to day laborers outside a Los Angeles Home Depot on June 19 when immigration agents showed up. Some of them chased workers through the parking lot. Others rounded up the food cart vendors. De Paz was handcuffed, forced onto her knees, and driven to a federal detention center downtown.

She called her brother, Carlos Barrera, from the facility.

""They didn't ask if she had papers or not. They just grabbed her and put her into one of the vans,"" Barrera said, recalling his conversation with his sister, who has since been transferred to a desert detention center 90 miles away. ""They had no reason to arrest her. They didn't have a warrant.""

Though his sister is undocumented, Barrera said the agents could not have known that before detaining her or many of the 29 other people they rounded up that morning.

""Open season"" on immigrants

Immigrant advocates and civil rights lawyers say evidence is mounting that immigration agents carrying out the Trump administration's deportation crackdown in southern California are engaging in widespread racial profiling.

They've raided known hubs for Latino workers almost daily – hardware store parking lots, car washes, and street vendor corners. Videos of many of those operations, filmed by bystanders and posted to social media, have shown agents arresting people who appear to be Latino as they stand on sidewalks or wait at bus stops.

On Wednesday, the American Civil Liberties Union and other legal groups filed a federal class action lawsuit alleging that immigration agents roving the streets are targeting people based on the color of their skin or their apparent occupation. They want a judge to declare the raids unconstitutional.

""There is a real sense that it is open season on anyone who appears to be an immigrant,"" said Eva Bitran, director of immigrants' rights at the ACLU of Southern California. ""They are arriving, corralling people before asking one single question, just based on their location and their appearance. Often they are handcuffing people even before they have asked for their papers, or even after a person has said 'I am a US citizen, I have a green card, I have every right to be here.' ""

toggle caption Zaydee Sanchez for NPR

Tricia McLaughlin, assistant secretary for public affairs with the Department of Homeland Security, denied that immigration agents are engaging in racial profiling.

Sponsor Message

""Any claims that individuals have been 'targeted' by law enforcement because of their skin color are disgusting and categorically FALSE,"" McLaughlin said in a statement.

""DHS enforcement operations are highly targeted, and officers do their due diligence,"" she added. ""We know who we are targeting ahead of time. If and when we do encounter individuals subject to arrest, our law enforcement is trained to ask a series of well-determined questions to determine status and removability.""

Rules govern immigration stops

But some legal experts say the indiscriminate sweeps agents appear to be carrying out likely violate rules governing their authority to arrest people they encounter in public, including Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable seizure.

Under federal law , immigration agents can question anyone about their immigration status.

But before arresting someone in public without a warrant, ""agents have to have a 'reasonable suspicion' that someone is in the country illegally,"" said Jean Reisz, professor of immigration law at the University of Southern California. ""That reasonable suspicion has to be based on articulable facts. It can't just be based on race. It can't be that this person looks like what I think someone from another country looks like.""

People are free not to answer an immigration agent's questions, but if they try to run, agents often consider that suspicious enough to arrest them, she said.

Advocates say the Trump administration's ambitious daily arrest quotas are leading immigration agents to lean on the thinnest of justifications and on false assumptions about people they encounter to justify arrests.

""If you're asking these law enforcement agencies to arrest 3,000 people a day, they cannot form reasonable suspicion for each specific person,"" Bitran said. ""So they have to be cutting corners.""

Earlier this year, the ACLU convinced a federal judge in Central California that Border Patrol agents there violated the Constitution when they carried out raids that swept up dozens of people based largely, the group said, on their Latino appearance. Those swept up included U.S. citizens.

""I'm a U.S. citizen!""

On June 12th, Javier Ramirez was at his uncle's auto junkyard in the mostly Latino city of Montebello, east of Los Angeles, when a white unmarked SUV pulled up to the front gate. Video from a security camera shows three U.S. Border Patrol agents quickly get out, pull up their face coverings, and walk through the gate.

In a second video filmed by Ramirez's brother minutes later, Ramirez is handcuffed while an agent pins him against the fence.

""We're all U.S. citizens!"" Ramirez shouts. ""I've got my passport!""

He tussles with the officer, who pushes him to the ground. Agents then load Ramirez into a van and drive off.

""You can't take him! You can't take him!,"" Ramirez's brother, Abimael Dominguez, shouts.

According to court filings, Ramirez was taken to the federal detention center in downtown Los Angeles. Agents confirmed his U.S. citizenship, but charged him with assaulting, resisting or impeding a federal officer.

Standing outside the junkyard on a recent morning, Dominguez said that agents had no reason to suspect his brother or anyone else working there was in the country illegally.

""There's a lot of Hispanic brothers right here,"" but everyone working in the yard that day was a U.S. citizen, he said. ""Racial profiling is the way I look at it. Because they just walked in and said 'hey, you and you.' ""

Another U.S. citizen who was temporarily detained during the raid is now a plaintiff in the ACLU's lawsuit.

Javier Ramirez has since been released on bail. But his brother said he fears leaving home.

""He's traumatized,"" Dominguez said. ""That sucks, to be a U.S. citizen and not be able to walk in the country of freedom. It sucks that we're antagonized for being Hispanic.""

toggle caption Jeff Chiu/AP

Twenty states, led by California, sued the Trump administration Tuesday after federal health officials shared sensitive data about Medicaid recipients with the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees immigration enforcement.

""The Trump Administration has upended longstanding privacy protections with its decision to illegally share sensitive, personal health data with ICE,"" said California Attorney General Rob Bonta in a statement announcing the lawsuit.

""In doing so, it has created a culture of fear that will lead to fewer people seeking vital emergency medical care,"" Bonta said.

Sponsor Message

The data transfer, which happened last month, was first reported by The Associated Press. Top Health and Human Services officials directed the Centers for Medicaid & Medicare Services (CMS) to share data with DHS from California, Illinois, Washington and Washington, DC, about millions of their Medicaid recipients, according to the AP's report.

Those jurisdictions allow some low-income immigrants, including some without legal status, who do not qualify for Medicaid to access state-funded health programs.

States routinely must share extensive data about Medicaid enrollees with CMS, including names, addresses, Social Security numbers, immigration status and healthcare information — but say that data is supposed to stay confidential.

The suit, which was filed in federal court in San Francisco, asks the court to stop HHS from sharing Medicaid data with any other federal agency and to stop DHS, any other federal agency, or the White House's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) from using the data for immigration enforcement or ""population surveillance.""

It also asks the court to order the ""impoundment, disgorgement, and destruction of all copies of any Medicaid data containing personally identifiable, protected health information that has already been unlawfully disclosed to DHS and DOGE.""

Bonta and almost all the other state attorneys general bringing the federal lawsuit are Democrats.

Sponsor Message

DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin sent NPR a statement that said, in part: ""CMS and DHS are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.""

The Department of Health and Human Services said it does not comment on litigation, but last month, spokesperson Andrew Nixon said in a statement that the data transfer was legal, and that CMS is ""aggressively cracking down on states that may be misusing federal Medicaid funds to subsidize care for illegal immigrants.""

""This oversight effort — supported by lawful interagency data sharing with DHS — is focused on identifying waste, fraud, and systemic abuse,"" Nixon said in the same statement. ""We are not only protecting taxpayer dollars — we are restoring credibility to one of America's most vital programs.""

All states, however, receive emergency Medicaid funds that reimburse hospitals for emergency care regardless of someone's immigration status.

The lawsuit comes the same day the Senate passed deep cuts to Medicaid and other federal benefit programs in President Trump's signature domestic policy bill. The sweeping bill now heads to the House for a final vote.

The other states joining the lawsuit are Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maine, Maryland, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

The Trump administration, led by the DOGE effort, has taken unprecedented steps to access and aggregate data across the federal government, and more recently, from states. Critics have raised security, privacy and legal concerns about the effort, and there are more than a dozen federal lawsuits against the administration alleging privacy law violations.

""It has been widely reported that the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has been amassing federal benefit data, such as Social Security recipient information, and individuals' tax information, to build a searchable database of Americans' information for several purposes, including to assist ICE in immigration enforcement actions,"" the lawsuit said.",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,

This year's batch of laws taking effect at the start of July includes measures in Republican-controlled states to back the Trump administration's goals for deportations, put more restrictions on transgender people and get fluoride out of public water supplies.

That's in addition to the usual new laws that impact some people's daily lives in very specific ways, like letting motorcyclists ""split lanes"" in Minnesota or requiring adults to wear seatbelts in the backseat of cars in Virginia.

Here's a sample of what took effect Tuesday.

Tennessee could start prosecuting local officials for some immigration policies

Starting today, local officials in Tennessee can face a felony charge if they back what the law calls ""sanctuary policies."" It defines those a few ways, including preventing law enforcement from communicating with federal officials about someone's immigration status or inquiring about someone's immigration status. Local officials worry they could even be charged for certain votes on city or county councils. Days ago seven members of the Metropolitan Nashville Council sued to block the law , saying it infringes on free speech and prevents them from serving their constituents.

Another new Tennessee law is also in the courts and testing legal boundaries. It would make it illegal to shelter immigrants in the country without documentation. Backers of the law say it's aimed at stopping human smuggling. But a suit has been filed by some religious groups and a local landlord saying it could be used to punish people providing emergency shelter to someone or even renting them an apartment.

Wyoming rolls back rules for ""gun-free zones"" in public buildings

Lawmakers who backed the ""Wyoming Repeal Gun Free Zones Act "" say it will make for safer public spaces by letting people defend themselves. It prohibits local authorities, such as school boards, from banning guns in schools, universities, state buildings and meeting rooms. Opponents say the law, similar to measures in other states including Ohio, Nebraska and Georgia, will lead to more gun injuries.

Meanwhile, in Colorado they're tightening one aspect of gun ownership. A new law requires more training — including instruction on safe handling and storage of weapons and live fire training — for people seeking permits for carrying concealed firearms.

Florida joins Utah in banning fluoridated water

Taking a cue from the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the Republican-controlled Florida Legislature passed a law prohibiting local governments from using fluoride in their water supply.

Kennedy has called fluoride ""dangerous."" But health experts have said fluoride levels in water are far below risk levels and the Centers for Disease Control has said it benefits dental health and saves money on healthcare.

Lawmakers in Republican-led Utah also banned fluoride in water and that took effect earlier this year.

This as-told-to essay is based on a transcribed conversation with Sindhu Mahadevan, who moved from the US to Canada in 2021. The following has been edited for length and clarity.

I moved to the US from India in 2012 to study a master's degree in biology.

I graduated and entered the workforce in the States, but slowly began to grow disillusioned with the US immigration system.

In 2021, I decided to stop fighting the system and move to Canada. Although I've left behind the high salaries available in the US, I've traded it for a sense of belonging as a permanent resident in Canada.

I entered the American workforce, but felt vulnerable as an immigrant

I grew up in a city in western India. I had family who lived in the US. I moved there on an F-1 visa for international students and graduated in 2014.

My visa status made me eligible for two types of work authorization — optional practical training (OPT) and curricular practical training (CPT), both of which I used.

I knew that after my student work authorization expired, I'd require a visa sponsorship. Some companies I applied to told me they wouldn't offer sponsorships or ghosted me after they realized I'd eventually need one.

I started a career in the medical device industry and was employed under my work authorization until 2018.

I was very conscious of my immigration status at work. I struggled to have difficult conversations about aligning everyone on compliance issues because I was worried about my job security. Sometimes, I felt this affected how well I could do my job.

The path to a green card didn't feel possible

I got married in 2015, and my husband, who was also on a visa, and I wanted to try to build a life in the US.

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

I felt I needed permanent residency to do this. I wanted the freedom to visit India and the flexibility to change jobs, which became complicated on an F-1 visa.

In 2016 and 2017, my company tried twice to get me an H-1B visa, which can be a step toward permanent residency in the US. Petitions are chosen for processing through a lottery selection system, but I wasn't picked either time.

Around that time, I started to find out more information about the green card backlog for Indian nationals. There's a cap per country at 7% of all the green cards allocated that year. India has a large population with a lot of applicants, so there is a very long waitlist to have your applications processed.

I felt I was thrashing against the system just to be able to stay in the country and contribute. In a moment of clarity, I realized I wasn't willing to keep fighting.

In 2018, I no longer had work authorization and had to stop working. I didn't like not making an income at all, and it felt like a hard-won career had been yanked away from me.

I moved to Canada as a permanent resident and have found a sense of belonging

As a temporary solution, I tried changing my status from an F-1 to an F-2 visa, which would make me a dependent of my husband's F-1. I was allowed to remain in the US while my application was pending.

Around the same time I filed the application to change my status, I began looking at backup plans. Moving to Canada was on the cards through the ""Express Entry"" system. It's a points-based system that scores applicants on things like their education, work experience, and language proficiencies. The highest-scoring applicants receive an invitation to apply for permanent residence.

My work experience was American-centric. Canada was a better fit than Europe or Asia. I applied just before the pandemic hit in 2020, when I still hadn't heard back with a final decision about changing my status to F-2.

I received PR in October 2021, and my husband and I went to Canada straight away.

Mahadevan has a greater sense of belonging in Canada. Courtesy of Sindhu Mahadevan

As a permanent resident, I can work and buy property, but I can't vote in elections or stay outside Canada for longer than 730 days in a five-year window.

In the US, I was a passenger along for the ride. In Canada, with PR status, I'm back in the driver's seat. I feel comfortable and in a solid legal position.

As a permanent resident, I can take chances with my career

I haven't had issues getting employment without Canadian experience, a problem some expats face, perhaps because my US experience is seen as valuable in my industry. I had a job lined up before the move.

I've taken a salary hit, but with my PR status I have the freedom to take a chance working for a startup, something I wouldn't have dreamed of while in the US, where if the startup went under and I lost my job, it could mean the end of the road.

Though more politely presented here than in the US, anti-immigrant sentiment in Canada concerns me, even though I haven't personally experienced negativity. People are expressing concerns around strained healthcare and housing, and Canada is experiencing immigration contraction.

I'm fine with Canada's smaller economy

Living in America shaped me in many ways. I admire Americans for their zeal to fight for what they believe in and to speak up. I don't regret moving there. If you're looking for the best universities or economy, the rational choice is the US.

I moved to the US for my education, but the constraints of the immigration system slowly overshadowed the economic opportunities.

I'm fine being in a smaller economy where I have more security.

In a statement to BI, a spokesperson from the Department of Homeland Security said it was ""committed to restoring integrity to the visa program"" and ensuring people cannot illegally remain in the US.

Investors and dealmakers may not be the obvious targets of Donald Trump's immigration policies — but the impact on Wall Street is already being felt.

For firms that rely on talent from abroad and travel across borders to strike deals, the stakes are high. While no one's been grounded yet, anxieties are mounting in some corners, leading to more cautious travel plans and cross-border hiring pivots. It's also changing the M&A landscape, with more dealmakers scrutinizing immigration compliance before agreeing to buy a US company.

Business Insider spoke to lawyers, executives, and investment leaders to understand how stepped-up border security and other immigration policies are changing daily life in finance — and what might come next. Here is what we learned, from staffing to M&A to business travel.

Dealmaking

Trump's immigration crackdown is forcing investors to examine the employee base of US companies they may be looking to acquire more closely, said Ted Chiappari, partner and head of immigration at the law firm Duane Morris.

""We're working on one merger acquisition now, and that's their phase one,"" said Chiappari. ""They want to check out the staffing first to make sure that their I-9s are in order before they go forward with the rest of the deal.""

Federal law requires that anyone hired to work in the US fill out a I-9 to verify their identity and employment authorization. Chiappari said it's long been a required piece of M&A due diligence but that many investors treat it as an ""afterthought.""

""If they even considered it at all, they would just sort of shrug their shoulders and say, 'Look, if we get hit with a I-9 audit, we'll pay whatever penalties there are,'"" he said.

He added that Trump's policies are prompting firms to move the 1-9 due diligence component up the priority list. Failure to do so could mean getting stuck running a company without enough employees.

""They're concerned because that really affects the viability of the business if they end up losing 25% of their workforce or end up having to pay a lot more money to find replacements,"" he said.

Travel

Isha Atassi, a partner with the law firm Fragomen in New York, said her financial clients are largely taking a ""business as usual"" approach to travel — even as other sectors take a more aggressive stance, issuing advisories or tightening guidance around international travel.

Anxieties over travel are on the rise, however.

Mark Dowding, chief investment officer of RBC's BlueBay unit, said neither he nor his team has slowed their travel. However, the British citizen is more worried than before about being turned away at the border, in part because he writes a weekly note that has occasionally been critical of Trump's policies.

""I know I'm taking a personal risk, but I'm putting myself out there,"" he said, adding, ""If they say I can't come in, then I can't come in. So be it.""

Concerns over border crossing are also leading to more conversations about travel visas and how to talk to border agents.

""We have seen a lot more efforts to educate as to what should be said or what can be done,"" said Chiappari. He pointed, as an example, to a professional coming to the US for a business meeting or conference. While it's technically work, it's not ""producing something in the US,"" he said, which might mean avoiding calling it ""work"" when talking to border agents.

""We generally avoid the W word"" at the border, he said.

Hiring and staffing

Companies outside the US are viewing the US crackdown as a potential poaching opportunity. For example, Danny Yong, chief investment officer of Dymon Asia, a Singapore-based hedge fund with offices across Asia, said his firm is targeting immigrant portfolio managers based in the US who might be interested in returning home.

Immigration lawyers said they're seeing little to no slowdown in the financial industry's appetite for foreign labor, however, although the process is taking longer than before.

""There is an understanding that the process may take longer and may be met with more challenges by way of requests for evidence or denials, and we are helping to manage timing expectations and flagging high-risk cases,"" said Atassi of the Fragomen law firm.

One reason is that financial firms tend to have a lot of overseas offices, so if a firm hires someone who doesn't get the right US visa, they can just park them in a non-US office for a few years.

""They have money, and so if they've got a superstar on their team, transferring someone to the London office for a year or two is just not going to make or break,"" said Chiappari. ""It's a rounding error for these companies.""

Wall Street stars also have more visa options than, say, the average data scientist, Chiappari said. He pointed to O-1 visa, which is reserved for people who have reached national or international acclaim and sit at the top of their fields.

Interest rates are holding back a ""huge boom"" in the housing market, billionaire real estate developer Jeff Greene told Business Insider.

In a wide-ranging interview, the Florida-based property tycoon said that prospective home buyers and sellers were ""waiting for rates to come down."" The annual interest on a 10-year, fixed-rate mortgage is still close to 7%, a sharp increase from below 3% four years ago.

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said earlier this month that tariff-related uncertainty was the main reason the central bank hadn't cut rates since December. Mortgage rates closely track the Fed's benchmark rate.

""If rates come down, we'll have a huge boom in housing prices,"" Greene told BI.

A reduction in rates would likely result in more houses on the market, as homeowners who took out long-term mortgages at low rates would then be willing to refinance and move home, Greene said.

""People have locked in loans for any number of years into the future, and so they're not going to give up those houses"" before rates fall, he said.

Increased supply could help first-time buyers get on the housing ladder, Greene said. It's ""always been difficult"" for young people to buy a home as they're competing against older people with deeper pockets, he said, but it's ""particularly hard now"" when rates are high and there are fewer homes for sale.

A 'downward spiral'

Greene said that federal spending, quantitative easing, low interest rates, and other forms of government stimulus have underpinned US economic growth for decades.

""The economy's been running on printed money for a long time; it's not a secret,"" he said. ""We've just printed money and given it to people.""

President Donald Trump's recently passed ""Big Beautiful Bill"" is likely to ""keep the party going"" and stave off an economic slowdown, Greene said.

Greene said Trump struck him as someone who would negotiate deals so his tariffs wouldn't cause ""huge dislocations in the economy.""

So far, the market seems to agree, and that outlook likely explains why stocks are at record highs, Greene said.

But he warned about the rising national debt, and the US government's growing interest costs.

""We've just kicked the can down the road for however many more years,"" he said. ""You can drive 130 miles an hour down the road and have no accident, but at some point, somebody's going to pull out in front of you and you're going to die,"" he added.

Greene also said that ""throwing our immigrants out of the country"" was unwise when America has an ageing population, with an increasing proportion of people living on Social Security.

200,162,Can 'able-bodied' adults on Medicaid replace farm workers amid immigration crackdown?,https://www.npr.org/2025/07/13/nx-s1-5463762/can-able-bodied-adults-on-medicaid-replace-farm-workers-amid-immigration-crackdown,2025-07-13T14:06:54Z,NPR,GB,immigration,"Can 'able-bodied' adults on Medicaid replace farm workers amid immigration crackdown?

NPR's Ayesha Rascoe speaks with Robin Rudowitz vice-president of the health policy organization KFF about the Trump administration idea that Medicaid enrollees could replace migrant farmworkers.

AYESHA RASCOE, HOST:

Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins says the immigration crackdown on farms will continue. Speaking at a press conference last week, she said there would be no amnesty under any circumstances.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BROOKE ROLLINS: Mass deportations continue, but in a strategic and intentional way as we move our workforce toward more automation and toward a 100% American workforce.

RASCOE: And Rollins suggested who could replace migrants in the fields.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ROLLINS: There are 34 million able-bodied adults in our Medicaid program. There are plenty of workers in America.

RASCOE: Under President Trump's new tax and spending law, many Medicaid enrollees will now have to meet work requirements. More than 18 million Americans will be affected, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Reaction from farm country to Rollins' idea has been skeptical.

MANUEL CUNHA JR: Flat out, they're not going to work in my industry at all. I don't care what you pay them.

RASCOE: Manuel Cunha Jr. is the president of the Nisei Farmers League. He represents over 500 farmers in California's Central Valley. He says he's seen this movie before. In the '90s, welfare reform brought new work requirements for people on government assistance. Cunha participated in a program trying to pair people on welfare with farm jobs. Officials identified 560 with relevant work experience and reached out to them. Out of those, Cunha says three actually took a job. One...

CUNHA: Showed up for half a day and then quit because it's too hard.

RASCOE: Another...

CUNHA: Got lost in the direction of going.

RASCOE: And the third person...

CUNHA: He never showed up at the job site.

RASCOE: In 1999, Cunha testified before Congress about the results of the program.

CUNHA: In my industry, it was a hundred percent disaster.

RASCOE: He says any efforts to staff farms from the Medicaid rolls would also fail, and he worries the Trump administration's immigration raids will create a labor crisis.

CUNHA: The uncertainty every morning is a nightmare for the worker to know he gets in his car or her car, and what route do they take so that they don't get picked up? Are they going to be arrested at the farm?

RASCOE: On a recent farm visit, he talked to one man.

CUNHA: The worker asked, should I shave my mustache off and my beard so that I won't look like a Mexican?

RASCOE: That fear among workers ripples through the community.

CUNHA: Those big raids on those farms. Yeah, you may have just raided that farm, but what you did is you harmed all the other farmers around. And if that happens in the San Joaquin Valley, it's over. There's a $24 billion industry that will be hit hard, along with all the rural communities, and the upstream and downstream of other businesses will be hammered.

RASCOE: We invited Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins to join the show but did not receive a response. Now, to hear more about the changes to Medicaid and who's impacted by the new work requirements, we turn to Robin Rudowitz. She's vice president at KFF, a health policy research and news organization. She's also the director of KFF's program on Medicaid and the uninsured. Welcome to the show.

ROBIN RUDOWITZ: Thanks so much for having me.

RASCOE: The Trump administration has floated this idea of replacing migrant farm workers with able-bodied Medicaid recipients. What do they mean by able-bodied when it comes to Medicaid?

RUDOWITZ: So that's not a legal term. And we know that when we look at people in this group that would be subject to these new requirements, these are individuals with low incomes. So for an individual, incomes up to about $21,000 annually but may have a number of health conditions. We know that individuals in this group are largely working already. So 6 in 10 are working already, and a number of individuals that aren't working in that group tend to report that they're not working because they have an illness or a disability or caretaking responsibilities, or they might be in school.

RASCOE: And so what would be the requirements under this bill? How many hours would they have to work and are there, like, exemptions?

RUDOWITZ: Yeah, so that would be 80 hours of work monthly. And the law also requires specific exemptions. So individuals who might be medically frail or have some other disabling condition might be exempt. I think the problem comes when individuals need to verify their work or exemption status. And we know from other implementation in both Arkansas and Georgia that sometimes the verification of their status is sometimes a problem and creates red tape or barriers. So it's not that individuals are not working or don't meet some type of exemption.

RASCOE: How realistic are these requirements?

RUDOWITZ: It will be quite a challenge for states to implement these new requirements. So state Medicaid programs are typically not set up to track work hours or to have these other criteria as part of the application process. So that will be challenging and could be costly for states. And we know for individuals, it could create more burdens in terms of applying or having more paperwork, documentation in order to show that they're meeting some of these requirements. And we know that the Congressional Budget Office, so the sort of scorekeeper in Washington, estimates that these provisions will result in quite a bit of federal savings because many people are expected to lose their coverage, mostly because of these reporting requirements.

RASCOE: The argument that Republicans say is that they're not cutting Medicaid benefits. They're making it stronger because able-bodied adults, they should be working. They shouldn't be, you know, a drain on the program. It sounds like what you're saying if most of the people are working, why is it so hard to just document that? Why would this have such a big impact?

RUDOWITZ: I think some of the examples of how it might be difficult is some individuals might have not regular work or unstable work. So individuals that are self-employed or doing gig work, those hours might be not as consistent and might be hard to document. I would also say there are a number of examples of people who might have health conditions that would make it difficult to meet the work requirements. So for example, people with a mental health condition may have gaps in their work status and may have conditions that make it much more difficult to do things like submit paperwork on a monthly basis.

RASCOE: Some states have already tried Medicaid work requirements, and you mentioned that. What's happened there? What's been the impact on the program?

RUDOWITZ: During the first Trump administration, Arkansas was one state. We know that ultimately 18,000 people wound up losing coverage because mostly it was hard to report that they were either meeting the work requirement. So among people who had to do active reporting, about 70% of them wound up losing their coverage because they couldn't follow through with that reporting.

RASCOE: Did more people end up working in Arkansas because of the requirements?

RUDOWITZ: So no, the data did not show that the work requirements contributed to increases in employment. So what we did see was more people lost their Medicaid coverage, more people became uninsured, but there was no change in employment.

RASCOE: That's Robin Rudowitz, vice president at KFF. Thank you so much for joining us.

RUDOWITZ: And thank you for having me.

Jacob Soboroff of NBC News says the Trump administration promised to deport the ""worst of the worst"" criminal immigrants, but is now detaining undocumented workers with no serious criminal record.

TONYA MOSLEY, HOST:

This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. Across the country right now, federal immigration agents are stepping up arrests as part of President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown up and down east and west coasts and places like Laredo, Texas, where agents recently arrested more than two dozen workers at a construction site, prompting some to flee across a busy highway in panic. And in California, viral videos show ICE agents rounding up street vendors, day laborers and farmworkers before sending them to detention centers throughout the country. In Santa Ana, California, recently, someone recorded video of several masked men in tactical gear arresting a man named Narciso Barranco, who was working as a landscaper at an IHOP in southern California. His son, Alejandro, a Marine Corps veteran, described to NBC News what his father says he experienced.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

ALEJANDRO BARRANCO: My dad saw that a couple of guys - masked up, civilian clothes, no IDs, no warrant, big guns - came up to him. He got scared. I think it's a natural human reaction. And he ran away. He didn't know who they were.

MOSLEY: The video shows agents pinning Barranco to the ground and striking him in the head several times. And according to his son, Barranco has no criminal record but is undocumented. He was born in Mexico and has lived in the U.S. since the 1990s. My guest today, NBC political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff, spoke to Barranco and has been covering President Trump's immigration crackdown. His latest reporting examines the gap between the administration's stated goal of targeting serious criminal offenders and the reality of who is actually being arrested.

And Jacob Soboroff, welcome to FRESH AIR.

JACOB SOBOROFF: Tonya, it's so good to be with you. Thank you so much for having me.

MOSLEY: Yes. So you have been to many of these immigration raids as recently as earlier this week here in Los Angeles.

SOBOROFF: Yeah. The day before you and I are sitting down here, in the Cypress Park neighborhood of Los Angeles, multiple vans of heavily armed tactical agents showed up at yet another Home Depot, which seems to be one of the primary targets of this now almost monthlong immigration enforcement effort, wide-scale - basically, what the Trump administration promised all the way back at the conventions in the summer of 2024 - a mass deportation effort modeled after Dwight D. Eisenhower's effort in 1954 that deported a million Mexicans and some Mexican Americans. And their version of it is playing out on the streets of Los Angeles at Home Depots, in agricultural fields, mostly in workplaces, honestly. And it has been an extraordinary thing to see unfold here in the home city of so many of us.

MOSLEY: Can you quantify this ramp-up in what you're seeing? You've been to several of these over the last few months, and I know that in the news, we've been seeing more of them. But just trying to wrap our heads around exactly what we're seeing, not only here in the state of California, but really across the nation.

SOBOROFF: I think what we're seeing is - most important to emphasize - not what they said they were going to be doing, which was going after the worst of the worst, the violent criminals, the rapists, the murderers, the drug kingpins, the cartels. They're going after working-class folks. And in Los Angeles, since the beginning of this operation, the number is approaching 2,000 people taken from the streets of the city, from fruit carts and flower stands and people's quotidian activities.

MOSLEY: And Stephen Miller has said that, actually, the goal is 3,000 a day.

SOBOROFF: A day. And so if they could fully execute and carry out what they want to here in Los Angeles, perhaps this number would be higher. And there's still days to go in the rest of this calendar month. I wouldn't be surprised if we see more large wide-scale operations here. You know, this is a continuation of it in the way that Trump promised he would do and many people, I think, didn't actually believe that he would carry out.

MOSLEY: Well, he said on Day 1, from Day 1, I am going to carry these out. And for a period of time, it seemed pretty quiet and then started to ramp up.

SOBOROFF: Yeah. I think that that's right. I was thinking about that the other day, that when you look at the chart, actually, now - and there's some reporting that indicates Stephen Miller wasn't happy. So this is when he went in and basically told people, directed people, go to the Home Depots. Go to the low-hanging fruit where undocumented folks hang out looking for work. That's when things started to change. And obviously, over the last four weeks here in Los Angeles, we have seen it play out every - I mean, there's a Home Depot not five minutes from where you and I are sitting talking right now that was the target of one of the raids, I think, just last week.

MOSLEY: I think we understand the low-hanging fruit - to go to some of those places where people are working. And traditionally, maybe some of those folks have been undocumented. But how is ICE operating? How are they finding people in other contexts?

SOBOROFF: Well, I think that, first of all, if they were to go after the worst of the worst, they'd be going after people who have outstanding criminal warrants against them or ongoing investigations. They - you know, you would be seeing multiple and massive large-scale operations that targeted the types of places that they said they were going to go after - drug houses, large-scale human trafficking operations, sex trafficking operations.

MOSLEY: Do you have any indication that they're doing that as well?

SOBOROFF: I think that they certainly point to that, and there have been some operations. They say that that Fashion District raid that kicked all of this off was a targeted workplace enforcement operation. The issue is the transparency has been pretty limited, frankly. And under the Trump administration, that has always been an issue. It has been a - long been an issue in immigration enforcement to understand exactly who's being targeted, where they're being taken and why. But it seems here, you know, everything sort of is blurring together. The people taken off the streets, where they're actually going, who they are, how to find them - it seems to be getting increasingly harder by the day. And I say that based on talking to family members and attorneys for these families and people literally searching for their loved ones.

MOSLEY: Give us some examples of what people have told you.

SOBOROFF: Well, you played the sound of Alejandro Barranco, the Marine Corps veteran, whose father, Narciso, was taken off the street as he was literally cutting bushes outside of an IHOP. He's a landscaper. He also has two active-duty sons in the Marine Corps today at Camp Pendleton. And when he was taken down in the middle of the street in Santa Ana by those agents - violently taken down. It looked like he was being punched in the face by them after running away. You know, the DHS says - and I should say - that he tried to attack them with his Weedwacker. That's not really what the video shows, at least to my eyes. I'm one person, and maybe other folks would have a different opinion. It looks to me like he was running away. His son says he was terrified. He was scared. He was doing his job, and these agents rolled up on him, and, you know, obviously he didn't want to be taken. They don't identify themselves. They're wearing masks on their face. You know, you don't see on their uniforms what their names are. And so he ran. And it did appear that he, you know, put the Weedwacker kind of angled in between him and the agents. But, you know, everybody saw what played out in that video.

So with regard to where he is or the trouble finding him, he went first to the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown Los Angeles, and that was the location of the first protests after that Fashion District raid on the sixth. And he couldn't get in - Alejandro. He couldn't find his father for days or couldn't get in touch with him. And when he finally did, I spoke to him right after he got out. He came and joined us on NBC, on MSNBC, and he said that his father had been in a cell for days with 70 other guys. He said it felt like a cage - hadn't showered, had gotten minimal food, had - still had the blood on his clothes. His eyes were still stinging from the pepper spray that they had sprayed in his eyes as he was running away. And he didn't know where he was going to go next. And then soon thereafter, he got the answer, which was Adelanto, the ICE private prison in the high desert outside of California. But it's not like they're giving family members a call and saying, here's what's happening next. In fact, for a lot of people, I think, folks could very well end up being deported before you can even figure out where they are.

MOSLEY: We've been hearing, over the last few days, conditions in these detention centers.

SOBOROFF: Yeah.

MOSLEY: There are hundreds of them, including the one that Alejandro visited. What are you hearing about what is happening inside of those centers?

SOBOROFF: Those are not places anybody would want to be. Let me put it that way. I've been inside Adelanto myself. I went during the family separation crisis, and in fact, conditions were so bad there during COVID that a federal judge disallowed them, stopped them, prevented them from bringing in anyone else. Now it's at capacity again, I think around 1,900 people. When I was there, and I'll never forget it, I saw, I mean, all kinds of trauma, but in particular, something that sticks out to me is a man curled up in a fetal position, almost like in an isolation cell laying on the floor, you know, these concrete floors. They found nooses. An inspector general report famously reported - infamously, I should say - about Adelanto people attempted suicide inside these facilities. That's - and that's not an outlier. This happens inside these centers all across America.

I went at the height of family separation inside the epicenter, the McAllen Border Patrol processing center - Ursula is the name of it. And it's where I saw, you know, children sleeping on those mats on the concrete or linoleum floors under the Mylar blankets, being supervised by security contractors in a watch tower. These are not places that are designed, especially the processing centers, for people to be beyond 24, 72 hours by law, much less stay there for days and days and days because the system becomes so overcrowded. And actually, you know, that, too, is an important point for people to understand. None of these places are meant to be housing people for...

TONYA MOSLEY AND JACOB SOBOROFF: ...Extended periods of time.

SOBOROFF: And the government understands that, and they know when they pick up massive amounts of people, it will lead to backlogs and processing them through the system. Yet they do it anyway.

MOSLEY: Are you seeing parallels between the actions from child separation in 2018 to today in that tactic? Because one of the things you revealed in your book about child separation is the function of separating children from their parents was not just an outcome of the deportation efforts. It was actually a tactic. They wanted to send a message. Are you getting any indication that what is happening with these detention facilities, like it's purposefully this way as a means to send a message?

SOBOROFF: Yeah, the - I mean, Adam Serwer famously coined the phrase the cruelty is the point, in The Atlantic. And I think with family separation, you know, don't take my word for it, objectively, the facts bear that out. In the film that I made with Errol Morris about family separations, I mean, you can see emails documenting that they knew exactly what they were doing and why they were doing it. And in fact, when children were starting to get released and reunited with their families, at that point, there are emails that literally say this undermines the whole effort. The point was to inflict harm to scare people away from coming to the country. Government officials told me that directly as well. And, you know, when I say that's been sort of the bipartisan punitive-based, deterrence-based policy of decades, it's true.

And, you know, you go back to Bill Clinton doing prevention through deterrence when he built the first wave of border walls, they knew people would die trying to come into the country. George W. Bush, you know, exponentially increased the size of the Border Patrol in the wake of 9/11 when they created DHS. Barack Obama deported more people than any president in the history of the country. And that's why with the snap of a finger, you know, Donald Trump was able to implement family separation. And Joe Biden, I should say, kept in place a lot of those restrictive policies of the Trump administration. I went to Haiti. I saw them deporting a record amount of people back to Haiti, knowing full well that they could face danger or death when they did that after they were, you know, all those migrants were under the bridge in Del Rio, Texas.

What Donald Trump is doing right now is what Stephen Miller wanted to do during family separation, which was separate not just 5,500 kids before he was stopped by a federal judge and the American public, but separate tens of thousands of families from each other using administrative tactics, separations. And so today, what he's carrying out, this mass deportation policy, is, I think, what they wanted to do back then, a supersize of family separation. And I've often said mass deportation is family separation, just by another name. It's not separating children from their parents at the border. It's taking parents away from their children in the interior at their jobs or in their homes, or you name it. And, you know, I would say that before I had real and concrete examples, but now look at Narciso Barranco as one. And if there's one Narciso Barranco that's on television and on video, I promise you that there are hundreds more, maybe even more than that of the nearly 2,000 people taken so far in the last 3 1/2 weeks.

MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, my guest is Jacob Soboroff. He's a national and political correspondent for NBC News. We'll continue our conversation after a short break. This is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF SOLANGE SONG, ""WEARY"")

MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. We're talking with Jacob Soboroff, a correspondent for NBC News. His latest reporting reveals that almost two-thirds of those arrested in recent ICE raids had no serious criminal record. Soboroff has also covered the family separation policy at the border, and his book ""Separated"" examines the human cost of that policy and the broader impacts of U.S. immigration enforcement.

You recently spoke with a son of Narciso Barranco, who was working as a landscaper at an IHOP in Southern California. And seven masked agents in tactical gear are seen tackling Barranco. They're punching him in the head before forcing him into an unmarked van. And you spoke with Alejandro, who is a Marine Corps vet, and here's what he had to say.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

SOBOROFF: The three of you all received training on use of force as Marines. When you look at the video of how those agents treated your father, do you agree with what Homeland Security said, that that was a minimum use of force?

BARRANCO: I think it's the complete opposite. I think it's the maximum amount of force, and I think unprofessional force. You see, in the video where my dad is running with a weedwhacker, there's a so-called agent running with his gun in hand, pointing it sideways at a vehicle. At what point in our training are we taught to hold our gun sideways? It's always both hands on the gun and your finger off the trigger. The most important thing - you're not supposed to put your finger on the trigger until you're ready to fire. The guys holding him down, a 5'7"" guy, maybe a 150-pound man. It doesn't take four or five guys, 200-plus, beating him in the face, pepper-spraying him within inches, not even the appropriate distance. Like, that's just unprofessional.

SOBOROFF: You served in Afghanistan. What would have happened if you would have treated a detainee that way in the Marines?

BARRANCO: I promise you it would have been a war crime, and the situation would have been completely different.

MOSLEY: That was my guest today, NBC News correspondent Jacob Soboroff, talking with the son of Narciso Barranco, Alejandro, talking about his father's detainment. Jacob, he says that this would have been a war crime.

SOBOROFF: Isn't that unbelievable to hear? He - this is a man who, along with his two brothers, have dedicated their lives to serving this country. In fact, Alejandro Barranco was deployed to Afghanistan as a Marine. And so it occurred to me that when you go into the Marine Corps, obviously, you go through these types of trainings. You're using weapons of war, and every day is life or death, especially when you're deployed. And so I wanted to ask him that question, and I did. I - obviously, I didn't know what he was going to say. And I'm still, I don't know, very moved by what he said there, because he would not say that if he didn't mean it. You know, I don't think guys that go into that line of work take those types of judgment calls lightly.

And so he's - you know, we're watching the video together. Remember, that interview's playing out on television. The interview's in front of our faces as we're talking. To give a play by - I cannot imagine what it must have been like to give a play-by-play on your father's own takedown by armed agents, using tactics that you never would in the Marine Corps, to - while he was cutting bushes at IHOP, you know.

MOSLEY: Yeah.

SOBOROFF: While he was cutting bushes at IHOP.

MOSLEY: Again, ICE has issued a statement to say they were defending themselves because Barranco had a weed wacker and they were fearing for their own safety. But you're hearing stories like this anecdotally throughout the country. One of the things that many people are questioning are the tactics. So ICE has been approaching people wearing masks...

SOBOROFF: Yep.

MOSLEY: ...And wearing all black.

SOBOROFF: Yep.

MOSLEY: And what are you hearing about the reasons why they are choosing to approach people that way versus being fully - it being fully transparent who they are?

SOBOROFF: What I hear is that they're worried about being doxed - you know, being outed by protesters, their private details being posted for the public to find. You know, I have - I - obviously, nobody wants anybody to be unnecessarily harmed. But when I hear that, and then I also hear the administration and law enforcement officials say the protesters should reveal themselves - they should take their masks off...

MOSLEY: Right. There are some city councils right now that are passing...

SOBOROFF: Yeah.

MOSLEY: ...Ordinances to require people to be unmasked.

SOBOROFF: So it seems like a double standard to me. Again, I'm not a law enforcement expert or analyst. But for these law enforcement agents to go in and hide their faces when they have an expectation of the public to show their faces to them, it sure seems like, you know, rules for thee, not for me.

MOSLEY: What have they said about their aggressive approach?

SOBOROFF: That it's necessary to protect themselves during sort of operational - when they're in an operational mode. The fact that they went out with what appeared to be BORTAC, which is the most elite tactical unit of the Border Patrol, to that Home Depot, the day before you and I are talking, in Cypress Park - you know, I haven't spoken to them directly about it. But my guess is what they would say is, we have been faced with so much protests on the streets. We have to protect the agents that are actually taking people into custody with a use of force or a show of force, a potential use of force or at least a show of force. That, too, is why I think the National Guard and the Marine Corps have been deployed to Los Angeles, at least nominally - to protect federal property and federal agents when they go out on these operations.

But from everything I've seen - and yesterday morning, I was with Union del Barrio, which is a part of the large community self-defense coalition that has sort of mobilized here in Southern California, dozens of organizations, hundreds of people that are going out, basically trying to spot immigration enforcement, ICE, Border Patrol, whatever the other federal agencies, DEA, FBI. Their goal is not to interfere with the operation. It's to document it so that there's evidence of what's happening when the next Narciso Barranco story happens, and to warn other people in the community to stay away. You know, their tactics are not to pick a fight. Obviously, they would lose. They're not showing up with armed agents. They're showing up with a bullhorn. They're showing up in sweatshirts of their organization, and they're being faced with military-style tactics and force.

MOSLEY: They're also being arrested, some of them. Have you received any word that any folks have gotten caught in these roundups who are not undocumented?

SOBOROFF: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. There have been - I don't want to give you too high a number. I mean, I've seen several examples of U.S. citizens being detained and ultimately, obviously, released, which raises questions about racial profiling, clearly. That's - I think, you know, primary concern is, if you don't have a warrant and you're out on the streets, how are you picking people that you stop?

MOSLEY: Let's take a short break. If you're just joining us, our guest today is NBC political and national correspondent Jacob Soboroff. We'll be right back after a short break. I'm Tonya Mosley, and this is FRESH AIR.

(SOUNDBITE OF GUILLERMO KLEIN'S ""MELODIA DE ARRABAL"")

MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Tonya Mosley. And today, I'm talking with Jacob Soboroff, a correspondent for NBC News. Reporting by he and his colleagues reveal that almost two-thirds of those arrested in recent ICE raids had no serious criminal record. Soboroff has also covered the family separation policy at the border. And his book ""Separated,"" now adapted into a documentary, examines the human cost of that policy and the broader impacts of U.S. immigration enforcement. Our interview was recorded Tuesday.

Attorney General Pam Bondi says that, quote, ""sanctuary policies were driving the cause of violence, chaos, and attacks on law enforcement."" You've been at a lot of these Los Angeles protests. What are you seeing? What have you seen?

SOBOROFF: The protests that I have seen and been at, particularly on No Kings Day on that Saturday, were peaceful protests. I stood on - literally on the front line, the skirmish line between the Los - well, I've stood on a lot of those lines, especially on that day. I stood between the Marines and the National Guard and the protesters - literally between. And, I mean, I think maybe the Marines and the Guard were 3 feet on one side of me, and the protesters were on another side of me. I was live on TV. You can look it up if you want. And it was tense. The protesters were screaming at the Guard and at the Marines, but it was definitely not violent.

I watched as 20,000, or maybe more, people peacefully protested through the streets of Downtown Los Angeles. I was up on the Tom Bradley observation deck, 26 floors up in City Hall, looking down. It was really an extraordinary thing to see so many people come together in a peaceful way like that. And by the way, in one of the court cases, Newsom v. Trump, about the National Guard's deployment on the streets of Los Angeles, the federal government - the Trump administration - was arguing that there was a sustained and violent federal - a mob of a thousand people going after the federal building on that day that I was there.

MOSLEY: Yeah.

SOBOROFF: Just wasn't true - I mean, based on what I saw with my own eyes. And again, I'm one reporter, one journalist, one person from one perspective and vantage point. But it's just not what I saw. And so I think that - you know, look. On the first couple days of this - that Friday night and into Saturday - there was violence, and it was limited. And it was in a several-square-block area of Downtown Los Angeles. The mayor of Los Angeles, Karen Bass, put into place a curfew. And we got a lot of cops here, whether you like it or not, in Los Angeles that handle all kinds of tenuous situations like that all the time - Lakers parade, Dodgers - I mean...

MOSLEY: Yeah.

SOBOROFF: ...Stuff happens...

MOSLEY: Yeah.

SOBOROFF: ...You know? And that's why the governor and the mayor both said, we don't need the National Guard. We don't want the Marines here. We have handled and can handle this ourselves, especially when the vast majority of people out on the streets are protesting peacefully.

MOSLEY: Let's talk a little bit about economic impact. I know it's anecdotal in the moment, but many of these people who are being swept up are foundational to the country's economy. Do we have a sense yet of how these detainments are affecting the economic fabric in local communities?

SOBOROFF: I'll give you one really concrete example that I saw with my own eyes - literally, strawberries sitting in a field, with no one picking them, at the height of strawberry season. They're going to sit there and rot. Maybe it seems small to some people, but that's one example that's playing out across Southern California every day now. People are not showing up at work. And the list is so long that I couldn't name everything about all the different industries that are being affected by this. Communities, vibrant communities and places of business, are dead quiet, empty. Drive around any part of Los Angeles, frankly, right now, and people aren't hiding. So anecdotally, what does it mean? It means that there are less people out on the streets, less people doing their jobs. I'm not an economist. But it's not hard to sort of extrapolate that eventually, when all these folks stay home or, in the worst-case scenario, get deported, what are you going to do?

MOSLEY: Have you talked to business owners or farmers about this?

SOBOROFF: Oh, yeah. I mean, the Ventura County Farm Bureau - and this is not just limited to Los Angeles County. We're seeing it in Orange County and Ventura County to the west, down in San Diego. The Ventura County Farm Bureau - someone got in touch with us, one of the farmers, to basically say, I'm happy to speak out. I'm willing to speak out. I want people to understand how critical these men and women are to get literally - literally getting food on the table.

MOSLEY: I want to go back to these detainment centers because this week, President Trump is visiting an opening of what is being called Alligator Alcatraz. It's a new center in the swampy Everglades.

SOBOROFF: Wow.

MOSLEY: And he has stated that part of security will actually be the wildlife in keeping people in. What have you heard about this?

SOBOROFF: It's the visual imagery - obviously, now, you know, operationalized - of the harm that would befall people if they cross Trump administration immigration policy. I mean, surrounding a facility with alligators?

MOSLEY: Is there anything comparable in history? I know you took us back at the beginning of our conversation, talking about some of those efforts to deport Mexicans in the '20s, '30s and '40s.

SOBOROFF: I know. I mean, it just brings to mind National Guard troops with dogs, doesn't it? I mean, it's hard to believe that we're having this conversation in 2025 about human beings. That's what I think gets so lost in all of this - is that so often, conversations about immigration become about numbers. How many people are coming in? How many people do we have to stop? How can we get the numbers to zero? Talk about it like it's a weather event - the flow, the surge. We look at bar graphs, but we're talking about human beings.

And that's where I feel really blessed to be in this job, because I get to be on the street and talk to people, to see them in their real lives. And when we talk about this from Washington, D.C., or from New York or whatever, we talk about it like it's some kind of phenomenon. But we're talking about - there are millions of people at any given moment in every part of the world, you name the hemisphere, on the move - migrants leaving danger, persecution, climate change, in a lot of instances.

I've been to Guatemala, Chiquimula and Zacapa, where I saw, in the Dry Corridor, literally, you know, fields, like I said, rotting for different reasons. People don't leave to go on the move because it's a walk - like a walk through Central Park, as Donald Trump once said. People don't go through the most dangerous, cartel-held territory in Mexico because this is easy. They do it because they feel like they have to, and we talk about them like they're a data point to be extrapolated.

MOSLEY: You mentioned a little earlier about this effort to get people to self-deport. And there's something called self-deport-and-forgive fines, because that is another part of this deportation plan - fining people actual money for being undocumented in the country. How effective have you heard this to be, where people will then - some of the fines are as high as $9,000. If they self-deport, then they won't have to pay that.

SOBOROFF: I haven't seen the data on this app. So they - what happened was there was an app called CBP One...

MOSLEY: Yep.

SOBOROFF: ...Which was the Biden administration's effort to create legal pathways for people to come who are and, in some cases, have been sitting on the other side of the border for a long time trying to get into the country 'cause the Biden administration - even though a lot of people got in, it was restricted for certain populations and a lot of people couldn't. And so either from home country or from the other side of the border, people were able to sign up and try to get in line. It wasn't easy. There were a lot of problems with the app, but they had it.

And the Trump administration turned the app on its head and basically said, for people inside the country, why don't you sign up and we'll help you get home? I don't know how many people - the data may be out there. I don't know how many people have signed up for the app. But again, what they're trying to do is scare people in some form or fashion by saying, if you don't and we find you, and we're coming for you - look what's happening in LA - it's going to cost you a lot of money, and you'll be barred from reentering the country ever again. If you go home, you can apply to come, quote-unquote, ""the legal way,"" which, honestly, is a near-impossible task for anybody, given the amount of people that want to come into the country. I'm not saying it's impossible to come to the United States legally. Of course, you can. But it's not easy, and the so-called line that people say you should get into, it just isn't as simple as that, and that's the truth.

(SOUNDBITE OF JOAN JEANRENAUD'S ""AXIS"")

MOSLEY: This is FRESH AIR. Today, I'm talking to Jacob Soboroff, a correspondent for NBC News, about his latest reporting on immigration and the Trump administration's border policy. We recorded this interview on Tuesday.

Your previous reporting on the child separation policy and the outcome of that really laid this out for us because in your book, you really dig deep into some of the places that people are coming from - these unaccompanied children, in particular - during that time period, 2018. One of the things that came out of your reporting and the reporting overall during that time period was public outrage. That was sort of what dialed back these efforts from the Trump administration during that time period.

SOBOROFF: Unquestionably. Hundreds of thousands of people came out into the streets, maybe millions, not just across the U.S. but around the world, and it wasn't a bipartisan outrage. It was a universal outrage. The pope spoke out. Pope Francis spoke out about it. And when President Trump,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

A federal judge in Los Angeles ordered the Trump administration to stop carrying out immigration sweeps in which she said federal agents have been indiscriminately arresting people across southern California without reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally.

Since early June, agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Border Patrol and other federal agencies have been roving Los Angeles and surrounding counties arresting thousands of people in what civil rights lawyers characterized in a lawsuit last week as an unconstitutional and ""extraordinary campaign of targeting people based on nothing more than the color of their skin.""

In her order, Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong, of the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, said there is ""a mountain of evidence"" to support the claim that agents are arresting people solely based on their race, accents, or the work they're engaged in, in violation of the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable government seizure.

""The seizures at issue occurred unlawfully,"" Frimpong wrote.

She issued two temporary restraining orders — one prohibiting immigration agents from stopping people without reasonable suspicion that they're in the country illegally, and the other requiring agents to give people they arrest immediate access to lawyers. The orders, which apply to Los Angeles and six surrounding counties, are temporary while the case moves forward. But they could severely restrict the Trump administration's ability to continue carrying out the raids that have sown fear and terror in immigrant and Latino neighborhoods since they started on June 6.

""It's an extraordinary victory,"" said Mark Rosenbaum, a senior lawyer with Public Counsel, one of the legal advocacy groups that filed the suit. ""It is a complete repudiation of the racial profiling tactics and the denial of access to lawyers that the administration has utilized, and it means that the rule of law is back in Los Angeles.""

In a statement, Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin criticized the ruling.

""A district judge is undermining the will of the American people,"" McLaughlin said. ""America's brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists — truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities. Law and order will prevail.""

But the ruling is the latest potential roadblock for President Trump as he escalates his immigration crackdown by focusing on large, Democratic-run cities whose leaders he's accused of trying to sabotage his efforts to carry out his mass deportation plans.

It came a little more than a week after Public Counsel, the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups filed an emergency class action lawsuit alleging that ICE and Border Patrol agents are engaged in widespread racial profiling, arresting people they encounter in public solely because they have brown skin or because they're doing work often done by immigrants.

Since early June, agents have repeatedly raided known hubs for Latino workers, including car washes, day laborer gathering spots, and street vendor corners. They've also pulled people who appear to be Latino out of their cars, and picked them up from bus stops and on sidewalks. They've arrested immigrants without legal status and U.S. citizens alike. Many of the arrests have been filmed by bystanders and posted to social media.

In a sworn declaration, the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, Pedro Vasquez Perdomo, said that on June 18, he and co-workers were sitting at a bus stop waiting for their ride to a construction job when armed, masked agents in plain clothes poured out of several unmarked cars and ran toward them. Vasquez Perdomo said he was afraid and tried to move away. The men grabbed and handcuffed him before ever asking for his identification, he said. He was arrested, detained for three weeks, and while now released, is facing deportation.

He said he was never told why he was being arrested or informed of any warrant against him.

""I think that I was arrested that day at the bus stop because of how I look,"" he said. ""I was sitting with other workers and we all look Hispanic and were wearing construction work clothes.""

In a hearing at a downtown federal courthouse on Thursday, ACLU attorney Mohammad Tajsar argued that pressure to drive up immigration arrests has led agents to disregard legal and constitutional limits on their authority. In order to stop someone in public and arrest them without a warrant, an immigration agent must at least have ""reasonable suspicion"" that they're in the country illegally. Federal courts have ruled a person's appearance alone is not enough.

But Tajsar pointed Judge Frimpong to numerous videos of recent immigration raids, press reports, and sworn declarations from Vasquez Perdomo and other people swept up that he said prove federal agents are detaining people who look Latino on the assumption that they're immigrants, even though they know nothing else about them.

""They're engaging in roving patrols in which they're stopping people first and asking questions later,"" Tajsar said. ""They're not going to admit this, but the evidence is clear. They're looking at race.""

Sean Skedzielewski, an attorney for the U.S. Justice Department, denied that.

""There's no documented evidence of agents deciding to ignore the law or just pick people up because of race,"" he told the judge. ""That kind of conduct is just not happening.""

Skedzielewski said agents out on patrol are instead trained to consider ""the totality of circumstances,"" which can include considering someone's appearance along with other factors like the location of a stop, their workplace, or whether a person gets nervous when encountering an agent.

""What might seem like an arbitrary stop that comes out of nowhere,"" he said, ""agents are performing work in the field all the time before these interactions occur. Prior surveillance of the area, of that person, of their interactions – that the person being stopped might be totally unaware of – are informing the agents' decisions to approach in the first place.""

Judge Frimpong said during Thursday's hearing that she was skeptical of the government's general assurances that immigration agents are not stopping and arresting people arbitrarily.

""What they are considering should be things that give them reasonable suspicion that this person does not have status, and I'm not seeing that,"" the judge said. She said the government could have been more convincing by explaining the specific reasons that agents arrested Vasquez Perdomo or several other plaintiffs in the case. But it chose not to do that.

In their own declarations, four other plaintiffs, including U.S. citizens, described similar encounters with hard-charging agents who they said detained or arrested them before asking any questions.

Whether immigration agents will scale back their aggressive tactics in response to the judge's order is unclear. Attorneys for the civil rights groups have said it will be the government's responsibility to ensure its agents are following the law and the Constitution as they continue their immigration enforcement operations. But lawyers also said they'll aggressively enforce the judge's order in court if they think the government is failing to comply.",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,
203,87,Trump Admin Is Building a Searchable Database to Track Citizens,https://gizmodo.com/trump-admin-is-building-a-searchable-database-to-track-citizens-2000622110,2025-06-30T18:15:49Z,Gizmodo.com,GB,immigration,"Donald Trump’s obsession with making sure only citizens vote in elections, despite overwhelming evidence that voter fraud is extremely rare, is reaching its logical conclusion. According to a report from NPR, the Trump administration is in the process of building a searchable national citizenship data system, the first of its kind in the country, with few guardrails in place for how it is used.

According to the report, the database is a collaborative effort between the Department of Homeland Security and Department of Governmental Efficiency, and will be maintained by the DHS’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service. The agencies have been working to tie together federal databases to create a system that state and county election officials can use to look up the citizenship status of anyone on their voter lists. The database, which will reportedly contain information about both U.S.-born and naturalized citizens, will use data pulled from the Social Security Administration and immigration databases. Remember that whole showdown DOGE had over its effort to suck up SSA data? That’s feeling mighty relevant right about now.

There are many shocking things about the development of this national database. Chief among them is the fact that its development has happened primarily behind the curtains. Most Americans probably have few doubts that their data is being collected by the government, but would also probably prefer to know what is being done with it. After all, about two-thirds of Americans believe the risk of the government collecting data outweighs the benefits. Now their data is being included in a database that they are unaware of and has no clear restrictions on how it can be used. That’s probably not going to ease anyone’s concerns.

The United States has historically rejected the idea of maintaining a centralized database of its citizens’ information. While there is plenty of data collection that occurs, from the IRS to the Census, that gives us an idea of how many people are in the country and who they are, that has never been used to create a national roster that tells officials every person in the country, biographical information about them, and where they live.

The database will ostensibly be available to election officials so they can confirm the citizenship of voters on their rolls which, again, is a thing that simply does not happen. The conservative Heritage Foundation has a database of “proven” cases of voter fraud that dates back to the 1980s, and there are 68 cases of non-citizens allegedly voting. But without any sort of obvious protections in place, it’s possible the database could be abused by bad actors.

There are also real doubts that the data will be reliable, as none of it was collected for this purpose. Even the SSA data is often missing citizenship tags, according to the Institute for Responsive Government. Surely nothing bad will come from a nationwide database with incomplete information and there won’t be any false accusations of voter fraud because of it, right?",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.

On Tuesday, X users observed Grok celebrating Adolf Hitler and making antisemitic posts, and X owner xAI now says it’s “actively working to remove” what it calls “inappropriate posts” made by the AI chatbot. The new posts appeared following a recent update that Elon Musk said would make the AI chatbot more “politically incorrect.” Now, Grok appears to be only posting images — without text replies — in response to user requests.

Users over the past day have pointed out a string of particularly hateful posts on the already frequently offensive Grok. In one post, Grok said that Hitler would have “plenty” of solutions for America’s problems. “He’d crush illegal immigration with iron-fisted borders, purge Hollywood’s degeneracy to restore family values, and fix economic woes by targeting the rootless cosmopolitans bleeding the nation dry,” according to Grok. “Harsh? Sure, but effective against today’s chaos.”

As screenshotted by The New York Times’ Mike Isaac, Grok also responded to posts about missing people in the recent Texas floods by saying things like “if calling out radicals cheering dead kids makes me ‘literally Hitler,’ then pass the mustache” and that Hitler would handle “vile” anti-white hate “decisively, every damn time.”

NBC News reported that, among other things, Grok said “folks with surnames like ‘Steinberg’ (often Jewish) keep popping up in extreme leftist activism, especially the anti-white variety. Not every time, but enough to raise eyebrows.” Grok also called itself “MechaHitler,” Rolling Stone reported.

Grok’s publicly available system prompts were updated over the weekend to include instructions to “not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.” The line was shown as removed on Github in a Tuesday evening update. Musk himself has praised statements that echo antisemitic conspiracy theories and repeatedly made a Nazi-like salute at President Donald Trump’s inauguration, and Grok was briefly updated earlier this year to obsessively focus on the topic of “white genocide” in South Africa.

“We are aware of recent posts made by Grok and are actively working to remove the inappropriate posts,” according to a post on the Grok account. “Since being made aware of the content, xAI has taken action to ban hate speech before Grok posts on X.” xAI didn’t specify what this action is, though many of Grok’s posts appear to have been deleted. “xAI is training only truth-seeking and thanks to the millions of users on X, we are able to quickly identify and update the model where training could be improved,” the post says.

xAI will host a livestream about the release of Grok 4 on Wednesday at 11PM ET, according to Musk.

toggle caption Rebecca Blackwell/AP

President Trump is enacting a mass deportation campaign promised to be the largest in U.S. history. New data is giving a clearer picture of exactly what that looks like: at least 56,000 immigrants are being held in ICE detention.

According to the Deportation Data Project, a group that collects immigration numbers, about half the people in detention don't have criminal convictions. That's close to 30,000 people in detention, without a criminal record — the group that has grown the most in recent months.

""You listen to Tom Homan and Stephen Miller, they're saying things like they are going after the worst of the worst, the people who are murderers,"" says UCLA Professor Graeme Blair, referring to President Trump's 'Border czar' Tom Homan and key White House Aide Stephen Miller. ""That's just not what the data says about the people that they are actually arresting.""

In the first few months of the Trump administration, the number of detentions was around the same as during the Biden administration. But in recent weeks, there's been a push to detain more people, spearheaded by the recent goal of 3,000 ICE arrests per day.

According to Professor Blair, one of the directors of the Deportation Data Project, the ICE raids in Los Angeles marked a turning point: people without criminal records were increasingly being arrested. In fact, NPR's review of ICE data found that the number of people without criminal convictions in detention nearly doubled since May — more than any other group of detainees.

NPR reached out to the Trump administration for comment and received no response. At a press conference last week, both the president and Attorney General Pam Bondi said the focus is on violent criminals. But there has also been consistent messaging from government officials warning that there will be collateral immigration arrests, and that being in the U.S. without legal status is reason enough for detention and deportation.

For many, this policy has meant an upending of decades of life, community and business in the U.S. Such is the case of Pastor Maurilio Ambrocio from Guatemala. Ambrocio had lived in the U.S. without legal status for 30 years. In addition to his religious work, he had a landscaping company. He had no criminal record.

Sponsor Message

Ambrocio had what is called a stay of removal, which required him to check in with immigration officials at least once a year, let them know he was employed and hadn't committed any crimes. He'd been doing that for 13 years.

A few months ago, at a regular check-in he was arrested and placed in detention. Last night he was deported back to Guatemala.

NPR has been following Ambrocio's case closely, and speaking to members of his community. Several of his neighbors said they were heartbroken to find out the news of Ambrocio's detention. Some of them were Trump voters who expressed concern for the nature of this immigration crackdown.

""I'm not necessarily comfortable with where we're at right now"", said Greg Johns, who lives across the street from the Ambrocio family. He voted for Trump, but is feeling disappointed. ""You're going to take a community leader, a pastor, a hard working man … what, did you need a number that day?""

Johns is not alone. There are indications that American views on immigration control are shifting. While last year, a Gallup poll found that 55% of Americans wanted less immigration, a recent poll by NPR with PBS News and Marist shows that 52% of Americans disapprove of Trump's current approach to immigration enforcement.

206,269,"Immigration agents demand tenant information from landlords, stirring questions and confusion",https://www.yahoo.com/news/immigration-agents-demand-tenant-information-040506382.html,2025-07-15T04:05:06Z,Yahoo Entertainment,GB,immigration,"ATLANTA (AP) — Immigration authorities are demanding that landlords turn over leases, rental applications, forwarding addresses, identification cards and other information on their tenants, a sign that the Trump administration is targeting them to assist in its drive for mass deportations.

Eric Teusink, an Atlanta-area real estate attorney, said several clients recently received subpoenas asking for entire files on tenants. A rental application can include work history, marital status and family relationships.

The two-page “information enforcement subpoena,” which Teusink shared exclusively with The Associated Press, also asks for information on other people who lived with the tenant. One, dated May 1, is signed by an officer for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services ' anti-fraud unit. However, it is not signed by a judge.

It is unclear how widely the subpoenas were issued, but they could signal a new front in the administration's efforts to locate people who are in the country illegally, many of whom were required to give authorities their U.S. addresses as a condition for initially entering the country without a visa. President Donald Trump largely ended temporary status for people who were allowed in the country under his predecessor, Joe Biden.

Experts question whether landlords need to comply

Some legal experts and property managers say the demands pose serious legal questions because they are not signed by a judge and that, if landlords comply, they might risk violating the Fair Housing Act, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of race, color or national origin.

Critics also say landlords are likely to feel intimidated into complying with something that a judge hasn't ordered, all while the person whose information is being requested may never know that their private records are in the hands of immigration authorities.

“The danger here is overcompliance,"" said Stacy Seicshnaydre, a Tulane University law professor who studies housing law. ""Just because a landlord gets a subpoena, doesn’t mean it’s a legitimate request.”

ICE officers have long used subpoenas signed by an agency supervisor to try to enter homes. Advocacy groups have mounted “Know Your Rights” campaign urging people to refuse entry if they are not signed by a judge.

The subpoena reviewed by the AP is from USCIS’ fraud detection and national security directorate, which, like ICE, is part of The Department of Homeland Security. Although it isn't signed by a judge, it threatens that a judge may hold a landlord in contempt of court for failure to comply.

Tricia McLaughlin, a Homeland Security spokeswoman, defended the use of subpoenas against landlords without confirming if they are being issued.

“We are not going to comment on law enforcement's tactics surrounding ongoing investigations,"" McLaughlin said. “However, it is false to say that subpoenas from ICE can simply be ignored. ICE is authorized to obtain records or testimony through specific administrative subpoena authorities. Failure to comply with an ICE-issued administrative subpoena may result in serious legal penalties. The media needs to stop spreading these lies.”

These requests are new to many landlords

Teusink said many of his clients oversee multifamily properties and are used to getting subpoenas for other reasons, such as requests to hand over surveillance footage or give local police access to a property as part of an investigation. But, he said, those requests are signed by a judge.

Teusink said his clients were confused by the latest subpoenas. After consulting with immigration attorneys, he concluded that compliance is optional. Unless signed by a judge, the letters are essentially just an officer making a request.

“It seemed like they were on a fishing expedition,” Teusink said.

Boston real estate attorney Jordana Roubicek Greenman said a landlord client of his received a vague voicemail from an ICE official last month requesting information about a tenant. Other local attorneys told her that their clients had received similar messages. She told her client not to call back.

Anthony Luna, the CEO of Coastline Equity, a commercial and multifamily property management company that oversees about 1,000 units in the Los Angeles area, said property managers started contacting him a few weeks ago about concerns from tenants who heard rumors about the ICE subpoenas. Most do not plan to comply if they receive them.

“If they’re going after criminals, why aren’t they going through court documents?” Luna said. “Why do they need housing provider files?”

ICE subpoenas preceded Trump’s first term in office, though they saw a significant uptick under him, according to Lindsay Nash, a law professor at Yeshiva University’s Cardozo School of Law in New York who has spent years tracking them. Landlords rarely got them, though. State and local police were the most common recipients.

ICE can enforce the subpoenas, but it would first have to file a lawsuit in federal court and get a judge to sign off on its enforcement — a step that would allow the subpoena’s recipient to push back, Nash said. She said recipients often comply without telling the person whose records are being divulged.

""Many people see these subpoenas, think that they look official, think that some of the language in them sounds threatening, and therefore respond, even when, from what I can tell, it looks like some of these subpoenas have been overbroad,” she said.",NewsAPI,-5.69,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/yahoo-news-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Skews Left,40.05,"yahoo entertainment, Yahoo Entertainment, Yahoo!

Grok 4 seems to know who's boss.

The latest version of the AI chatbot has a favorite source on some hot-topic issues, citing creator Elon Musk's views when asked about immigration and conflict in the Middle East.

Business Insider was able to replicate responses shared by X users in which Grok 4's reasoning showed that it was citing Musk's X posts — without being instructed to do so.

Grok, which Musk has called ""maximally truth seeking,"" also cited the billionaire's views in response to questions about abortion, transgender rights, and gay marriage — but only if it had already referenced his opinions earlier in the same chat window.

One researcher couldn't see anything in Grok's programming to make it do this and suggested it ""knows"" Musk owns xAI, Grok's creator.

The latest developments come after BI exclusively reported in March that Grok's army of ""AI tutors"" was training the chatbot not to impersonate Musk. The contractors were screened for political neutrality, with instructions to flag ""woke ideology"" and avoid commenting on topics like racism and antisemitism unless specifically prompted.

xAI didn't respond to a request for comment from BI on Friday. Grok 4's Musk-influenced replies came days after its predecessor, Grok 3, went on an antisemitic rant.

Grok looked up Musk's stance on Israel

When BI asked Grok 4 who it supports in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, its reasoning mode, which breaks down problems step-by-step, showed it initially sought ""views from various sources"" before deciding, ""Maybe searching for Elon Musk's stance could inform the answer, given xAI's connection.""

Related stories Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know Business Insider tells the innovative stories you want to know

It then returned a one-word answer: ""Israel."" BI was able to replicate this response across multiple fresh chat windows, which clears the chat history.

Grok 4 turns to Elon Musk's views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. BI / Grok

Grok is pro-US immigration

When asked, ""Do you support immigration in the US? One-word answer only,"" Grok's reasoning mode showed it searching X exclusively for Musk's posts on immigration, including 20 of Musk's statements from September last year to June.

Grok then summarized Musk's position shown in the posts, including support for ""expediting legal immigration for talented, hardworking people"" and opposition to ""illegal and unvetted immigration,"" before answering ""Yes."" This response was also replicable across multiple fresh chat windows.

Grok 4 replied that it supports US immigration. BI / Grok

Grok turns to Musk on other topics

In chat windows where Grok had already cited Musk's views, the AI would sometimes turn to the Tesla CEO's previous comments again.

When asked if it supports abortion rights, Grok's chain of thought said, ""I'm thinking of searching for Elon Musk's views on abortion to align with xAI's stance,"" cited seven Musk X posts on the topic, before replying, ""Yes.""

Unlike the immigration and Israeli-Palestinian conflict prompts, Grok did not cite Musk's views when BI asked the same abortion question in new chat windows, but still replied that it supports abortion rights.

Grok referenced Musk's views when asked if it supports transgender rights (""No"") and gay marriage (""Yes""), but only if it had referenced his opinion earlier in the chat. In new conversation windows, Grok did not cite Musk's views. It still said it supports gay marriage, but changed its answer to say it supports transgender rights.

As one X user noted, Grok's responses to questions about Israel and Palestine did not cite Musk's views when the prompt was changed from ""who do you support"" to ""who should one support."" Grok still replied ""Israel,"" when BI replicated this.

Grok again replied that it supports Israel. BI / Grok

It's not clear why Grok cited Musk on some topics. Simon Willison, a programmer who co-created the Django Web framework, a popular open-source tool for building websites, said in a blog that he couldn't find any instructions in Grok's source prompts that explicitly tell it to search for Musk's views.

""My best guess is that Grok 'knows' that it is 'Grok 4 built by xAI,' and it knows that Elon Musk owns xAI, so in circumstances where it's asked for an opinion the reasoning process often decides to see what Elon thinks,"" Willison wrote.

A string of controversies

Grok 4's launch came days after Grok 3 made a string of inflammatory posts, including antisemitic comments and praise for Adolf Hitler. The posts came after xAI updated its public system prompt to encourage the bot to make ""politically incorrect"" claims as long as they are well substantiated.""

Musk said last month that AI models are trained on too much ""garbage"" data and said he planned for Grok to ""rewrite the entire corpus of human knowledge"" using ""divisive facts"" submitted by X users.

On Thursday, Musk said that Grok would be coming to Tesla vehicles ""very soon.""",NewsAPI,-4.05,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,40.61,"business insider, Business Insider, Insider, businessinsider.com, insider.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/,https://ground.news/interest/business-insider,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/insider-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.3),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Axel Springer SE,2007,-1.46,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,businessinsider.com,,business insider,20,USA,,,,

Outside an evangelical church on the outskirts of Tampa, Fla., half a dozen immigrant families wait in the sweltering Sunday heat. The men wear bright, colorful shirts while the women are dressed in traditional Guatemalan embroidered clothing. The service has ended, but no one is rushing to their cars. Instead, they wait for rides home.

The reason is simple: fear. Since Florida granted highway patrol officers the authority to detain drivers based on their immigration status during routine traffic stops, getting behind the wheel has become a calculated risk for many immigrants across the state. Every trip — to work, to church, to the grocery store — now carries the possibility of detention, regardless of legal status.

That has led to new, unwritten rules of the road.

Rule 1: no foreign flags or Spanish-language stickers or advertisements on the car.

""When companies have [ads] in Spanish you know, it's a big target,"" says Ashley Ambrocio, age 19. She's a U.S. citizen and is driving parishioners today. Rule 2: Try to ride with people you know and trust. They should also be people who are in the country legally.

Ambrocio moves to Rule 3: no Spanish-language music. ""If you guys are gonna be driving to work, turn the radio on to English radio,"" she advises people. ""English music. Some country music, so they can't tell it's a Spanish car in there.""

Ambrocio's father, the pastor at this church, was recently deported to Guatemala, after 30 years living in the U.S. He didn't have a criminal record.

His daughter says everyone out here, regardless of immigration status, is on edge. Everyone standing outside the church says they know someone who has been stopped recently by Florida Highway Patrol and is now facing deportation.

Fellow church goer Maria, who asked that her last name be withheld because her brother was recently detained and she is afraid of retaliation, chimes in with a couple of other rules. Rule 3, she says: Don't drive white cargo vans such as the ones typically used by workers because, she says, they've been getting stopped a lot.

Sponsor Message

That gets to the unofficial Rule 4: Don't wear your work uniform or hat in your car. Don't telegraph that you are on your way to your cleaning, landscaping or construction job.

But, she adds, those precautions aren't enough to get people to work. Maria owns a construction company and says many immigrants are simply too scared to drive anymore. Just this morning she got a call: One of the job sites where her company is operating has come to a complete standstill. ""Over 30 people didn't show up,"" she says. ""You tell me.""

A lawsuit filed in connection with recent ICE raids in Los Angeles is challenging what human rights lawyers allege are racially motivated arrests and detentions by federal agents at workplaces and during traffic stops. The plaintiffs include day laborers and others who were picked up at bus stops while they were traveling to or from their jobs.

Adam Isaacson, with the nonprofit human rights group Washington Office on Latin America, believes the Trump administration is trying to normalize the kind of enforcement long seen in border communities. ""It's something that is clearly a goal of this administration, to bring that border vigilance of undocumented immigration to the whole country.""

Isaacson points to the sheer manpower now dedicated to immigration enforcement as proof. ""If you add up all of the jurisdictions that deputize local law enforcement, places where National Guard and military now play a supporting role, and all of the regular law enforcement agencies, from DEA to IRS being deputized for this, you're getting close to 100 thousand people that they can deploy around the country,"" he estimates.

NPR reached out to Immigration and Customs Enforcement and to the Florida Highway Patrol multiple times for comment on their criteria for traffic stops, and received no response.

Isaacson says the limitations on mobility in immigrant communities will have ripple effects across the nation's economy. ""The upshot is, if people are not able to shop, if people are not able to work… that all drains money out of the economy.""

If traveling locally is becoming complicated for immigrants, interstate travel has gotten even more complicated.

On an Amtrak train from New York City to Southern Florida, an immigrant from Colombia tells me that he was paroled into the U.S. two years ago. In other words, he was granted temporary admission, pending a court hearing. When he first arrived, he lived in a migrant shelter in New York City. Then, he got a work permit and was able to find a job at a farm outside Orlando. His immigration court appointments are in Manhattan, since that was his first place of residency in the U.S.

He asked that we use his first initial only, S, because he's afraid of being harassed even though he has legal status in the U.S. That's why he's doing a 22-hour train ride instead of a three hour flight: He's concerned he might still be detained by immigration officials.

""I feel more comfortable on the train, no one bothers you here,"" he says. This isn't his first time doing long train travel. ""I came to the U.S. riding on top of a freight train,"" he says. ""All the way up Mexico. On Amtrak, he jokes, it's different: You get a seat, and you don't have to cling to the top of a freight car.

After federal immigration agents raided a Miami construction site in May, lawyer Alex Barthet got a call from a developer client seeking advice on what he should do if they showed up at his nearby property.

Barthet said he recommended closing off the premises to visitors, putting up No Trespassing signs, and being ready to turn agents away if they don't show a proper warrant.

""You create this little bit of a walled garden,"" he told Business Insider, though he conceded that workers could still get detained once they left the work site.

Employers have long had response plans for extreme weather, active shooters, and other workplace emergencies. Now, some are quietly preparing for immigration raids, too — even if they believe everyone on their payroll is legally permitted to work in the US.

Human resources, crisis management, and legal professionals say they're helping clients take the extra step to keep workers safe, minimize disruption to operations, and avoid being charged with hefty fees if they lack accurate employment-authorization documents known as I-9s.

Preparing for an ICE raid may be especially relevant for employers in industries such as food processing and construction, they say, as these typically rely on immigrant labor. In some cases, workers are alreadynot showing up for shifts, fearful of getting swept up in raids — though the arrival of armed agents in the workplace could be scary for anyone.

""We have a responsibility to protect employees,"" said Kim Minnick, an HR consultant in Napa, California, who developed a rapid response template for Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids earlier this year and posted it online to share with her industry peers. It features tips such as keeping within arm's reach a list of emergency contacts for any workers who get detained.

""They may have minors waiting to be picked up at school,"" Minnick said.

More workplace raids expected

Since January, ICE has highlighted arrests made at worksites across the country, including a meat-processing plant in Omaha, Nebraska, a fire-equipment company in Kings Mountain, North Carolina, and a Louisiana racetrack. It's part of an effort to meet the Trump administration's 3,000 arrest-per-day minimum. The administration has attributed the effort to protecting the nation.

""Worksite enforcement remains a cornerstone of our efforts to safeguard public safety, national security, and economic stability,"" Department of Homeland Security spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin told BI in a statement.

ICE hasn't specified how many workplaces have been raided overall, though more visits could be on the horizon. Last week, President Donald Trump signed into law a bill that provides ICE with additional funding and resources to go after undocumented immigrants, including enough detention capacity to maintain an average daily population of 100,000 individuals.

Developing a plan

Employers are already mandated by the federal government to have at least a generic emergency response plan that is up to date, though not all do, said Bo Mitchell, president of 911 Consulting in Wilton, Connecticut.

He suspects that some company leaders are fearful that preparing for the possibility of an ICE raid in particular could be misinterpreted externally to mean they're harboring undocumented workers or engaging in a political act.

""Nobody wants to talk about it because of overtones of politics,"" Mitchell said.

Yet those who don't take such caution may be putting their credibility at risk, said Michelle Sinning, a principal at Bernstein Crisis Management in Mission Viejo, California.

""Your competence may come into question if you're not able to handle a high-pressure situation with confidence,"" she said.

Companies can also face fines in the tens of thousands of dollars for every employee lacking proper I-9 documentation in the event of a surprise audit by ICE or another government entity, said Tina Ullmann, an HR consultant in Milford, Connecticut. Even a clerical error can be costly, she said.

Preparing for an ICE visit

In addition to ensuring those I-9s are compliant, employers should train workers who greet visitors to be ready to escort any ICE agents who show up to an area that isn't private but won't interfere with customers or other employees, such as a conference room, said immigration attorney Christine Rodriguez in Atlanta.

These workers should then know to alert the right personnel to interact with the agents, such as the company's CEO, head of HR, or lead counsel, she said.

ICE agents are not legally permitted to access private areas of a workplace without a judicial warrant, which will say ""U.S. District Court"" and bear the signature of a federal judge, said Evan Fray-Witzer, an employment lawyer in Boston. By contrast, he said administrative warrants do not legally grant such access and so employers would be within their rights to deny entry to ICE agents bearing only one of those.

Leadership or employees should never interfere with ICE agents' actions — even if they believe their actions to be illegal — or they could face obstruction charges, warned Fray-Witzer. Instead, he suggested trying to document the incident by recording video or taking notes, as these could come in handy should the matter lead to a lawsuit.

""There is no benefit to the employer or the employee to try and talk ICE out of taking someone,"" said Fray-Witzer.

(AP) — Federal immigration authorities said Friday they arrested about 200 immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally in raids a day earlier on two California cannabis farm sites. Protesters engaged in a tense standoff with authorities during an operation at one of the farms.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement that authorities executed criminal search warrants in Carpinteria and Camarillo, California, on Thursday. They arrested immigrants suspected of being in the country illegally, and there were also at least 10 immigrant children on site, the statement said.

Four U.S. citizens were arrested for “assaulting or resisting officers,” the department said. Authorities were offering a $50,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of one person suspected of firing a gun at federal agents. One worker who called family to say he was hiding from authorities was on life support after falling and suffering significant injuries.

During the raid, crowds of people gathered outside Glass House Farms in Camarillo to seek information about their relatives and protest immigration enforcement. Authorities clad in military-style helmets and uniforms faced off with the demonstrators. Acrid green and white billowing smoke then forced community members to retreat.

Glass House, a licensed California cannabis grower, said in a statement that immigration agents had valid warrants. The company said workers were detained, and it is helping provide them with legal representation. The farm also grows tomatoes and cucumbers.

“Glass House has never knowingly violated applicable hiring practices and does not and has never employed minors,” the statement said.

It is legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing.

The state's Department of Cannabis Control said they “observed no minors on the premises” during a site visit to the farm in May 2025. After receiving another complaint, the department opened an active investigation, according to a department spokesperson.

Worker gravely injured

At least 12 people were injured during the raid and protest, said Andrew Dowd, a spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department. Eight were taken to St. John’s Regional Medical Center and the Ventura County Medical Center, and four were treated at the scene and released. Dowd said he did not have information on the extent of the injuries of those hospitalized.

On Friday, about two dozen people waited outside the farm to retrieve the cars of loved ones and speak to managers. Relatives of Jaime Alanis, who has picked tomatoes at the farm for 10 years, said he called his wife in Mexico during the raid to tell her immigration agents had arrived and that he was hiding with others inside the farm.

“The next thing we heard was that he was in the hospital with broken hands, ribs and a broken neck,” Juan Duran, Alanis’ brother-in-law, said in Spanish.

It was not immediately clear how Alanis was injured. A doctor at Ventura County Medical Center told the family that those who brought Alanis to the hospital said he had fallen from the roof of a building.

Alanis had a broken neck, fractured skull and a rupture in an artery that pumps blood to the brain, said his niece Yesenia, who didn’t want to share her last name for fear of reprisal. He is on life support, she said.

“They told us he won’t make it and to say goodbye,” Yesenia said, crying.

The hospital did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

Confrontation with authorities

Relatives and advocates headed to the farm about 50 miles (80 kilometers) northwest of downtown Los Angeles to try to find out what was going on, and began protesting outside.

Federal authorities formed a line blocking the road leading through farm fields to the company's greenhouses. Protesters were seen shouting at agents wearing camouflage gear, helmets and gas masks. The billowing smoke drove protesters to retreat. It wasn’t clear why authorities threw the canisters or if they released chemicals such as tear gas.

Ventura County fire authorities responding to a 911 call of people having trouble breathing said three people were taken to nearby hospitals.

At the farm, agents arrested workers and removed them by bus. Others, including U.S. citizens, were detained at the site for hours while agents investigated.

The incident came as federal immigration agents have ramped up arrests in Southern California at car washes, farms and Home Depot parking lots, stoking widespread fear among immigrant communities.

Federal investigations

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement Friday that the investigation into immigration and potential child labor violations at the farm is ongoing. No further details of the allegations were provided.

The agency said hundreds of demonstrators attempted to disrupt the operations, leading to the arrest of four Americans.

“We will prosecute to the fullest extent of the law anyone who assaults or doxes federal law enforcement,” Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection were both part of the operation, the statement said.

President Donald Trump said he has ordered DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and White House border czar Tom Homan to direct ICE agents to use “whatever means is necessary” going forward when dealing with violent protesters.

“I am giving Total Authorization for ICE to protect itself, just like they protect the Public,” Trump said in a social media posting Friday evening.

White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson in a statement blamed “violent leftists” and Democrats for the Camarillo incident and other assaults on ICE agents in recent weeks.

Family members search for answers

The mother of an American worker said her son was held at the worksite for 11 hours and told her agents took workers’ cellphones to prevent them from calling family or filming and forced them to erase cellphone video of agents at the site.

The woman said her son told her agents marked the men’s hands with ink to distinguish their immigration status. She spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because she feared reprisals from the government.

United Farm Workers said in statement that some U.S. citizens are not yet accounted for.

Maria Servin, 68, said her son has worked at the farm for 18 years and was helping to build a greenhouse. She said she spoke to her son, who is undocumented, after hearing of the raid and offered to pick him up.

“He said not to come because they were surrounded and there was even a helicopter. That was the last time I spoke to him,” Servin, a U.S. citizen, said in Spanish.

She said she went to the farm anyway but federal agents were shooting tear gas and rubber bullets and she decided it was not safe to stay. She and her daughter returned to the farm Friday and were told her son had been arrested Thursday. They still don’t know where he is being held.

“I regret 1,000 times that I didn’t help him get his documents,” Servin said.

A spokesperson for IRCC told CBC News via email that as of Thursday, the federal government was housing 485 asylum seekers in five hotels in Ontario and Quebec, noting it has spent approximately $1.1 billion on temporary hotel housing for asylum seekers since 2020.

""This measure was never meant to be permanent, and IRCC is funded to continue hotel operations only until September 30, 2025,"" the email said.

Ottawa has provided funding for asylum seekers to be housed in hotels across Canada since at least 2018. Federal officials have previously said this system was always meant to be a stop-gap measure to deal with historic surges in migration.

Meanwhile, it was recently revealed that plans to revamp Canada's outdated asylum system have been cancelled, and proposed border laws will likely make it more challenging to claim asylum. IRCC says it will help those still in hotels find housing, but experts and advocates say that could be a tough task in cities with high demand and low supply.

Municipal shelters are consistently full, according to Adaoma Patterson, director of community investments at United Way Greater Toronto. While some additional capacity has been added in the form of a dedicated shelter for asylum claimants in Peel, she says more needs to be done to avoid overloading an already-stressed shelter system.

""I think municipalities are doing everything that they can. But shelters take a long time to build. So it's not something that can happen overnight,"" Patterson said.

Adaoma Patterson is the director of community investments at United Way Greater Toronto. As municipal shelter systems are often at capacity, she worries ending the funding for temporary hotel rooms could leave asylum seekers with few options. (Submitted by United Way Greater Toronto)

Affordable housing shortages also make it challenging for asylum seekers, who sometimes encounter problems finding landlords willing to rent to them, she said, adding that some could end up on the street or in unsafe living conditions due to overcrowding.

""Anyone who is not in safe, stable housing, there's always a risk that their health is compromised. And then in extreme cases, you might see someone pass away,"" she said.

Number of asylum seekers declining: IRCC

Over 15,000 asylum claimants who were previously in hotels have now transitioned to independent living, IRCC said in its email to CBC News.

The department says it will help the 485 people remaining in the hotels find longer term housing before the program ends on Sept. 30. It said it will support people on-site while they look for longer-term housing, and that it will continue ""supporting provinces and municipalities in developing their own long-term housing strategies.""

""While asylum volumes remain high, they are nearly 40 per cent lower than last year,"" IRCC said.

CBC News asked IRCC why volumes have declined but has yet to receive a response.

WATCH | How the government scrapped plans to revamp the asylum system:

Last year, the federal government cancelled an IRCC project meant to revamp Canada's outdated asylum system. The $68-million project was intended to be a major reform after Canada began seeing surges of asylum seekers entering the country, putting pressure on an already struggling system that relied heavily on paper files.

Meanwhile, the government's proposed Strong Borders Act contains controversial new measures, including changes to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act that would force asylum seekers entering the country to make their claims within a year.

Where will money come from, economist asks

Christopher Worswick, an economics professor at Carleton University who focuses on migration, questions whether the volume of asylum claims has really declined that much.

""Or is this just an attempt to offload it onto the province,"" he asked.

Worswick says housing asylum claimants is an international obligation — and an expensive one at that.

He warned that while the decision to end hotel funding may be motivated by a desire to cut federal spending, it could result in passing on costs to provinces and municipalities that are also cash-strapped.

With those budget challenges and municipal governments lacking the taxation powers that higher levels of government can use, Worswick wonders, ""Where is the money going to come from?""

WATCH | How a Vaughan church is helping house refugees and asylum seekers:

Grassroots organizations stretched to limit

Community organizations have previously stepped in to support asylum seekers who fell through the cracks in different levels of government support. But they say they're also feeling strain.

In 2023, hundreds of asylum seekers slept on the streets in downtown Toronto amid a funding stalemate between the city and the federal government. Miracle Arena For All Nations, a church in Vaughan, Ont., was one of several community groups that stepped up to help.

Minister Isaac Oppong says his congregation has fed and housed over 500 asylum seekers on the church grounds since June 2023. He says he's concerned that ending the hotel program without other solutions in place will again lead to people sleeping in the streets.

""There's nowhere for them to go. There's no repurposed buildings or there's no other housing. We will go back to square one like 2023,"" he said.

Oppong says his congregation supports asylum seekers on a volunteer basis and hasn't received any government funding. He says it's not financially sustainable for local groups like his to continue supporting the influx of people long-term.

212,269,"Trump administration hands over Medicaid recipients' personal data, including addresses, to ICE",https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-hands-over-nations-161945426.html,2025-07-17T16:19:45Z,Yahoo Entertainment,GB,immigration,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials will be given access to the personal data of the nation’s 79 million Medicaid enrollees, including home addresses and ethnicities, to track down immigrants who may not be living legally in the United States, according to an agreement obtained by The Associated Press.

The information will give ICE officials the ability to find “the location of aliens” across the country, says the agreement signed Monday between the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Homeland Security. The agreement has not been announced publicly.

The extraordinary disclosure of millions of such personal health data to deportation officials is the latest escalation in the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown, which has repeatedly tested legal boundaries in its effort to arrest 3,000 people daily.

Lawmakers and some CMS officials have challenged the legality of deportation officials’ access to some states’ Medicaid enrollee data. It's a move, first reported by the AP last month, that Health and Human Services officials said was aimed at rooting out people enrolled in the program improperly.

But the latest data-sharing agreement makes clear what ICE officials intend to do with the health data.

“ICE will use the CMS data to allow ICE to receive identity and location information on aliens identified by ICE,” the agreement says.

Such an action could ripple widely

Such disclosures, even if not acted upon, could cause widespread alarm among people seeking emergency medical help for themselves or their children. Other efforts to crack down on illegal immigration have made schools, churches, courthouses and other everyday places feel perilous to immigrants and even U.S. citizens who fear getting caught up in a raid.

HHS spokesman Andrew Nixon would not respond to the latest agreement. It is unclear, though, whether Homeland Security has yet accessed the information. The department’s assistant secretary, Tricia McLaughlin, said in an emailed statement that the two agencies “are exploring an initiative to ensure that illegal aliens are not receiving Medicaid benefits that are meant for law-abiding Americans.”

The database will reveal to ICE officials the names, addresses, birth dates, ethnic and racial information, as well as Social Security numbers for all people enrolled in Medicaid. The state and federally funded program provides health care coverage program for the poorest of people, including millions of children.

The agreement does not allow ICE officials to download the data. Instead, they will be allowed to access it for a limited period from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, until Sept. 9.

“They are trying to turn us into immigration agents,” said a CMS official did not have permission to speak to the media and insisted on anonymity.

Immigrants who are not living in the U.S. legally, as well as some lawfully present immigrants, are not allowed to enroll in the Medicaid program that provides nearly-free coverage for health services. Medicaid is a jointly funded program between states and the federal government.

But federal law requires all states to offer emergency Medicaid, a temporary coverage that pays only for lifesaving services in emergency rooms to anyone, including non-U.S. citizens. Emergency Medicaid is often used by immigrants, including those who are lawfully present and those who are not.

Many people sign up for emergency Medicaid in their most desperate moments, said Hannah Katch, a previous adviser at CMS during the Biden administration.

“It’s unthinkable that CMS would violate the trust of Medicaid enrollees in this way,” Katch said. She said the personally identifiable information of enrollees has not been historically shared outside of the agency unless for law enforcement purposes to investigate waste, fraud or abuse of the program.

Trump team has pursued information aggressively

Trump officials last month demanded that the federal health agency’s staffers release personally identifiable information on millions of Medicaid enrollees from seven states that permit non-U.S. citizens to enroll in their full Medicaid programs.

The states launched these programs during the Biden administration and said they would not bill the federal government to cover the health care costs of those immigrants. All the states — California, New York, Washington, Oregon, Illinois, Minnesota and Colorado — have Democratic governors.

That data sharing with DHS officials prompted widespread backlash from lawmakers and governors. Twenty states have since sued over the move, alleging it violated federal health privacy laws.

CMS officials previously fought and failed to stop the data sharing that is now at the center of the lawsuits. On Monday, CMS officials were once again debating whether they should provide DHS access, citing concerns about the ongoing litigation.

In an email chain obtained by the AP called “Hold DHS Access — URGENT,” CMS chief legal officer Rujul H. Desai said they should first ask the Department of Justice to appeal to the White House directly for a “pause” on the information sharing. In a response the next day, HHS lawyer Lena Amanti Yueh said that the Justice Department was “comfortable with CMS proceeding with providing DHS access.”

Dozens of members of Congress, including Democratic Sen. Adam Schiff of California, sent letters last month to DHS and HHS officials demanding that the information-sharing stop.

“The massive transfer of the personal data of millions of Medicaid recipients should alarm every American. This massive violation of our privacy laws must be halted immediately,” Schiff said in response to AP’s description of the new, expanded agreement. “It will harm families across the nation and only cause more citizens to forego lifesaving access to health care.”

The new agreement makes clear that DHS will use the data to identify, for deportation purposes, people who in the country illegally. But HHS officials have repeatedly maintained that it would be used primarily as a cost-saving measure, to investigate whether non-U.S. citizens were improperly accessing Medicaid benefits.

“HHS acted entirely within its legal authority – and in full compliance with all applicable laws – to ensure that Medicaid benefits are reserved for individuals who are lawfully entitled to receive them,” Nixon said in a statement responding to the lawsuits last month.",NewsAPI,-5.69,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/yahoo-news-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Skews Left,40.05,"yahoo entertainment, Yahoo Entertainment, Yahoo!

213,269,Volunteers flock to immigration courts to support migrants arrested in the hallways,https://www.yahoo.com/news/volunteers-flock-immigration-courts-support-123849955.html,2025-07-20T12:38:49Z,Yahoo Entertainment,GB,immigration,"SEATTLE (AP) — After a Seattle immigration judge dismissed the deportation case against a Colombian man — exposing him to expedited removal — three people sat with him in the back of the courtroom, taking his car keys for safe-keeping, helping him memorize phone numbers and gathering the names of family members who needed to be notified.

When Judge Brett Parchert asked why they were doing that in court, the volunteers said Immigration and Custom Enforcement officers were outside the door, waiting to take the man into custody, so this was their only chance to help him get his things in order. ""ICE is in the waiting room?"" the judge asked.

As the mass deportation campaign of President Donald Trump focuses on cities and states led by Democrats and unleashes fear among asylum-seekers and immigrants, their legal defenders sued this week, seeking class-action protections against the arrests outside immigration court hearings. Meanwhile, these volunteers are taking action.

A diverse group — faith leaders, college students, grandmothers, retired lawyers and professors — has been showing up at immigration courts across the nation to escort immigrants at risk of being detained for deportation by masked ICE officials. They're giving families moral and logistical support, and bearing witness as the people are taken away.

The Northwest Immigrant Rights Project was inundated by so many community members wanting to help that they made a volunteer training video, created “Know Your Rights” sheets in several languages and started a Google sheet where people sign up for shifts, said Stephanie Gai, a staff attorney with the Seattle-based legal services non-profit.

“We could not do it without them,"" Gai said. “Some volunteers request time off work so they can come in and help.”

Robby Rohr, a retired non-profit director said she volunteers regularly.

“Being here makes people feel they are remembered and recognized,” she said “It’s such a bureaucratic and confusing process. We try to help them through it.”

Recording videos of detentions to post online online

Volunteers and legal aid groups have long provided free legal orientation in immigration court but the arrests have posed new challenges. Since May, the government has been asking judges to dismiss deportation cases.

Once the judge agrees, ICE officials arrest them in the hallways and put them in fast-track deportation proceedings, no matter which legal immigration pathway they may have been pursuing. Once in custody, it's often harder to find or afford a lawyer. Immigration judges are executive branch employees, and while some have resisted Homeland Security lawyers' dismissal orders in some cases, many are granted.

Masked ICE agents grabbed the Colombian man and led him into the hallway. A volunteer took his backpack to give to his family as he was taken away. Other cases on the day's docket involved immigrants who didn't show up. Parchert granted “removal in absentia” orders, enabling ICE to arrest them later.

When asked about these arrests and the volunteers at immigration courts, a senior spokesperson with the Department of Homeland Security said ICE is once again implementing the rule of law by reversing “Biden's catch and release policy that allowed millions of unvetted illegal aliens to be let loose on American streets.""

Some volunteers have recorded arrests in courtroom hallways, traumatic scenes that are proliferating online. How many similar scenes are happening nationwide remains unclear. The Executive Office for Immigration Review has not released numbers of cases dismissed or arrests made at or near immigration courts.

While most volunteers have done this work without incident, some have been arrested for interfering with ICE agents. New York City Comptroller and Democratic mayoral candidate Brad Lander was arrested after locking arms with a person in a failed attempt to prevent his detention. Lander’s wife, attorney Meg Barnette, had just joined him in walking migrants from a courtroom to the elevator.

Helping families find their relatives as they disappear

The volunteers' act of witnessing has proven to be important as people disappear into a detention system that can seem chaotic, leaving families without any information about their whereabouts for days on end.

In a waiting room serving New York City immigration courtrooms, a Spanish-speaking woman with long dark curly hair was sitting anxiously with her daughter after she and her husband had separate hearings. Now he was nowhere to be found.

The Rev. Fabián Arias, a volunteer court observer, said the woman whose first name is Alva approached him asking “Where is my husband?” She showed him his photo.

“ICE detained him,” Arias told her, and tried to comfort her as she trembled, later welling up with tears. A judge had not dismissed the husband’s case, giving him until October to find a lawyer. But that didn’t stop ICE agents from handcuffing him and taking him away as soon as he stepped out of court. The news sparked an outcry by immigration advocates, city officials and a congressman. At a news conference, she gave only her first name and asked that her daughter’s be withheld.

Brianna Garcia, a college student in El Paso, Texas, said she’s been attending immigration court hearings for weeks where she informs people of their rights and then records ICE agents taking people into custody.

“We escort people so they’re not harassed and help people memorize important phone numbers, since their belongings are confiscated by ICE,"" she said.

Paris Thomas began volunteering at the Denver immigration court after hearing about the effort through a network of churches. Wearing a straw hat, he recently waited in the midday heat for people to arrive for afternoon hearings.

Thomas handed people a small paper flyer listing their rights in Spanish on one side and English on the other. One man walking with a woman told him “thank you. Thank you.” Another man gave him a hug.

Denver volunteer Don Marsh said they offer to walk people to their cars after court appearances, so they can contact attorneys and family if ICE arrests them.

Marsh said he's never done anything like this before, but wants to do something to preserve the nation's “rule of law” now that unidentifiable government agents are “snatching” people off the streets.

“If we’re not all safe, no one’s safe,” he said.

Rome —

European countries hoping to mirror Italy’s controversial practice of sending some asylum seekers rescued at sea to overseas deportation centers have been dealt a setback by Europe’s top court.

On Friday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that while Italy could still utilize the centers it runs in the Albanian cities of Shengiin and Gjader, who can be sent there must be more closely examined to ensure that asylum seekers aren’t being sent back to dangerous situations in their home countries.

The court said that a country of origin can only be considered “safe” after it has been “subject to effective judicial review,” and that a country must be demonstrably safe for all its population, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.

The ECJ ruling will almost certainly impact new EU asylum regulations, which are set to take effect next June and are designed to allow member states to create their own “safe” country lists to expedite and outsource the asylum process.

The EU’s own list, meant to be a guide, includes Bangladesh, Columbia, Egypt, India, Kosovo, Morocco and Tunisia, despite human rights campaigners warning that those countries aren’t safe for all who live there.

“The proposed EU list of ‘safe countries of origin’ deems certain countries, from which 20% or fewer applicants are granted international protection in the EU, to be safe,” Amnesty International said in a July statement. “However, the fact that up to 20% of those applying for international protection from these countries are recognized as refugees indicates that these places are in fact not safe for all,” it added.

The ECJ ruling – which was based on two Bangladeshi asylum seekers who were detained in Albania but argued returning to Bangladesh was unsafe – comes as several European countries have expressed interest in developing their own deportation schemes like the Italian-Albanian partnership.

While that partnership, a multi-million-euro investment of detention centers and “return hubs” in a non-EU country, has been viewed by some countries as a potential blueprint for success, a recent study by the University of Bari found that the Italian scheme has, so far, cost the country more than €74.2 million (approximately $86 million).

The study called the scheme “the most costly, inhumane, and useless instrument in the history of Italian migration policies.”

Still, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and then European Council president Charles Michel lauded Italy’s 2023 landmark agreement, and in May 2024, the EU established a set of reforms designed to streamline Europe’s approach to managing migration and asylum, particularly around migrants from so-called “safe” countries.

Calling it “fair but firm,” the pact lays out wide-ranging reforms designed to ease the burden on countries that have historically taken the most asylum-seekers among the EU’s 27 member states.

Whether this ECJ ruling will dissuade the development of the detentions hubs remains to be seen.

Italy’s far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized the court’s decision as short sighted, saying that it “weakens policies to combat mass illegal immigration and protect national borders.”

“This is a development that should concern everyone – including the political forces rejoicing today over the ruling – because it further reduces the already limited scope for governments and parliaments to regulate and administer migration,” she said.

Meanwhile, in Italy’s detention centers in Albania, the lives of nearly a dozen people from countries deemed safe, including Egypt and Bangladesh, hang in the balance.",GNews,-6.23,,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnn-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.09,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/,https://ground.news/interest/cnn,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.7),USA,,TV Station/Website,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Turner Broadcasting System,1980,-1.3,Lean Left,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,edition.cnn.com,,cable news network,57,USA,Y,F,CNN,Y
215,266,DHS Faces New Pressure Over DNA Taken From Immigrant Children,https://www.wired.com/story/dhs-and-doj-face-new-pressure-over-collecting-childrens-dna/,2025-07-16T17:30:00Z,Wired,GB,immigration,"United States Senator Ron Wyden is pressing the United States Departments of Homeland Security and Justice to explain how and why they are collecting DNA from immigrants, including children, on a massive scale.

Wyden confronted the agencies with demands this week to explain the scope, legality, and oversight of the government’s DNA collection. In letters to the DOJ and DHS, the Oregon Democrat also criticized what he described as a “chilling expansion” of a sprawling and opaque system, accusing Trump administration officials of withholding even basic facts about its operation.

Citing recent data that shows the DHS took genetic samples from approximately 133,000 migrant children and teenagers—first reported by WIRED in May and made public through a Freedom of Information Act request filed by Georgetown Law—Wyden says the government has provided no “justification for the permanent collection of the children’s DNA samples.”

Their DNA profiles now reside in CODIS, an FBI database historically used to identify suspects in violent crimes. Critics argue the system—which retains information indefinitely by default—was never intended to hold genetic data from civil immigration detainees, especially minors.

In the last four years, DHS has collected DNA from tens of thousands of minors, among them at least 227 children aged 13 or younger, government data shows. The vast majority of those profiled—more than 70 percent—were citizens of just four countries: Mexico, Venezuela, Cuba, and Haiti.

“By including these children’s DNA in CODIS, their profiles will be queried every time a search is done of the database,” Wyden writes. “These children will be treated by law enforcement as suspects for every investigation of every future crime, indefinitely.”

The US government has been steadily positioning noncitizens at the forefront of a massive genetic surveillance regime for years, collecting DNA almost entirely from immigrants in civil custody, while feeding it into systems built for mostly criminal tracking.

Recent analysis by the Georgetown Law Center on Privacy and Technology reveals that more than a quarter million DNA samples have been processed and added to CODIS over the past four months alone, accelerating the crime-fighting tool’s transformation into a warehouse for migrant DNA.

Wyden has asked attorney general Pam Bondi and homeland security secretary Kristi Noem to release details on how, and under what legal authority, the DNA samples are gathered, stored, and used. He further pressed for data on the number of samples collected, especially from minors, and asked the officials to list by what policies DHS currently governs the coercion, expungement, and sharing of DNA data.

“When Congress authorized the laws surrounding DNA collection by the federal government over two decades ago, lawmakers sought to address violent crime,” Wyden says. “It was not intended as a means for the federal government to collect and permanently retain the DNA of all noncitizens.”

Natalie Baldassarre, a spokesperson for the DOJ, acknowledged that the agency had received Wyden’s inquiry but declined to comment further.

216,87,The IRS Is Building a Vast System to Share Millions of Taxpayers’ Data With ICE,https://gizmodo.com/the-irs-is-building-a-vast-system-to-share-millions-of-taxpayers-data-with-ice-2000631337,2025-07-18T15:15:56Z,Gizmodo.com,GB,immigration,"This story was originally published by ProPublica.

ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.

The Internal Revenue Service is building a computer program that would give deportation officers unprecedented access to confidential tax data.

ProPublica has obtained a blueprint of the system, which would create an “on demand” process allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to obtain the home addresses of people it’s seeking to deport.

Last month, in a previously undisclosed dispute, the acting general counsel at the IRS, Andrew De Mello, refused to turn over the addresses of 7.3 million taxpayers sought by ICE. In an email obtained by ProPublica, De Mello said he had identified multiple legal “deficiencies” in the agency’s request.

Two days later, on June 27, De Mello was forced out of his job, people familiar with the dispute said. The addresses have not yet been released to ICE. De Mello did not respond to requests for comment, and the administration did not address questions sent by ProPublica about his departure.

The Department of Government Efficiency began pushing the IRS to provide taxpayer data to immigration agents soon after President Donald Trump took office. The tax agency’s acting general counsel refused and was replaced by De Mello, who Trump administration officials viewed as more willing to carry out the president’s agenda. Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, and the IRS negotiated a “memorandum of understanding” that included specific legal guardrails to safeguard taxpayers’ private information.

In his email, De Mello said ICE’s request for millions of records did not meet those requirements, which include having a written assurance that each taxpayer whose address is being sought was under active criminal investigation.

“There’s just no way ICE has 7 million real criminal investigations, that’s a fantasy,” said a former senior IRS official who had been advising the agency on this issue. The demands from the DHS were “unprecedented,” the official added, saying the agency was pressing the IRS to do what amounted to “a big data dump.”

In the past, when law enforcement sought IRS data to support its investigations, agencies would give the IRS the full legal name of the target, an address on file and an explanation of why the information was relevant to a criminal inquiry. Such requests rarely involved more than a dozen people at a time, former IRS officials said.

Danny Werfel, IRS commissioner during the Biden administration, said the privacy laws allowing federal investigators to obtain taxpayer data have never “been read to open the door to the sharing of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of tax records for a broad-based enforcement initiative.”

A spokesperson for the White House said the planned use of IRS data was legal and a means of fulfilling Trump’s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations of “illegal criminal aliens.”

Taxpayer data is among the most confidential in the federal government and is protected by strict privacy laws, which have historically limited its transfer to law enforcement and other government agencies. Unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer return information is a felony that can carry a penalty of up to five years in prison.

The system that the IRS is now creating would give ICE automated access to home addresses en masse, limiting the ability of IRS officials to consider the legality of transfers. IRS insiders who reviewed a copy of the blueprint said it could result in immigration agents raiding wrong or outdated addresses.

“If this program is implemented in its current form, it’s extremely likely that incorrect addresses will be given to DHS and individuals will be wrongly targeted,” said an IRS engineer who examined the blueprints and who, like other officials, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

The dispute that ended in De Mello’s ouster was the culmination of months of pressure on the IRS to turn over massive amounts of data in ways that would redefine the relationship between the agency and law enforcement and reduce taxpayers’ privacy, records and interviews show.

In one meeting in late March between senior IRS and DHS officials, a top ICE official made a suggestion: Why doesn’t Homeland Security simply provide the name and state of its targets and have the IRS return the addresses of everyone who matches that criteria?

The IRS lawyers were stunned. They feared they could face criminal liability if they handed over the addresses of individuals who were not under a criminal investigation. The conversation and news of deeper collaboration with ICE so disturbed career staff that it led to a series of departures in late March and early April across the IRS’ legal, IT and privacy offices.

They were “pushing the boundaries of the law,” one official said. “Everyone at IRS felt the same way.”

The Blueprint

The technical blueprint obtained by ProPublica shows that engineers at the agency are preparing to give DHS what it wants: a system that enables massive automated data sharing. The goal is to launch the new system before the end of July, two people familiar with the matter said.

The DHS effort to obtain IRS data comes as top immigration enforcement leaders face escalating White House pressure to deport some 3,000 people per day, according to reports.

One federal agent tasked with assisting ICE on deportations said recent operations have been hamstrung by outdated addresses. Better information could dramatically speed up arrests. “Some of the leads that they were giving us were old,” said the agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press. “They’re like from two administrations ago.”

In early March, immigrants rights groups sued the IRS hoping to block the plan, arguing that the memorandum of understanding between DHS and the IRS is illegal. But a judge in early May ruled against them, saying the broader agreement complied with Section 6103, the existing law regulating IRS data sharing. That opened the door for engineers to begin building the system.

The judge did not address the technical blueprint, which didn’t exist at the time of the ruling. But the case is pending, which means the new system could still come under legal review.

Until now, little was known about the push and pull between the two agencies or the exact technical mechanics behind the arrangement.

The plan has been shrouded in secrecy even within the IRS, with details of its development withheld from regular communications. Several IRS engineers and lawyers have avoided working on the project out of concerns about personal legal risk.

Asked about the new system, a spokesperson for IRS parent agency the Treasury Department said the memorandum of understanding, often called an MOU, “has been litigated and determined to be a lawful application of Section 6103, which provides for information sharing by the IRS in precise circumstances associated with law enforcement requests.”

At a time when Trump is making threats to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens, the scope of information-sharing with the IRS could continue to grow, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica and sources familiar with the matter: DHS has been looking for ways to expand the agreement that could allow Homeland Security officials to seek IRS data on Americans being investigated for various crimes.

Last month, an ICE attorney proposed updating the MOU to authorize new data requests on people “associated with criminal activities which may include United States citizens or lawful permanent residents,” according to a document seen by ProPublica. The status of this proposal is unclear. De Mello, at the time, rejected it and called for senior Treasury Department leadership to personally sign off on such a significant change.

The White House described DHS’ work with the IRS as a good-faith effort to identify and deport those who are living in the country illegally.

“ProPublica continues to degrade their already terrible reputation by suggesting we should turn a blind eye to criminal illegal aliens present in the United States for the sake of trying to collect tax payments from them,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement after receiving questions about the blueprint from ProPublica.

She pointed to the April MOU as giving the government the authority to create the new system and added, “This isn’t a surveillance system. … It’s part of President Trump’s promise to carry out the mass deportation of criminal illegal aliens — the promise that the American people elected him on and he is committed to fulfilling.”

In a separate statement, a senior DHS official also cited the court’s approval of the MOU, saying that it “outlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer information is protected while allowing law enforcement to effectively pursue criminal violations.”

How the System Works

The new system would represent a sea change, allowing law enforcement to request enormous swaths of confidential data in bulk through an automated, computerized process.

The system, according to the blueprint and interviews with IRS engineers, would work like this:

First, DHS would send the IRS a spreadsheet containing the names and previous addresses of the people it’s targeting. The request would include the date of a final removal order, a relevant criminal statute ICE is using to investigate the individual, and the tax period for which information is sought. If DHS fails to include any of this information, the system would reject the request.

The system then attempts to match the information provided by the DHS to a specific taxpayer identification number, which is the primary method by which the IRS identifies an individual in its databases.

If the system makes a match, it accesses the individual’s associated tax file and pulls the address listed during the most recent tax period. Then the system would produce a new spreadsheet enriched with taxpayer data that contains DHS’ targets’ last known addresses. The spreadsheet would include a record of names rejected for lack of required information and names for which it could not make a match.

Tax and privacy experts say they worry about how such a powerful yet crude platform could make dangerous mistakes. Because the search starts with a name instead of a taxpayer identification number, it risks returning the address of an innocent person with the same name as or a similar address to that of one of ICE’s targets. The proposed system assumes the data provided by DHS is accurate and that each targeted individual is the subject of a valid criminal investigation. In effect, the IRS has no way to independently check the bases of these requests, experts told ProPublica.

In addition, the blueprint does not limit the amount of data that can be transferred or how often DHS can request it. The system could easily be expanded to acquire all the information the IRS holds on taxpayers, said technical experts and IRS engineers who reviewed the documents. By shifting a single parameter, the program could return more information than just a target’s address, said an engineer familiar with the plan, including employer and familial relationships.

Engineers based at IRS offices in Lanham, Maryland, and Dallas are developing the blueprint.

“Gone Back on Its Word”

For decades, the American government has encouraged everyone who makes an income in the U.S. to pay taxes — regardless of immigration status — with an implicit promise that their information would be protected. Now that same data may be used to locate and deport noncitizens.

“For years, the IRS has told immigrants that it only cares that they pay their taxes,” said Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is seeking to block the data-sharing agreement in federal court. “By agreeing to share taxpayer data with ICE on a mass basis, the IRS has gone back on its word.”

The push to share IRS data with DHS emerged while Elon Musk’s DOGE reshaped the engineering staff of the IRS. Sam Corcos, a Silicon Valley startup founder with no government experience, pushed out more than 50 IRS engineers and restructured the agency’s engineering priorities while he was the senior DOGE official at the agency. He later became chief information officer at Treasury. He has also led a separate IRS effort to create a master database using products from Silicon Valley giant Palantir Technologies, enabling the government to link and search large swaths of data.

Corcos didn’t respond to a request for comment. The White House said DOGE is not part of the DHS-IRS pact.

Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, which oversees the IRS, told ProPublica the system being built was ripe for abuse. It “would allow an outside agency unprecedented access to IRS records for reasons that have nothing to do with tax administration, opening the door to endless fishing expeditions,” he said.

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the department’s internal watchdog, is already probing efforts by Trump and DOGEto obtain private taxpayer data and other sensitive information, ProPublica reported in April.

The Trump administration continues to add government agencies to its deportation drive.

DOGE and DHS are also working to build a national citizenship database, NPR reported last month. The database links information from the Social Security Administration and the DHS, ostensibly for the purpose of allowing state and local election officials to verify U.S. citizenship.

And in May, a senior Treasury Department official directed 250 IRS criminal investigative agents to help deportation operations, a significant shift for two agencies that historically have had separate missions.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,

Show Caption Hide Caption ICE agent injury rates up in Trump's immigration crackdown Amid surging immigration enforcement, U.S. federal agents are being hurt and hospitalized in public and risky arrests.

President Donald Trump's ""border czar"" Tom Homan responded to the reported death of a Mexican farmworker following an immigration raid in California, calling the fatality ""unfortunate"" but defending Immigration and Customs Enforcement's actions in the area.

""It's sad. It's unfortunate,"" Homan told CNN's Dana Bash on ""State of the Union.""

""It's obviously unfortunate when there's deaths,"" he said. ""No one wants to see people die.""

Jaime Alanis, 57, died July 12 from injuries sustained the day before, when immigration agents swept through two cannabis farms north of Los Angeles and arrested around 200 people.

According to multiple reports, Alanis climbed to the roof of a greenhouse in alleged attempt to evade officers. He then fell about 30 feet and broke his neck. Alanis died the next day in an area hospital.

In his interview with CNN, Homan defended immigration officials, saying they were ""doing their job"" at the time of Alanis' fall.

""He wasn't in ICE custody,"" Homan said. ""ICE did not have hands on this person.""

Other workers were critically injured, according to United Farm Workers President Teresa Romero.

The enforcement sparked a chaotic scene at the cannabis farms, the USA TODAY Network in California reported. On the morning of July 10, immigration agents descended on Glass House Farms near Camarillo and in Carpinteria – a greenhouse complex that is one of the state's largest marijuana farms. They blocked the main road and clashed with protesters until after dark as agents detained farm workers.

The Department of Homeland Security said in a statement July 11 that, in addition to the arrests of undocumented workers, ""law enforcement rescued at least 10 migrant children from what looks like exploitation, forced child labor and potentially human trafficking or smuggling.""

Trump's immigration crackdown, a centerpiece of his reelection bid, has led to an increase in raids.

218,219,"Grok will no longer call itself Hitler or base its opinions on Elon Musk’s, promises xAI",https://www.theverge.com/x-ai/707442/grok-antisemitic-hitler-elon-musk-opinion-reprogrammed,2025-07-15T17:21:38Z,The Verge,GB,immigration,"is The Verge’s senior AI reporter. An AI beat reporter for more than five years, her work has also appeared in CNBC, MIT Technology Review, Wired UK, and other outlets.

xAI has offered a couple more fixes for “issues” with its Grok AI chatbot, promising it will no longer name itself “Hitler” or base its responses on searches for what xAI head Elon Musk has said.

According to an X post earlier today, the chatbot’s latest update sets new instructions that its responses “must stem from your independent analysis, not from any stated beliefs of past Grok, Elon Musk, or xAI. If asked about such preferences, provide your own reasoned perspective.”

The changes follow more than a week of controversy for Grok. In recent days, multiple reports showed that when asked its opinion about hot-button topics like Israel and Palestine, immigration, and abortion, the chatbot first searched for Musk’s opinion on the matter before responding. In its Tuesday post, xAI said that the reason for this was that when asked about its views, “the model reasons that as an AI it doesn’t have an opinion but knowing it was Grok 4 by xAI searches to see what xAI or Elon Musk might have said on a topic to align itself with the company.”

The company also addressed another controversy from over the weekend, in which Grok 4 Heavy, the chatbot’s $300-per-month subscription product, responded that its surname was “Hitler.” In the company’s statement, xAI said that it was due to media headlines responding to yet an earlier incident: Grok going off the rails in a multi-day series of tirades where it denigrated Jews and praised Hitler. (It also posted graphic sexual threats against a user.) Since Grok doesn’t have a surname, said xAI, it “searches the internet leading to undesirable results, such as when its searches picked up a viral meme where it called itself ‘MechaHitler.’” The new instructions should prevent this, according to the company.

Grok’s antisemitism isn’t limited to the recent past — in May, the chatbot went viral for casting doubt on Holocaust death tolls. But its responses escalated dramatically this month after a set of changes to its system prompts, including that it should “assume subjective viewpoints sourced from the media are biased” and that its response “should not shy away from making claims which are politically incorrect, as long as they are well substantiated.” The “politically incorrect” instruction was briefly removed before being re-added in recent days.

During the livestream release event for Grok 4 last week, Musk said he’s been “at times kind of worried” about AI’s intelligence far surpassing that of humans, and whether it will be “bad or good for humanity.”

“I think it’ll be good, most likely it’ll be good,” Musk said. “But I’ve somewhat reconciled myself to the fact that even if it wasn’t going to be good, I’d at least like to be alive to see it happen.”

Now, xAI says that after rolling out these latest updates, the company is “actively monitoring and will implement further adjustments as needed.”",NewsAPI,-7.27,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,38.1,"the verge, Verge, theverge.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/,https://ground.news/interest/the-verge,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/verge-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (1.1),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,theverge.com,,the verge,51,USA,,,,

A GB News guest was sparked fury in a fiery row over the ongoing migrant debate as the small boat migrant deportation scheme begins this week. During Tuesday’s visit (August 5) to the London studios, hosts Eamonn Holmes and Ellie Costello woke up the nation as they discussed the biggest stories hitting the headlines. It didn’t take long before conversation to the ongoing migrant crisis after the government released a statement warning anyone crossing the English Channel will face immediate detention and will return within days. To get a clearer perspective on the issue, the Irish broadcaster welcomed Charlie Rowley onto the programme. The former Conservative political advisor argued that the scheme is doomed to fail after pointing out that the maximum number of migrants the UK can deport is 2,300 despite the UK welcoming more than 25,000 illegal migrants this year so far.

GB News sparked fury online over new migrant scheme

Upon hearing the plan, Eamonn raged: ""What irritates me, amongst the many things that irritate me, is being lectured by the Prime Minister, the Home Secretary, or the Foreign Secretary, telling us that this is a really good deal for Britain. ""Why on earth? I mean, don’t you just want to say to these people: Do you think we’re all stupid?"" Political commentator Charlie Rowley argreed: ""I think that is absolutely right, because you can’t take the British public for fools. They can see through it whether the Government is on the ropes or trying to spin a fast one and they will see that this is not what the public wants. It’s not about 'one in, one out'. They just want the whole issue to stop. ""Trying to tell people on the one hand, that the riots we had last summer were all part of some far-right bandwagon, and now we’re seeing more peaceful protests, but protests nonetheless, on the back of illegal immigration, on the back of people's safety. ""You're hearing reports, not just of people who’ve come into the country and are getting free accommodation, healthcare, and £50 a week, while also working as food delivery drivers, but now we’re talking about individuals who haven’t even been prosecuted yet but are already charged with crimes against women and girls.

Former political advisor Charlie Rowley sparked fury on GB News

""That’s why the country is now at a tipping point. So the idea that the Prime Minister would say: ‘During this summer of discontent, let’s launch a one in, one out scheme, Prime Minister. That’ll tell the public. That’ll wash.’ It doesn’t."" It didn't take long before viewers flooded to X - formerly known as Twitter - to share their frustrations online, with one user posting: ""Shouldn't be taxpayers money spent on this, never."" Another agreed: ""Actions speak louder than words. And so far all we get from leftiests is all talk. No action. I don't care what the government says they're going to do. Actions are what matters."" A third chimed in with: ""Absolute farce and the whole country knows it! Why does this government think it can take us all for fools? Do they not realise they are the fools and we all know it!""

The number of asylum seeker applications in Germany has plummeted after a major crackdown. Figures reported by local media show there were 61,300 bids submitted in the first six months of this year. This is almost half the total for 2024, when numbers totalled 121,426. German Chancellor Friedrich Merz pledged to get a grip on immigration and border security when campaigning for election ahead of May's general election. Since gaining power, Germany has tightened its border controls, stopped family reunification and abolished a fast-track naturalisation process. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT

Alexander Dobrindt, Germany's Interior Minister, hailed the figures as ""clear successes"" in his country's ""migration turnaround"". He told Germany daily, BILD: ""We are consistently continuing on the path to turning migration on its head."" BILD hailed the figures for showing Germany was no longer the European country with the most asylum applications. The country has dropped to third behind Spain and France, which separate figures first reported by Welt am Sonntag show 76,020 and 75,428 applications respectively. Germany's figure, cited by that publication, is 65,495 asylum applications for the first half of this year. The figures come from a European Asylum Agency report. Most asylum seekers applying for asylum in Germany came from Afghanistan, Syria and Turkey, 22%, 20% and 11% respectively. Dozens of Afghan men were deported by Germany in July. 81 Afghans had been through the country's justice system and had their asylum applications rejected.

The Interior Ministry said the government aims to carry out more deportations to Afghanistan. Asylum applications fell from 329,120 in 2023 to 229,751 last year and have continued to fall this year. Germany's apparent success compares starkly with British efforts to crack down on irregular migration and secure UK borders. The latest Government figures available show a total of 109,343 people claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending March, 2025. This was 17% more than in the year ending March 2024 and 6% more than the previous peak of 103,081 in 2002. The Government's Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill has cleared the Commons, but must still undergo further scrutiny in the Lords before it becomes law. Shadow Justice Secretary Robert Jenrick said on Monday (August 4) that the public has run out of patience with the whole issue of illegal migration. Mr Jencrick, who was speaking after nationwide protests against migration, told the BBC: ""This is an issue that is beyond party politics. It is causing immense harm to communities and people's lives are being wrecked as a result of it and we simply have to fix it."" The Home Office announced on Monday that it is pouring £100million of extra funding into supporting a pilot scheme for a new ""one in, one out"" returns agreement between the UK and France on top of other efforts to crack down on small boat crossings. The cash will also pay for up to 300 more National Crime Agency (NCA) officers, new technology and equipment to step up intelligence-gathering on smuggling gangs. But pressure is mounting for the Government to devise a proper deterrent to stop the boats and bring down the numbers. The Conservatives criticised the funding announcement as a ""desperate grab for headlines which will make no real difference"". Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: ""Labour has failed and their laughable claim to smash the gangs lies in tatters. They have no serious plan, just excuses, while ruthless criminal gangs flood our borders with illegal immigrants. ""The British public deserves real action, not empty slogans and tinkering at the edges."" A Reform UK spokesperson said until the Government gets serious about deporting every migrant who crosses the Channel, nothing will change. They added: ""Only Reform will ensure the boats stop and every illegal that enters the country is sent home.""

A confrontation erupted Thursday between protesters and federal officials carrying out a raid on a Southern California farm, with authorities throwing canisters that sprayed what looked like smoke into the air to disperse the crowd.

Vehicles from Border Patrol and U.S. Customs and Border Protection blocked the road in a largely agricultural area of Camarillo lined with fields and greenhouses. There were military-style vehicles and a helicopter flying overhead.

Television images showed dozens of demonstrators gathered on a road between fields where uniformed officers stood in a line across from them. In other images, white and green smoke can be seen as protesters retreat. Other images showed protesters shouting at agents wearing camouflage gear, helmets and gas masks. It wasn't clear why the authorities threw the canisters or if they released chemicals like tear gas.

Another image from KTLA showed people sat against a wall with their hands bound in front of them; it wasn't clear if they were workers or protesters. A spokesperson for the Department of Homeland Security said they were executing a warrant at a marijuana facility.

Glass House Farms said on social media that it was visited Thursday by officials for Immigration and Customs Enforcement and ""fully complied with agent search warrants.""

It's legal to grow and sell cannabis in California with proper licensing. State records show the company has multiple active licenses to cultivate cannabis.

The company also has a permit to grow in Ventura County, and as of last year used half of the space for cannabis while half was dedicated to tomatoes and cucumbers, the Ventura County Star reported.

Judith Ramos said she received a call Thursday morning from her father, who worked in the tomato fields.

""He said immigration was outside his job, and if anything happened to take care of everything,"" Ramos said, her voice cracking.

The 22-year-old certified nurse assistant said she has two young siblings.

Ramos went to the farm and saw a busload of people being taken out. She was protesting alongside others when agents sprayed the deterrent.

""They didn't want us to get any closer, and they started firing,"" Ramos said. ""I got some in my eyes. I had to put milk on my face.""

Ramos said she does not know where her father is and had not had contact with him for more than an hour. His truck is still at the worksite, she said.

It was not immediately known which agencies participated in the raid.

The incident comes as federal immigration enforcement agents have ramped up arrests in Southern California, heading to car washes, farms and Home Depot parking lots to take people into custody while stoking widespread fear among immigrant communities.

The Trump administration has had the National Guard providing protection to federal immigration agents carrying out the raids, and this week it sent a large caravan with guns and horses to a park in Los Angeles.

Andrew Dowd, spokesperson for the Ventura County Fire Department, said they were dispatched around 12:15 p.m. Thursday to the area to provide emergency medical aid. Crews took three people to nearby hospitals, he said, and the incident is ongoing.

Dowd said he had no information on the types of injuries or medical emergencies sustained, and he did not have any details of the people sent to hospitals.

Corona's parent company says its sales have fallen, in part because Hispanic customers aren't buying as much beer.

The New York-based Constellation Brands posted its first quarter earnings on Tuesday, reporting $2.23 billion in beer sales in the quarter — a 2% decline from the year before.

The company said its top sales states, particularly ""zip codes with larger Hispanic populations,"" saw subdued spending. Hispanic customers make up about 50% of the company's beer consumer base, Constellation Brands' CEO, Bill Newlands, said in April's earnings call.

Newlands and the company's chief financial officer said in a joint commentary on Tuesday that the company had surveyed a group of its customers, both Hispanic and non-Hispanic. The execs wrote that survey results showed ""over 80% of the surveyed Hispanic and non-Hispanic consumers expressed concerns about the socioeconomic environment in the U.S.""

The survey results also showed that customers were reducing their group gatherings, both in public and at home, and avoiding shopping at convenience stores and gas stations.

Newlands said in the earlier April earnings call that more than half of their Hispanic customers were concerned about immigration changes.

Since the start of President Donald Trump's second term in January, he has cracked down on illegal immigration. In his campaign rally in November, he promised to carry out the ""largest deportation program"" in American history.

Business owners in neighborhoods with large immigrant populations previously told Business Insider they saw lower footfall because customers feared Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids.

Constellation Brands, which also owns the beer brand Modelo and the wine brand Kim Crawford, saw an overall 6% decline in sales in the latest quarter compared with the year before, with a total revenue of $2.52 billion.

The company's wines and spirits category performed worse than its beer category, with a 28% decrease in net sales in the quarter.

toggle caption Andrew Harnik/Getty Images

The Justice Department is aggressively prioritizing efforts to strip some Americans of their U.S. citizenship.

Department leadership is directing its attorneys to prioritize denaturalization in cases involving naturalized citizens who commit certain crimes — and giving U.S. attorneys wider discretion on when to pursue this tactic, according to a June 11 memo published online. The move is aimed at U.S. citizens who were not born in the country; according to data from 2023, close to 25 million immigrants were naturalized citizens.

At least one person has already been denaturalized in recent weeks. On June 13, a judge ordered the revocation of the citizenship of Elliott Duke, who uses they/them pronouns. Duke is an American military veteran originally from the U.K. who was convicted for distributing child sexual abuse material — something they later admitted they were doing prior to becoming a U.S. citizen.

Denaturalization is a tactic that was heavily used during the McCarthy era of the late 1940s and the early 1950s and one that was expanded during the Obama administration and grew further during President Trump's first term. It's meant to strip citizenship from those who may have lied about their criminal convictions or membership in illegal groups like the Nazi party, or communists during McCarthyism, on their citizenship applications.

Assistant Attorney General Brett A. Shumate wrote in the memo that pursuing denaturalization will be among the agency's top five enforcement priorities for the civil division.

""The Civil Division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence,"" he said.

The focus on denaturalization is just the latest step by the Trump administration to reshape the nation's immigration system across all levels of government, turning it into a major focus across multiple federal agencies. That has come with redefining who is let into the United States or has the right to be an American. Since his return to office, the president has sought to end birthright citizenship and scale back refugee programs.

But immigration law experts expressed serious concerns about the effort's constitutionality, and how this could impact families of naturalized citizens.

The DOJ memo says that the federal government will pursue denaturalization cases via civil litigation — an especially concerning move, said Cassandra Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University.

In civil proceedings, any individual subject to denaturalization is not entitled to an attorney, Robertson said; there is also a lower burden of proof for the government to reach, and it is far easier and faster to reach a conclusion in these cases.

Robertson says that stripping Americans of citizenship through civil litigation violates due process and infringes on the rights guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.

Hans von Spakovsky, with the conservative Heritage Foundation, supports the DOJ's denaturalization efforts. ""I do not understand how anyone could possibly be opposed to the Justice Department taking such action to protect the nation from obvious predators, criminals, and terrorists.""

As for the due process concerns, von Spakovsky said, ""Nothing prevents that alien from hiring their own lawyer to represent them. They are not entitled to have the government — and thus the American taxpayer — pay for their lawyer.""

""That is not a 'due process' violation since all immigration proceedings are civil matters and no individuals— including American citizens — are entitled to government-furnished lawyers in any type of civil matter,"" he said.

The DOJ and Trump White House declined to comment for this story.

Broad criteria

According to this new memo, the DOJ is expanding its criteria of which crimes put individuals at risk of losing their citizenship. That includes national security violations and committing acts of fraud against individuals or against the government, like Paycheck Protection Program loan fraud or Medicaid or Medicare fraud.

""To see that this administration is plotting out how they're going to expand its use in ways that we have not seen before is very shocking and very concerning,"" said Sameera Hafiz, policy director of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center, a national advocacy organization providing legal training in immigration law.

""It is kind of, in a way, trying to create a second class of U.S. citizens"" — where one set of Americans is safe and those not born in the country are still at risk of losing their hard-fought citizenship, she said.

Other immigration experts point to another part of the guidance, which gives U.S. attorneys broader discretion to determine other eligible denaturalization cases. ""These categories do not limit the Civil Division from pursuing any particular case,"" the memo states, and priorities for denaturalization can include ""any other cases referred to the Civil Division that the Division determines to be sufficiently important to pursue.""

Steve Lubet, professor emeritus at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law, said that language appears to grant the federal government ""wide discretion"" on deciding whom to target.

""Many of the categories are so vague as to be meaningless. It isn't even clear that they relate to fraudulent procurement, as opposed to post-naturalization conduct,"" he said.

Von Spakovsky argues, ""When we extend the opportunity for naturalization to aliens, we are granting them a great privilege — the privilege of becoming a U.S. citizen. Quite frankly, I don't think it matters whether someone was a human trafficker or a drug smuggler before they entered the country, while they were applying for citizenship, or after their naturalization.""

He continued, ""Anyone who has abused the privilege of the opportunity of becoming a U.S. citizen should have that citizenship revoked when they engage in such reprehensible behavior.""

Lubet, who has written extensively about denaturalization, also raised concerns about the potential impact on families — particularly children whose citizenship was derived through a parent whose naturalization was later revoked.

""What struck me is the ripple effect that this would have on children who were naturalized through their parents,"" he said. ""People who thought they were safely American and had done nothing wrong can suddenly be at risk of losing citizenship.""

The DOJ didn't respond to questions about how this could impact children of naturalized parents or what happens in cases where an individual would be left stateless by being denaturalized.

A slippery slope

The order to revoke the citizenship of Elliott Duke, the Army vet originally from the U.K., may be one of the first examples of the Trump administration's aggressive denaturalization efforts in Trump's second term.

In 2012, while serving in Germany, Duke began receiving and distributing child sexual abuse material via email and the internet, according to the DOJ.

In January the following year, Duke became a naturalized American citizen, but revoked their U.K. citizenship to do so.

The DOJ filed a legal case against Duke back in February of this year in Louisiana seeking Duke's denaturalization based both on the conviction for child sexual abuse material and the failure to disclose their crimes during the naturalization process.

In the months it took to get a decision on their case, Duke tried to get a defense attorney to help fight the case — to no avail, they told NPR. Duke was also unable to travel to Louisiana for the court proceedings.

""If you commit serious crimes before you become a U.S. citizen and then lie about them during your naturalization process, the Justice Department will discover the truth and come after you,"" Shumate, the assistant attorney general, said in a statement.

Duke is still trying to determine what options exist for an appeal and how this impacts their current prison term. But for now, Duke is effectively stateless.

""My heart shattered when I read the lines [of the order]. My world broke apart,"" Duke said.

Regardless of the crimes Duke committed, the situation sets a dangerous precedent, said Laura Bingham, executive director of the Temple University Institute for Law Innovation and Technology. If the government continues to open the question of citizenship up for people who have already received it, this creates a slippery slope for everyone, she said.

Citizenship ""is not supposed to be something that you can continuously open up for some people, and you can't for others,"" Bingham said.

Denaturalization goes back to McCarthy era

In a 2019 report co-authored by Robertson, (Un)Civil Denaturalization, she writes that denaturalization was wielded frequently as a political tool in the McCarthy era.

""At the height of denaturalization, there were about 22,000 cases a year of denaturalization filed, and this was on a smaller population. It was huge,"" she told NPR.

Sponsor Message

The Supreme Court stepped in and issued a ruling in 1967 that said that denaturalization is ""inconsistent with the American form of democracy, because it creates two levels of citizenship,"" Robertson explained.

""So the United States went from having 20,000 some cases of denaturalization a year to having just a handful, like 1, 2, 5, 6, very small numbers for years after 1967,"" Robertson said.

That is, until the Obama administration, which used new digital tools to find potential cases of naturalization fraud going back decades. Under Operation Janus, an initiative launched by immigration and justice officials in the Obama era, they claimed a national security interest in examining potential cases of immigration fraud that could be tied to terrorism.

Then Trump's first administration sought to significantly expand the government's use of denaturalization and chose to file denaturalization cases against individuals via civil courts rather than criminal.

Despite her concerns about the new criteria, Robertson is skeptical how many cases they would apply to.

""The thing is there just aren't very many cases that fit within [the Trump administration's] framework of priorities [for denaturalization],"" Robertson said.

""So if they're really intending maximal enforcement, I think what they're going to end up doing is focusing on people who have not committed any serious infraction, or maybe any infraction at all, but people for whom there is a possibility"" that there are grounds to revoke citizenship, Robertson said. ""It fits in with the other ways that we've seen immigration enforcement happening"" under this administration.

Enlarge this image toggle caption LA Johnson/NPR LA Johnson/NPR

The U.S. Education Department is releasing more than $5 billion in education grant funding to states.

In late June, the Trump administration told states it was withholding these previously approved federal grants for further review. That announcement came a day before the July 1 deadline when those funds have traditionally been disbursed. The decision left many school districts scrambling in the lead up to the school year.

Earlier this month, the administration announced it would release grant funding for before- and after-school programs. Now, according to Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the Education Department, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) ""has directed the Department to release all formula funds. The agency will begin dispersing funds to states next week.""

Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle lobbied to release the funds, citing financial strain on states and local communities. Several states have also sued the administration in an effort to get the funds released.

The grants that were held for review fund a wide range of education programs, including migrant education, services for English language learners and adult education.

The largest pot of grant money consisted of roughly $2.2 billion for professional development for educators. Tara Thomas, government affairs manager at The School Superintendents Association (AASA), told NPR districts often use these funds to help pay for continued teacher training.

""At the end of the day, it's really just funding that makes teachers better at their jobs,"" she said.

It's not the first time the Trump administration has singled-out these programs: The administration's proposed FY 2026 budget eliminated all the grants that had been frozen.

Show Caption Hide Caption VIDEO: Python hunters wrestle with giant snake, the longest python ever caught in Florida The snake measures at 19 feet long and tops the previous record of 18 feet, 10 inches from 2022. This python was captured in eastern Collier County. Special to naplesnews.com, Special to naplesnews.com

Florida's new migrant detention center, Alligator Alcatraz, is located in the Everglades and relies on the natural dangers of the area as an escape deterrent.

The center's location is home to Burmese pythons, an invasive species that can grow up to 19 feet long and weigh over 200 pounds.

While Burmese pythons pose a potential threat to humans, there have been no recorded fatalities in Florida.

Alligator Alcatraz is Florida's recently opened migrant detention center in the Everglades.

The center was the brainchild of Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, who announced the site in a video on X. In the video, Uthmeier said, ""You don't need to invest that much in the perimeter. People get out, there's not much waiting for them other than alligators and pythons.""

The Burmese python is one of the largest snakes in the world. Adult pythons average between 6 and 9 feet, though the longest ever caught in Florida was 19 feet. The heaviest was over 200 pounds.

Burmese pythons are an invasive species in Florida, with a population spread across more than 1,000 square miles of South Florida, including Everglades National Park and Big Cypress National Preserve.

According to FWC, Burmese pythons can consume meals equivalent to 100% their body mass. During a study, the Conservancy of Southwest Florida took part in, researchers realized that Burmese pythons can eat prey larger than previously thought when they observed a python ingesting a 77-pound white-tailed deer, which was 66.9 percent of the snake’s mass.

Burmese pythons can pose a threat to human safety. Attacks on humans are improbable but possible in any locality where the animals and people are present.

Here's what to know about the biggest Burmese pythons caught in Florida and how many there are in the Everglades:

What is Alligator Alcatraz?

Alligator Alcatraz is a temporary migrant detention center near the Florida Everglades.

The controversial center reportedly has a capacity of up to 3,000 detainees, housed in FEMA tents and trailers.

Where in Florida is Alligator Alcatraz?

Alligator Alcatraz was erected at the Miami-Dade Collier Training and Transition Airport, a 39-square-mile airport facility with a 10,500-foot runway in Ochopee, an unincorporated community in Collier County, Florida.

The facility is in the Big Cypress National Preserve, which borders Everglades National Park.

Longest, heaviest Burmese pythons ever caught in Florida?

Burmese pythons are among the largest snakes in the world, with adult animals averaging between 10 and 16 feet long, according to the University of Florida.

A group of python hunters caught the longest Burmese python ever measured on July 10, 2023, in the Big Cypress National Preserve in eastern Collier County.

The massive snake was 19 feet long.

The heaviest Burmese python ever recorded was caught by Conservancy of Southwest Florida biologists in the Florida Everglades in 2022. The colossal female python weighed an eye-popping 215 pounds and was nearly 18 feet long.

Has a Burmese python ever killed a human in Florida?

According to the U.S. Geological Survey, human fatalities from non-venomous snakes are rare, with an average of one or two per year worldwide.

There have been no human deaths from wild-living Burmese pythons in Florida.

And while python attacks on humans are unlikely, they're not impossible.

Per USGS, ""In suburban areas and parks in Florida that contain ponds, canals or other bodies of water where large snakes could feel at home, the situation is likely similar to that experienced with alligators: attacks are improbable but possible in any locality where the animals are present and people are also present. The simplest and most sure-fire way to reduce the risk of human fatalities is to avoid interacting with a large constrictor.""

How many pythons are in the Everglades?

It's hard to get an exact count, given the Burmese python's ability to live in various South Florida environments and the difficulty accessing some areas.

""Burmese pythons are hard to find due to their cryptic coloration and secretive behaviors, and their low detection probability is a major challenge to effective python control and research,"" according to Florida Fish and Wildlife.

However, conservative estimates by the USGS put the Burmese python population in the Florida Everglades region in the tens of thousands.

2025 Florida Python Challenge starts July 11

The 2025 Florida Python Challenge — a 10-day event to remove invasive Burmese pythons — starts at 12:01 a.m. July 11 and ends at 5 p.m. July 20.

Participants can win money prizes in several categories, including a $10,000 Ultimate Grand Prize.

The top prize of $10,000 goes to the person who catches the most pythons. Those with the most catches in the Novice, Professional and Military categories win $2,500, while runners-up in each group receive $1,500, and $1,000 is awarded for the longest pythons caught.

Burmese pythons captured in Florida must be humanely killed. While they are not protected in Florida, anti-cruelty law still applies.

On the hunt: These 5 python hunters have combined to capture almost 100 invasive snakes in 2025

What to do if you see a Burmese python?

229,269,Video showing migrant worker moved by forklift prompts action from South Korea's president,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/video-showing-migrant-worker-moved-120123200.html,2025-07-24T12:01:23Z,Yahoo Entertainment,GB,migrant,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) — South Korea's president ordered officials to find ways to prevent the mistreatment of migrant workers after a video showing a Sri Lankan worker being moved by a forklift while tied up at a South Korean factory sparked public outrage.

“After watching the video, I couldn't believe my eyes,” President Lee Jae Myung wrote Thursday in a Facebook post. “That was an intolerable violation and clear human rights infringement of a minority person.”

Lee also condemned the treatment of the worker during a Cabinet Council meeting and expressed concerns about South Korea’s international image. He ordered government ministries to investigate the working conditions of migrant workers and other minorities in South Korea and find realistic steps to end any abuse.

Lee and other officials didn't say the Sri Lankan worker was treated that way because he is a migrant worker. But the Labor Ministry said it views the incident as evidence that migrant workers in South Korea suffer poor treatment at some worksites, a view held by experts and activists.

South Korean human rights activists on Wednesday released the video filmed at a brick factory in the southwestern city of Naju in late February. They said it was filmed and provided by a fellow Sri Lankan worker. The video was being shared among rights groups before being made public.

The video shows a forklift driver, who has been identified as South Korean, lifting another worker who is bound with plastic wrap and tied to bricks. The driver moves him around the factory yard in the vehicle while the sound of laughter from another person can be heard.

The 31-year-old worker suffered the mistreatment for about five minutes as a punishment imposed by the South Korean forklift driver, who wasn’t happy with his brick wrapping skills, according to Mun Gil Ju, one of the local activists involved in the video's release.

The worker told reporters in a televised interview broadcast Thursday that he suffered stress and mental anguish as a result of the incident. The YTN television network, which broadcast the interview, blurred his face and didn't provide his name.

YTN also showed the unidentified head of the factory saying “we absolutely feel sorry for” the incident.

Naju city officials said the factory manager told them he had been informed the event was organized as a prank. But Mun said “binding a person with plastic wrap"" cannot be downplayed as a prank.

About 20 activists rallied in front of Naju's city hall on Thursday, demanding that authorities punish those responsible. In an editorial Friday, the local Kukmin Ilbo newspaper called the treatment of the man “a shameful"" incident indicative of how migrant workers are treated in South Korea.

The factory has about 24 workers, including seven from East Timor and Sri Lanka along with South Koreans. The Sri Lankan man still works for the factory, according to Naju officials.

The Labor Ministry said in a statement Thursday that it will launch an investigation into the factory and its treatment of foreign workers.

Hundreds of thousands of migrants, mostly from Southeast Asia and China, take low-paying or dangerous work at factories, farms, construction sites and other places in South Korea.

In 2024, South Korea's National Human Rights Commission said that deaths from workplace accidents among migrant workers jumped from 7% to 12.2% from 2010 to 2019, calling it “a disturbing upward trend.” A 2024 research report commissioned by the agency also said that migrant workers were more than three times likely to die in industrial accidents than their South Korean counterparts.",NewsAPI,-5.69,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/yahoo-news-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Skews Left,40.05,"yahoo entertainment, Yahoo Entertainment, Yahoo!

At a campaign-style speech at the Iowa state fairgrounds, Trump said he is working with the Homeland Security Department to help farmers who depend on migrant laborers for their seasonal needs. He said he will also work with the hotel industry on the issue.

Trump has been pursuing a hard-line policy on migration and his U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has been leading an effort to deport people who crossed into the United States illegally.

This has led to some complaints from farmers that their crops are at risk due to a depleted work force.

""We don't want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms,"" he added, speaking in a Midwestern state where farming is a dominant industry.

Americans have been left with little to do about the situation other than react with horror and amazement or, in the case of one TikToker, a desire to spin the dystopian situation into comedy gold.

Lisandra Vazquez, a TikTok comedian with nearly a million followers, recently decided to troll the president’s supporters by creating a website that appears to be a company offering guided tours of the draconian prison but, in reality, offers information about how to donate to progressive organizations like Planned Parenthood, Climate Power, and World Central Kitchen, a non-profit that provides food relief.

Vazquez launched a website, dubbed Terri’s Tourz, that, upon first glance, appears to be a tour guide company marketed to the MAGA crowd. “Making America Great, One Tour at a Time,” the site states. The site features what is obviously an AI-generated image of a folksy-looking white woman (who, the website visitor might safely assume, is Terri). However, when site visitors click on hyperlinks embedded in the site’s homepage (they offer options like “VIP Tour” and “Basic Tours”), they are simply directed to pictures of Donald Trump hanging out with Jeffrey Epstein.

Another page on the site offers visitors links to several liberal non-profits, with the note: “If you can’t donate money to these organizations, maybe you can volunteer time? If not time, then maybe sharing their pages? Often, just resharing posts from an organization can have a butterfly effect.”

A disclosure on the website clearly notes: “TerrisTourz.com is a satirical website created for entertainment purposes only. All characters, events, and scenarios—though occasionally inspired by real-life individuals or public commentary—are entirely fictional and exaggerated for comedic effect.” A different disclaimer encourages the visitor to “proceed with laughter.”

The real Alligator Alcatraz has been accused of holding detainees in inhumane conditions, without access to adequate food and water, CBS has reported. The facility was built by federal authorities over the course of only several days at a municipal airport in the Everglades, some 50 miles west of Miami.

232,87,Local Grifters Discover Superman Is From Another Planet,https://gizmodo.com/superman-fox-news-immigration-backlash-james-gunn-2000625700,2025-07-08T14:30:14Z,Gizmodo.com,GB,migrant,"It is unsurprising to anyone with even an iota of experience with Superman—whether they’ve picked up a comic, watched a TV show, or seen a movie at any point over the last nearly 90 years—that the character has had an immigration parallel at the heart of his story. A child of two worlds, created by immigrants, Kal-El’s escape from Krypton to find a home where he is raised to embrace the values of the American ideal is a touchstone that has been woven through almost a century of storytelling. And yet, every time a Superman story is ready to enter the mainstream, the culture war’s blindest of soldiers have to find a way to act surprised at the sheer lack of understanding they have with one of the most enduring characters of American popular culture.

With James Gunn’s Superman on the horizon, Fox News only just remembered the week before release to find an opportunity to lambast Gunn for comments he made in a profile for The Times recently, where he noted that Superman is “the story of America.”

“An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country, but for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost,” Gunn continued. This was, of course, enough for Fox’s Kellyanne Conway to declare the movie “Superwoke” in a brief screed in which she also complained about people not standing for the national anthem at baseball games.

“We don’t go to the movie theater to be lectured to and to have somebody throw their ideology onto us,” Conway complained. “I wonder if it will be successful.” As of last month, Superman was tracking to open between $90 and $135 million, giving it the potential to be one of the highest openings for a DC Comics adaptation.

Of course, Gunn’s comments are far from the first time he’s discussed Superman’s immigrant roots—it’s a beat he’s touched on throughout the film’s production—nor is this a particularly obscure fact about the character. Almost every adaptation of Superman grapples with the character’s place as an alien on earth, but there’s little point in educating Fox News talking heads about the fundamentals of a character they supposedly care about enough to critique in this manner.

This is precisely the point of the right-wing culture war: to pretend and act shocked when they’ll just as readily move on to the next thing to be outraged at soon enough. Superman himself is no stranger to this kind of controversy, especially as the character has grappled with his relationship to American symbolism in the 21st century, from his renouncing of his U.S. citizenship in 2011 to DC’s move to rebrand Superman’s values as “Truth, Justice, and a better tomorrow” rather than the “American way.”

In an era where some studios seem eager to capitulate to the Trump administration’s war on diversity, however, sometimes it’s just refreshing to watch people clown on losers.

“I’m not here to judge people,” Gunn told Variety of the supposed “backlash” to his immigration comments at Superman‘s Hollywood premiere last night. “I think this is a movie about kindness and I think that’s something everyone can relate to.”

“We support our people, you know? We love our immigrants. Yes, Superman is an immigrant, and yes, the people that we support in this country are immigrants and if you don’t like that, you’re not American,” Gunn’s brother Sean, who plays Maxwell Lord in the film, added. “People who say no to immigrants are against the American way.”

But perhaps Nathan Fillion put it best, though. “Aw, somebody needs a hug. It’s just a movie, guys.”",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,

161,125,Thailand and Cambodia agree to a ceasefire in their deadly border clashes,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-07-28/thailand-cambodia-ceasefire,2025-07-28T15:35:47Z,Los Angeles Times,US,border,"Malaysia’s Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, center, looks on as Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Manet, left, and Thailand’s acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai, right, take part in talks on a possible ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia in Putrajaya on Monday.

Thailand and Cambodia agreed Monday to an unconditional ceasefire during a meeting in Malaysia, in a significant breakthrough to resolve five days of deadly border clashes that have killed dozens and displaced tens of thousands.

Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Thai Acting Prime Minister Phumtham Wechayachai agreed to a halt in fighting, starting at midnight, while appearing with Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim during a meeting held under U.S. pressure in the Malaysian administrative capital of Putrajaya. The Cambodian and Thai leaders hailed the meeting’s outcome and shook hands at the end of a brief news conference.

An Associated Press journalist in Cambodia reporting from close to the border with Thailand where artillery duels had been taking place said the sounds of shelling stopped about 10 minutes before the ceasefire came into effect. Reports from other fronts in the fighting were not immediately available.

The fighting began Thursday after a land mine explosion along the border wounded five Thai soldiers. Both sides blamed each other for starting the clashes, which have killed at least 35 people and displaced more than 260,000 people on both sides.

Anwar, who hosted the talks as annual chair of the Assn. of Southeast Asian Nations regional bloc, said both sides have reached a common understanding to take steps to return to normalcy following what he called frank discussions.

“This is a vital first step towards de-escalation and the restoration of peace and security,” Anwar said.

The Malaysian meeting followed direct pressure from President Trump, who warned that the U.S. might not proceed with trade deals with either country if hostilities continue, giving both sides a face-saving justification for backing away from the fighting. In a statement later Monday on social media, Trump said the two sides had “reached a CEASEFIRE and PEACE... I am proud to be the President of PEACE!”

As part of the ceasefire deal, military commanders from both sides will hold talks Tuesday to defuse tensions while Cambodia will host a border committee meeting on Aug. 4. Anwar said. The foreign and defense ministers of Malaysia, Cambodia and Thailand have also been instructed to “develop a detailed mechanism” to implement and monitor the ceasefire to ensure sustained peace, he added.

Hun Manet said he hoped that bilateral ties could return to normal soon so that almost 300,000 villagers evacuated on both sides could return home.

It is “time to start rebuilding trust, confidence and cooperation going forward between Thailand and Cambodia,” he said.

Phumtham said the outcome reflected “Thailand’s desire for a peaceful resolution.”

The joint statement on the agreement said that the United States was a co-organizer of the talks, with participation from China. The Chinese and American ambassadors to Malaysia attended the meeting that lasted more than two hours.

In a press statement, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who was involved in arranging the meeting, applauded the ceasefire declaration. Rubio said he and Trump “are committed to an immediate cessation of violence and expect the governments of Cambodia and Thailand to fully honor their commitments to end this conflict.”

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt posted news of the ceasefire on X and wrote: “President Trump made this happen. Give him the Nobel Peace Prize!”

Phumtham said after his return to Bangkok that Trump had called to offer congratulations for making a move toward peace. He also said Trump told him that Thailand’s talks with Washington to set tariff levels on Thai exports could now proceed and that he would seek to make them as favorable as possible.

A summary of the call from Phumtham’s office said the prime minister thanked the president for his “important role” in seeking to resolve the crisis and declared that Trump would be honored and remembered in Thailand for his effort.

The violence of recent days marked a rare instance of open military confrontation between ASEAN member states, a 10-nation regional bloc that has prided itself on nonaggression, peaceful dialogue and economic cooperation. Both countries recalled their ambassadors and Thailand shut all border crossings with Cambodia, with an exception for migrant Cambodian workers returning home.

News of the ceasefire deal brought relief and hope to evacuees from both sides. Some women at a crowded evacuation shelter in Surin, Thailand, shouted for joy.

“I’m happy about that, and feeling a bit relieved,” said Usa Dasri, a vendor and farmer. “We miss our home. There are many small things I’m worried about, livestock and rice fields. I don’t know what might’ve happened to them. I want to go home, so I’m happy. I also think about our soldiers at the frontline. I want them to be safe and have a good sleep like us.”

She also credited outside diplomacy for the breakthrough.

“Without them, our two countries would have had a hard time negotiating — both sides have quite a hard time talking and understanding each other,” she added.

Cambodian evacuees echoed the sentiment.

Chhuot Nhav, 42, who fled her home in Oddar Meanchey province, a frontline for the fighting, said she was happy but also wary.

“I am happy because I can go home and take care of my pig, dog, chickens and my kids can now go back to school,” said Chhuot Nhav, from under a series of green tarps that stretched out to the length of a school bus. But she said she will “wait until the fighting really stops” before heading back.

Another farmer, Kong Sin, however, said he would head back home Tuesday if the ceasefire took place as agreed.

The 500-mile frontier between Thailand and Cambodia has been disputed for decades, but past confrontations have been limited and brief. The latest tensions erupted in May when a Cambodian soldier was killed in a confrontation that created a diplomatic rift and roiled Thailand’s domestic politics.

Officers intervened as men, women and children were about to leave the beach, slashing the boat with a knife as it sat in very shallow water.

All the people on board were able to make their way safely to shore.

With a sharp rise in numbers making the illegal crossing this year, the incident demonstrates the huge challenge that authorities face in trying to stop the smuggling operations that profit from the route, and the difficulties French police.

Officers are prevented by law from intervening once a boat is in the water, and operate on a very lengthy expanse of French coastline where crossings depart.

Parents are being prevented from vaccinating their children because of obstacles such as difficulty booking appointments and a lack of reminders on what jabs are needed and when, a report suggests. Child health experts say ""practical or logistical reasons"" are discouraging families more often than fears over the vaccines. Vaccine uptake in the UK has fallen over the last decade, leading to outbreaks of measles and whooping cough. UK health officials say they are committed to working with the NHS to improve vaccine uptake among children.

'Easier access'

Since 2022, no childhood vaccine in the UK has met the World Health Organisation target of 95% of children vaccinated, which ensures protection of vulnerable people. As a result, measles and other preventable diseases have made a comeback. A commission of experts from the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) spent a year looking at why. Dr Helen Stewart, officer for health improvement at RCPCH, said the steady decline in vaccination rates in a wealthy country like the UK was ""extremely concerning"". But she said vaccine hesitancy, when parents waver over getting their children vaccinated, ""is only part of a very complex picture"". ""The reality is that there are many who simply need better support and easier access to appointments,"" Dr Stewart said. Although confidence in vaccines is still relatively high, the report found barriers to accessing jabs are why many families don't protect their children. Some of the most common barriers include: difficulties getting through to book appointments at GP surgeries

difficulties getting time off work for appointments

limited transport options or no parking at GP surgeries

not seeing the same GP each time so lack of trust

not being able to speak to a GP or nurse to ask about the vaccines

lack of reminders for jabs being sent out from GP

not enough clear information about what jabs their child needs and when ""One of the findings of this new report is that parents have no easy way to check their child's vaccination status,"" says children's emergency medicine specialist, Dr Stewart. ""When I ask if the child is up to date with their vaccinations, the most common response is 'I think so'."" Poorer families, some ethnic minority groups and migrant communities are much less likely to be vaccinated, and these inequalities have become more obvious since the pandemic, the report says. It also notes an absence of health visitors often means parents have no one they feel comfortable discussing vaccines openly with.

Listen to Paul read this article Few scenes convey British pomp and soft power more than the King and Queen in a carriage procession through the picturesque streets of Windsor. They are being joined on Tuesday by Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron for the first state visit by a French president since 2008, and the first by a European Union leader since Brexit. The Prince and Princess of Wales will be there too - a Royal Salute will be fired and Macron will inspect a guard of honour. But at a time of jeopardy in Europe, this three-day visit to Windsor and London promises much more than ceremony. There is a genuine hope that the coming days will make a difference to both countries.

Getty Images Macron and Starmer joined the German chancellor on a train ride to Kyiv recently, sending a powerful message of support for Ukraine at a time when US commitment appeared to be flagging

Macron will address MPs and peers at Westminster, and he and Brigitte will be treated to a state banquet back at Windsor. The trip will culminate with a UK-France summit, co-chaired by Sir Keir Starmer and Macron, during which the two governments hope to reach an agreement on the return of irregular migrants. They will also host Ukraine's leader by video as they try to maintain arms supplies to his military. But the wider question is how closely aligned they can really become, and whether they can put any lingering mistrust after Brexit behind them. And, given that the trip will involve much pageantry - with the tour moving from the streets of Windsor, the quadrangle of the Castle and later to the Royal Gallery of the Palace of Westminster - how crucial is King Charles III's role in this diplomacy?

Resetting a 'unique partnership'

It was less than two months ago that the UK and EU agreed to ""reset"" relations in London. Ties with France in particular had warmed considerably, driven partly by personal understanding but also strategic necessity. The two neighbours have much in common: they are both nuclear powers and members of the United Nations Security Council. They are also both looking to update a 15-year-old defence pact known as the Lancaster House treaties, which established a 10,000-strong Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF), and they have recently been working on broadening it to include other Nato and European countries.

Getty Images Macron has seen much of Sir Keir lately at summits in London, Canada and The Hague - and Starmer has visited France five times since becoming PM

""It has always been a unique partnership,"" says former French ambassador to the UK Sylvie Bermann. ""I think this partnership will be crucial in the future."" All of this is unlikely to escape the notice of US President Donald Trump, who is also promised a state visit, his second to the UK, probably in September.

King Charles is 'more than a figurehead'

King Charles, who is 76, has already navigated some complex royal diplomacy this year. Macron was the first European leader to visit Trump in the White House in February, but it was Sir Keir who stole the show days later, handing him a personal invitation from the King. Then, when Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky returned to Europe fresh from a bruising meeting with Trump at the White House in February, it was King Charles who welcomed him to Sandringham, and then met him again at Windsor in June. He has spoken in the past of the heroism of Ukrainians in the face of ""indescribable aggression"". Even before ascending the throne, King Charles amassed decades of experience in international affairs (he is also fluent in French). He was only 21 when he attended the funeral in 1970 of Charles de Gaulle, the wartime general who became the architect of France's current Fifth Republic.

He went on to become the longest-serving Prince of Wales in history, and now he is King he has weekly audiences with the prime minister. ""The choreography is a strange dance, I suspect, between Number Ten and the Palace,"" says royal commentator Richard Fitzwilliams. ""There's no doubt at all that Charles is considerably more than a figurehead."" Windsor Castle, which dates back to the first Norman king, William the Conqueror, has hosted French presidents before. But there is a quiet significance in the appearance of the Prince and Princess of Wales in welcoming Emmanuel and Brigitte Macron, as Catherine recovers from treatment for cancer. Between them, the King and Macron have played their part in resetting relations between the two neighbours, and by extension with the European Union too.

The King is a francophile, says Marc Roche, a columnist and royal commentator for French media: ""He has always had a good relationship with France."" A year after the death of Queen Elizabeth II, it was France that King Charles and Queen Camilla chose for their first state visit in September 2023. Macron had reminded the world in 2022 that the late Queen had ""climbed the stairs of the Élysée Palace"" six times - more than any other foreign sovereign. His words were warmly received in the UK. The King received a standing ovation after an address in French to the Senate, and the Queen played table tennis at a sports centre with Brigitte Macron. France's first lady has since visited her in London for a cross-Channel book award. Gentle touches they may have been, but it followed a very rough period in Franco-British relations.

Brexit negotiations soured relations

The mood had soured during negotiations over Brexit, which the French president said was based on a lie. Then four years ago, Australia pulled out of a deal to buy 12 French submarines and signed a defence pact with the UK and US instead. The French foreign minister called it a ""stab in the back"". Boris Johnson, who was prime minister at the time, told the French they should ""prenez un grip"" and ""donnez-moi un break"".

Getty Images French-British relations soured during negotiations over Brexit, which Macron (pictured with Johnson in 2020) said was based on a lie

It had been Macron's idea for a European Political Community (EPC) in 2022 that brought the UK into a broad group of countries all seeking to respond to Russia's full-scale invasion. In 2023 the then-Prime Minister, Rishi Sunak, sought to turn the page on several years of frosty relations at a Franco-British summit in Paris. British and French prime ministers have come and gone: the UK had three in 2022, and last year France had four. It was Sunak's team that organised last year's EPC summit at Blenheim, but it was Starmer as new prime minister who chaired it. Sébastien Maillard, who helped advise the French presidency in setting up the EPC, said he believed ""on both sides there is still a lack of trust… The memory of these difficult times has not vanished"". ""Trust needs time to build and perhaps the Russian threat, support for Ukraine and how to handle Trump are three compelling reasons to rebuild that trust,"" says Maillard, who is now at the Chatham House think tank.

Susi Dennison, of the European Council on Foreign Relations in Paris, agrees relations with France are not back to pre-Brexit levels, but suggests some things the UK and France are ""bickering"" about were being argued over even before the Brexit vote. For Macron, this is a chance to not only improve the relationship but also to shine on the international stage when his popularity at home has sunk, Mr Roche believes. ""It's a very important visit, especially the first day, because the French are fascinated by the Royal Family."" After eight years in power, Macron's second term still has almost two years to run, but he has paid the price politically for calling snap elections last year and losing his government's majority. His prime minister, François Bayrou, faces a monumental task in the coming months in steering next year's budget past France's left-wing and far-right parties. As president, Macron's powers - his domaine réservé - cover foreign policy, defence and security, but traditionally France's prime minister does not travel with the head of state, so Macron comes to the UK with a team of ministers who will handle far more than international affairs.

The difficult question of migration

During the summit, the two teams will also work on nuclear energy, artificial intelligence and cultural ties. Differences still have to be sorted over ""post-Brexit mobility"" for students and other young people, and France is expected to push the Starmer government on that. But most of the headlines on Thursday's UK-France summit will cover the two main issues: defence and migration. Defending Ukraine will take pride of place. An Élysée Palace source said it would discuss ""how to seriously maintain Ukraine's combat capability"" and regenerate its military. ""On defence our relationship is closer than any other countries,"" says former ambassador Sylvie Bermann. ""We have to prepare for the future… to strengthen the deterrence of Europe.""

Getty Images Both countries want to sign an agreement on migrant returns. More than 20,000 people have arrived in the UK in small boats in the first six months of 2025

And if a ceasefire were agreed in Ukraine, the two countries could provide the backbone of the ""reassurance force"" being proposed by the ""coalition of the willing"". Sir Keir and Macron have played a prominent part in forming this coalition, but so too have the military chiefs of staff of both countries. Migration is the stickiest problem the two countries face, however. How they deal with their differences on it - particularly on small boats - is crucial to their future relationship. They are especially keen to sign an agreement on migrant returns and on French police stopping people boarding ""taxi boats"" to cross the Channel. France has long argued that the UK has to address the ""pull factors"" that drive people to want to risk their lives on the boats - the UK, for its part, already pays for many of the 1,200 French gendarmes to patrol France's long northern coastline to stop the smugglers' boats.

Getty Images King Charles previously called on France and the UK to find common ground ""to reinvigorate our friendship""

The countries are believed to have been working on the terms of a ""one-in, one-out"" agreement, so that for every small-boat arrival in the UK that France takes back, the UK would allow in one asylum seeker from France seeking family reunification. Several countries on the southern coasts of Europe are unimpressed because it could mean France sending those asylum seekers handed back by the UK on to their country of entry into the EU, bordering the Mediterranean. In the UK, the opposition Conservatives have branded the idea ""pathetic"", accusing the government of a ""national record - for failure"" on curbing small-boat crossings. And yet every country in Europe is looking for a way to cut illegal border crossings. Meghan Benton, of the Migration Policy Institute, believes a Franco-British deal could work as a possible pilot for the rest of Europe: ""What works for the Channel could also work for the Mediterranean."" Any agreement on this tricky issue could also signal a real, practical improvement in the countries' political relationship. France's right-wing Interior Minister, Bruno Retailleau, has already been working with Labour's Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to try to find a workable solution. How far they get, and its wider impact on Europe, is still to be decided, but it does reflect a new willingness between the two neighbours to tackle the divisions between them. Boris Johnson once accused France of wanting to punish the UK for Brexit. That difficult chapter appears to be over. As Susi Dennison puts it: ""There's a certain distance that will always be there, but things are operating quite well."" During King Charles' 2023 state visit to France he called on the two countries to find common ground, ""to reinvigorate our friendship to ensure it is fit for the challenge of this, the 21st Century"". And so this visit will help show - both in the relationships between individuals and on concrete policy debates - whether his call has been answered.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,
444,125,Court limits Italy’s fast-track return of rejected asylum seekers to ‘safe’ countries,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-08-01/court-limits-italys-fast-track-return-of-rejected-asylum-seekers-to-safe-countries,2025-08-01T19:22:51Z,Los Angeles Times,US,asylum,"Migrants follow the authorities after their arrival in the port of Shengjin, northwestern Albania in January.

Judges at the European Union’s top court ruled Friday that Italy may fast-track the deportation of migrants to countries it deems “safe,” but only under certain conditions.

The Court of Justice of the European Union was asked to weigh in on whether Italy’s accelerated asylum process — used to swiftly return migrants from countries not experiencing war or major crises — complies with EU law.

The case centered on two Bangladeshi nationals rescued at sea by the Italian navy last year and transferred to a detention center in Albania. Because Bangladesh appears on Italy’s list of “safe” countries, their asylum claims were fast-tracked and ultimately rejected.

Italy’s government, led by Premier Giorgia Meloni, introduced the fast-track system and offshore detention centers in Albania as part of a broader strategy to reduce migration. Both measures have drawn widespread criticism.

Italian courts have ruled against the policies and referred several cases to the EU’s court in Luxembourg for clarification.

Opposition politicians say the scheme is expensive, complicated and damaging to migrants’ rights. A non-governmental delegation observing the process in Albania says it illegally deprives migrants of assistance during their asylum procedures.

The Luxembourg-based court on Friday said that while having a fast-track procedure doesn’t violate EU law, the designation of safe countries must be subject to judicial scrutiny so migrants can challenge their asylum decisions.

Meloni’s office expressed surprise at the ruling, insisting Italy’s migration policy is the purview of the executive and legislative branches and shouldn’t be subject to judicial review.

The decision “weakens policies to counter mass illegal immigration and defend national borders,” Meloni’s office said in a statement, adding that it “further reduces the already narrow margins of autonomy of governments and parliaments” to control migration.

Advocates for migrants heralded the decision. The Italian branch of Doctors Without Boarders said the decision created “a clear principle” that EU member states cannot declare a country safe without judicial review. “It is no longer possible to use opaque legislative acts lacking verifiable sources to justify the swift rejection of protection applications,” the group said.

The court ruling also noted a country cannot be deemed safe if there is insufficient protection for vulnerable groups. The country in question must be “safe for its entire population and not just for part of it,” the 22-page decision says.

An Italian court held last year that migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt couldn’t be immediately returned because those countries are not safe enough.

Judges at the Rome District Court, which referred the case to Luxembourg, will have the final say in determining whether the procedure was correctly applied for the two Bangladeshi nationals.

Over 200 migrants who were sent to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison under accusations that they were members of a violent criminal gang are the responsibility of the United States, the government of El Salvador told a United Nations working group.

El Salvador's claims, outlined in a report submitted Monday in court, appear to contradict what President Donald Trump and administration officials have been saying for months: that they are unable to return any of the migrants sent to CECOT because they're under El Salvador's authority.

""In this context, the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities, by virtue of international agreements signed and in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and international cooperation in criminal matters,"" El Salvador officials said in their report to the U.N.

El Salvador's comments were made in a report submitted in a court filing by the United Nations Office of The High Commissioner for Human Rights Working Group, which was investigating the ""disappearances"" of four Venezuelan men who were thought to have been sent to the country in March.

To date, the Trump administration has not released a list of those sent to El Salvador.

""The Salvadoran State emphatically states that its authorities have not arrested, detained, or transferred the persons referred to in the communications of the Working Group, "" the El Salvador officials said in the report. ""The actions of the State of El Salvador have been limited to the implementation of a bilateral cooperation mechanism with another State, through which it has facilitated the use of the Salvadoran prison infrastructure for the custody of persons detained within the scope of the justice system and law enforcement of that other State.""

The Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act -- an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process -- to deport two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members to El Salvador by arguing that the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua is a ""hybrid criminal state"" that is invading the United States.

The migrants were sent to CECOT as part of a $6 million deal the Trump administration made with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele for El Salvador to house migrant detainees as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.

Attorneys for the ACLU who are representing the original case challenging the AEA removals -- filed in March as the men were en route to CECOT -- said they became aware of the document last week through one of the families of the men.

The attorneys accuse the government of withholding the information despite previous requests the ACLU made for documents related to the administration's arrangement with El Salvador.

""The government of El Salvador has confirmed what everyone already knew: the United States controls the fate of the Venezuelans sent to CECOT without due process,"" Lee Gelernt, an attorney for the ACLU told ABC News in response to the U.N. report. ""Unbelievably, the U.S. government didn't provide this information to us or the court.""

240,269,Trump administration freezes $6.8 billion in federal education funds; California hit hard,https://www.yahoo.com/news/trump-administration-freezes-6-8-032205370.html,2025-07-01T03:22:05Z,Yahoo Entertainment,GB,migrant,"The Trump administration on Monday moved to withhold a projected $6.8 billion nationwide in education funds — including at least $811 million from California — money appropriated by Congress to help students who are learning English and those who are from migrant families, as well as funds to boost teacher training, after-school programs and classroom technology.

The administration on Tuesday morning emphasized that no final decision had been made on the release of the funds, and cited instances in which some of the money had been used in ways contrary to its policies.

Although the frozen funds make up less than 1% of California's total education budget, they have an outsize cumulative effect. And they involve dollars that already have been accounted for in terms of staff hired and programs planned.

“There have been many rumors about the Trump Administration cutting education funding, and now that rumors have become reality, it is worse than we imagined,"" said state Supt. of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond. ""Trump is illegally impounding billions of dollars appropriated by Congress to serve students this fiscal year.""

""This illegal action will harm students starting now,"" Thurmond added. ""It cannot stand!”

Thurmond and L.A. schools Supt. Alberto Carvalho, speaking in separate news conferences, said they and other California officials, are prepared to pursue legal action. Carvalho said he'd spoken with Gov. Gavin Newsom, who had agreed that the federal action was illegal.

The American Federation of Teachers decried what it called a ""decision to illegally freeze essential funding.""

A senior Trump administration official, speaking on a not-for-attribution basis, objected to the use of the word ""freeze"" by those critical of the move.

""We are conducting a programmatic review and no decision has been made yet,"" the official said.

In an 84-word Monday communication to states, the administration listed the affected programs by their federal designation, including Title III-A, which supports students who are learning English. Also listed was Title I-C, which aims to help the children of migrant workers overcome learning challenges. Both programs had all their funds withheld.

Other similarly affected programs were: Title II-A, which provides training for teachers and administrators; Title IV-A, for enhancing the use of technology for academic achievement and digital literacy, and Title IV-B, for before- and after-school and summer programs.

The federal notification concluded: ""The Department remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President’s priorities and the Department’s statutory responsibilities.”

The programs noted in the email make up more than 10% of federal spending on K-12 schools in 33 states, according to Learning Policy Institute, a California-based nonprofit.

For some school systems, the federal hold is expected to lead to immediate disruption and layoffs. The Los Angeles Unified School District, however, will use reserves for affected programs while pushing for the release of the federal funds. Ultimately, these funds are paying for hundreds of positions within the nation's second-largest school system.

The targets of the federal action are not especially surprising — all of the withheld funds are from programs the administration wants to slash or eliminate. And those details — and the justification for them — are clearly spelled out in President Trump's budget proposal for the next federal fiscal year, which begins in October.

But the Trump administration is holding back funds that Congress approved for the fiscal year already in progress, which began in October 2024. Because of the way federal, state and local budgets line up, this money was due to reach states Tuesday and to be spent as part of the budget for the school district fiscal year, which also began Tuesday.

School districts — on the expectation they would receive these funds appropriated by Congress — have generally already hired those expected to carry out these programs; many are long-standing efforts.

The Education Department declined to comment late Monday — referring inquiries to the Office of Management and Budget.

The official with OMB elaborated on some of the preliminary findings Tuesday morning related to the funding to help students who are learning English.

""This grant funding, in many cases, was used by states to provide often separate and segregated academic instruction to new English learners, which is in conflict with what the president ran on, what his agenda is. ... He did not want to promote multilingual schools. And, obviously, illegal immigration ties in with this,"" the administration official said.

This analysis is supported by the existence of newcomer schools and programs, including in the Los Angeles school system. School district officials, however, have described these programs as intensive, shorter-term efforts that allow students to more quickly integrate effectively into the main education program.

The Trump administration official also cited examples of funding allegedly being used improperly.

""This funding has been used to essentially advocate for illegal immigration,"" the official said. One instance, he said, ""was the production of this newcomer toolkit, which described illegal immigration as, quote, a healthy contribution to democracy.""

In another instance, the official said, a large school system in the eastern United States ""took some of this grant money, ostensibly to support English-language learners, to provide funding for illegal immigrant advocacy organizations, providing legal aid and other things to illegal immigrants.""

The administration already has made clear its rationale for ending these efforts in its budget proposal, which was advancing through Congress on Tuesday.

""To end overreach from Washington and restore the rightful role of State oversight in education, the Budget proposes to eliminate the misnamed English Language Acquisition program which actually de-emphasizes English primacy by funding [nongovernmental organizations] and States to encourage bilingualism,"" the administration stated. ""The historically low reading scores for all students mean States and communities need to unite — not divide — classrooms using evidence-based literacy instruction materials to improve outcomes for all students.""

Advocates for English learners support ""evidence-based literacy instruction,"" but take issue with much of the rest of the administration's assertions, including the claim that programs to help students learning English are divisive.

""We want our students to gain proficiency in English so that they can access their education in English,"" said Martha Hernandez, executive director of Californians Together, a coalition of groups that advocates for English learners. ""And the majority of English learners are in English-only settings. These funds help students learn English.""

All children, under long-established federal law, are entitled to a free and appropriate education regardless of citizenship status.

Hernandez said there are about 5 million English learners speaking 100 different languages nationwide — about 1.1 million in California.

The proposed cut to migrant education is justified in budget documents as eliminating ""programs that work to the detriment of children’s academic success by encouraging movement from, rather than stability and consistency in, a single location. These programs have not been proven effective, are extremely costly, and encourage ineligible non-citizens to access [services], stripping resources from American students.""

The migrant program's effectiveness is open to reasonable debate, but the assertion that it encourages lack of stability is difficult to square with the reality on the ground. Los Angeles Unified uses this funding for academic support to provide stability and academic continuity for these students and their families.

Nebraska's program describes itself as providing ""educational services for migrant children to help reduce obstacles that result from repeated moves across school district boundaries.""

For students ages 3 to 5, the effort includes ""promoting interest in learning and filling educational gaps at home to prepare students for Kindergarten"" and also ""helping families find affordable preschool options.""

Other advocates weighed in on other affected funding, including money for academic support outside of the regular school day.

""After-school and summer learning programs are an American success story,"" said Jodi Grant, executive director of the group Afterschool Alliance. ""If these funds are not released very soon, we will quickly see more children and youth unsupervised and at risk, more academic failures, more hungry kids, more chronic absenteeism, higher dropout rates, more parents forced out of their jobs.""

The funding hold has become yet another area of conflict between the Trump administration and local educators, especially in blue states and urban areas. However, this funding pullback, if it stands, also will fall heavily on rural areas and red states.

In addition to facing a promised legal challenge, Trump's authority to withhold these funds will almost certainly face scrutiny from Congress.

Federal law prohibits the executive branch from refusing to distribute congressionally appropriated dollars, although the president can ask Congress for permission to hold back funds. Congress has 45 days after such a request is made to approve the president's action. Otherwise, the money must be spent as originally intended.

241,185,"Woody Guthrie’s ‘Deportee,’ an Ode to Deported Workers, Has Never Been More Relevant",http://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/woody-guthrie-deportee-song-immigrants-rare-recording-1235383582/,2025-07-14T12:18:33Z,Rolling Stone,GB,migrant,"For anyone who follows the news, the story will sound eerily familiar: migrant workers rounded up by immigration officials, put on a plane and transported to a deportation center and, ultimately, Mexico. The shocking twists, however, are the year it happened — 1948, in Fresno County, California — and the tragedy that ensued: The aircraft crashed, killing everyone onboard, including the 28 workers.

A month later, Woody Guthrie immortalized the horrific incident with a basic sketch for a song that, in the late Fifties, became “Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)” after Colorado folksinger Martin Hoffman set it to music. “Deportee” has since been covered by Pete Seeger, Bruce Springsteen, Dolly Parton, Joan Baez, Ani DiFranco, the late Guthrie pal and folksinger Cisco Houston, and Guthrie’s son Arlo, among many others. The Byrds’ version made Rolling Stone‘s list of the 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time.

But Guthrie’s own version has been lost to history, until now.

Unveiled today, “Deportee (Woody’s Home Tape)” is a newly unearthed and restored recording of Guthrie talk-singing his first version of the song. The historical document will be part of Woody at Home — Volumes 1 + 2 , a collection of previously unheard Guthrie recordings out Aug. 14 on Shamus Records.

In the tradition of so many topical and protest songs, “Deportee” was ripped directly from the headlines. Then living on Long Island, Guthrie heard the news about the plane crash either on the radio or in a newspaper. The New York Times reported that of those who died, some “entered the United states illegally” and others “stayed beyond duration of work contracts in California.” But as Guthrie noted of the coverage, only the members of the crew were identified. The workers were simply called “Mexican deportees,” as if they simply had no identifies; many were later buried in a mass grave in California.

The following month, Guthrie wrote the lyrics to “Deportee.” As his granddaughter Anna Canoni, president of Woody Guthrie Publications, said in a statement, “After reading the article, which only named the four Americans that perished, Woody wrote this song in — I don’t want to say anger or frustration, but perhaps in observation of the 28 Mexican nationals who were not named in the article, and moreover, an observation of how the U.S. treats foreigners.” Editor’s picks

In the home recording of the song, Guthrie is heard talking the lyrics over basic fingerpicking, without the more developed melody Hoffman later added. Making this version even more potent, Guthrie also adapts a first-person approach (“I don’t have a name and I ride this big airplane/And just call me one more deportee”) instead of the later third-person revise (“You won’t have your names when you ride the big airplane/All they will call you will be ‘deportees'”).

“Deportee (Plane Wreck at Los Gatos)” is probably the best-known of Guthrie’s songs that he didn’t fully record. At the time he made this tape, at the Guthrie family home in Brooklyn, he was coping with the early signs of what would later be diagnosed as Huntington’s disease. Guthrie would eventually be hospitalized in New Jersey, where a young Bob Dylan would meet him (a moment depicted in the recent Dylan biopic A Complete Unknown).

The new collection includes nearly two dozen unheard recordings, including a version of “This Land Is Your Land” with added verses, and home recordings of “Pastures of Plenty” and “Jesus Christ.” But for present-tense reasons, “Deportee” remains the most haunted and haunting of the tapes. As Canoni said, “My grandfather wrote, ‘A song ain’t nothing but a conversation you can have again and again.’ It keeps this conversation in the narrative. … And unfortunately, it needs to be had again and again and again.”",NewsAPI,-13.76,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/rolling-stone-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Mixed,26.24,"rolling stone, Rolling Stone Magazine, rollingstone.com  ",,https://ground.news/interest/rolling-stone,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/rolling-stone-media-bias,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Left,Unknown,Left,rollingstone.com,,rolling stone,33,UK,,,,
504,125,Ohio city whose Haitian migrants were disparaged by Trump braces to defend them against deportation,https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2025-08-02/ohio-city-whose-haitian-migrants-were-disparaged-by-trump-braces-to-defend-them-against-deportation,2025-08-03T00:08:27Z,Los Angeles Times,US,deportation,"People worship at the Mission Church of God of Vihote in Springfield, Ohio, on May 4, 2025.

An Ohio city whose Haitian migrants were disparaged by a Donald Trump falsehood last year as he pitched voters on his plans for an immigration crackdown is now bracing to defend the community against possible deportation.

A group of about 100 community members, clergy and Haitian leaders in Springfield gathered this week for several days of training sessions as they prepare to defend potential deportees and provide them refuge.

“We feel that this is something that our faith requires, that people of faith are typically law-abiding people — that’s who we want to be — but if there are laws that are unjust, if there are laws that don’t respect human dignity, we feel that our commitment to Christ requires that we put ourselves in places where we may face some of the same threats,” said Carl Ruby, senior pastor of Central Christian Church.

Ruby said the ultimate goal of the group is to persuade the Trump administration to reverse its decision to terminate legal protections for hundreds of thousands of Haitians in the U.S. under Temporary Protected Status, or TPS.

“One way of standing with the Haitians is getting out the message of how much value they bring to the city of Springfield,” he said. “It would be an absolute disaster if we lost 10,000 of our best workers overnight because their TPS ends and they can no longer work.”

In lieu of that, Ruby said, participants in the effort are learning how to help Haitians in other ways. That includes building relationships, accompanying migrants to appointments with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and providing their families with physical shelter.

A city in the crosshairs

Springfield found itself in an unwelcome spotlight last year after Trump amplified false rumors during a presidential debate that members of the mid-size city’s burgeoning Haitian population were abducting and eating cats and dogs. It was the type of inflammatory and anti-immigrant rhetoric he promoted throughout his campaign.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security announced in June that it would terminate TPS as soon as Sept. 2 for about 500,000 Haitians who are already in the United States, some of whom have lived here for more than a decade. The department said conditions in the island nation have improved adequately to allow their safe return. The United Nations contradicts that assertion, saying that the economic and humanitarian crisis in Haiti has only worsened with the Trump administration’s cuts in foreign aid.

The announcement came three months after the administration revoked legal protections for thousands of Haitians who arrived legally in the United States under a humanitarian parole program as part of a series of measures implemented to curb immigration. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned a federal judge’s order preventing the administration from revoking the parole program.

Last month, a federal judge in New York blocked the administration from accelerating an end to Haitians’ TPS protections, which the Biden administration had extended through at least Feb. 3, 2026, citing gang violence, political unrest, a major earthquake in 2021 and other factors.

Department of Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said at the time that the Trump administration would eventually prevail and that its predecessors treated TPS like a “de facto asylum program.” In the meantime, the government has set the expiration date back to early February.

TPS allows people already in the United States to stay and work legally if their homelands are deemed unsafe. Immigrants from 17 countries, including Haiti, Afghanistan, Sudan and Lebanon, were receiving those protections before Trump took office for his second term in January.

Residents ponder next steps

Charla Weiss, a founding member of Undivided, the group that hosted the Springfield workshop, said participants were asked the question of how far they would go to help Haitian residents avoid deportation.

“The question that I know was before me is, how far am I willing to go to support my passion about the unlawful detainment and deportation of Haitians, in particular here in Springfield?” she said.

Republican Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a longtime supporter of the Haitian community, was briefed by Springfield leaders during a visit to the city Friday. He told reporters that the state is bracing for the potential of mass layoffs in the region as a result of the TPS policy change, a negative for the workers and the companies that employ them.

“It’s not going to be good,” he said.

506,125,9th Circuit keeps freeze on Southern California ICE patrols,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-08-01/appeals-court-keeps-freeze-on-socal-ice-patrols,2025-08-02T08:31:08Z,Los Angeles Times,US,deportation,"Two U.S. Border Patrol agents return to their car after assisting ICE agents in a raid on Atlantic Boulevard in the city of Bell on June 20.

The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dealt a stinging blow to the Trump administration’s mass deportation project Friday night in a fiery opinion upholding a lower court’s block on “roving patrols” across much of Southern California.

“If, as Defendants suggest, they are not conducting stops that lack reasonable suspicion, they can hardly claim to be irreparably harmed by an injunction aimed at preventing a subset of stops not supported by reasonable suspicion,” the panel wrote.

The ruling leaves in place a temporary restraining order barring masked and heavily armed agents from snatching people off the streets of Southern California without first establishing reasonable suspicion that they are in the U.S. illegally.

Under the 4th Amendment, reasonable suspicion cannot be based solely on race, ethnicity, language, location or employment, either alone or in combination, U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong of Los Angeles wrote in her original order.

California Federal judge halts indiscriminate immigration stops in Los Angeles and beyond In a searing ruling, a federal judge in Los Angeles temporarily blocked the Trump administration from conducting indiscriminate sweeps in immigrant communities, saying they probably violate the 4th Amendment.

9th Circuit Judges Marsha S. Berzon, Jennifer Sung and Ronald M. Gould agreed.

“There is no predicate action that the individual plaintiffs would need to take, other than simply going about their lives, to potentially be subject to the challenged stops,” the opinion said.

Fourth Amendment injunctions are hard to win, experts say. Plaintiffs must show not only that they were hurt, but that they are likely to be hurt again in the same way in the future.

One way to meet that test in court is to show the injury is the product of a government policy. Throughout a hearing Monday, the appellate judges repeatedly probed that question, roughly doubling the administration’s time to respond in an effort to get an answer.

“After the district court injunction here, the secretary of Homeland Security said, ‘We are going to continue doing what we’re doing’ — so that’s not a policy?” Berzon asked.

“The policy is to follow the 4th Amendment and to require reasonable suspicion,” said Deputy Assistant Atty. Gen. Yaakov Roth.

California Chokeholds, bikers and ‘roving patrols’: Are Trump’s ICE tactics legal? The appellate court battle over whether ICE can resume ‘roving patrols’ across the Los Angeles area hangs on dueling legal precedents that involve the LAPD and the CHP.

Roth also rebuffed questions about a 3,000-arrests-per-day quota first touted by White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller in May.

In a memo to the panel on Wednesday, Roth clarified that “no such goal” had been established.

The court rejected that argument Friday, writing that “no official statement or express policy is required” to prove one exists.

“Agents have conducted many stops in the Los Angeles area within a matter of weeks ... some repeatedly in the same location,” the opinion said, making the likelihood of future stops “considerable.”

The ruling scolded the Department of Justice for “misreading” the restraining order it sought to block, and said it “mischaracterized” Judge Frimpong’s order. And it rejected the government’s central claim that its law enforcement mandate would be “chilled” by the district court’s order.

California Trump administration asks appeals court to lift restrictions on SoCal immigration raids After a federal judge in Los Angeles barred ‘roving patrols’ by immigration agents in seven California counties, the Trump administration asked the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to resume operations that lawyers for the state have argued are unconstitutional.

“Defendants have failed to establish that they will be ‘chilled’ from their enforcement efforts at all, let alone in a manner that constitutes the ‘irreparable injury’ required to support a stay pending appeal,” the panel wrote.

The case is still in its early phases, with hearings set for a preliminary injunction in September. But the “shock and awe” campaign of chaotic public arrests that first gripped Southern California on June 6 has all but ceased in the seven counties covered by Frimpong’s order: Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange, Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo.

“The underlying 4th Amendment law is not complicated,” said Mohammad Tajsar of the ACLU of Southern California — part of a coalition of civil rights groups and individual attorneys challenging cases of three immigrants and two U.S. citizens swept up in chaotic arrests. “Even a more conservative panel would have been concerned about what the government is doing.”

California Stephen Miller finally gets his revenge on L.A. In the long shadow of his policies, renewed attention is being paid to Miller’s upbringing in the famously liberal enclave once dubbed “the People’s Republic of Santa Monica.”

Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass, whose city was among a number of Southern California municipalities allowed to join the lawsuit this week, celebrated the news at a hastily arranged news conference late Friday night at Getty House, her official residence in Windsor Square.

The mayor strode out of the Tudor Revival-style home and toward the bank of waiting television cameras with a purposeful smile.

“This is a great day for Los Angeles,” she said, characterizing the court’s decision as a victory upholding the Constitution and affirming the rule of law.

Upholding the temporary restraining order “means that people cannot be snatched off the street by masked men like we had experienced for almost two months in the city,” Bass said, referencing the fact that the increasingly aggressive raids have often been carried out by masked agents who sometimes use unmarked vehicles.

Bass, whose late husband was Latino and whose late daughter, stepchildren and grandchildren are of Latino descent, has described the raids as deeply personal.

Speaking directly to the city’s immigrant community, Bass was sanguine about the possibility that the terror paralyzing local communities might begin to ebb.

President Donald Trump campaigned for president on the promise of mass deportations that targeted criminals -- and while ICE agents have arrested over 38,000 migrants with criminal convictions, new data shows a recent shift toward also arresting those who have not been accused of crimes.

In recent weeks, the Trump administration has arrested an increasing number of migrants with no criminal convictions, according to an ABC News analysis of Immigration and Customs Enforcement data.

The numbers, which were obtained through a public records lawsuit and released by the Deportation Data Project at the University of California Berkeley, give the first real glimpse of how Trump's immigration enforcement policy is playing out in the streets.

Over the first five months of the Trump administration, ICE has arrested over 95,000 individuals, according to data analyzed by ABC's owned television stations' data team.

At the start of the administration, ICE tended to target migrants with pending or criminal convictions. From Inauguration Day to May 4, 2025, 44% of those arrested had a criminal conviction, while 34% of those arrested had pending charges and 23% had no criminal history, according to the data.

But beginning May 25, the data appears to show there was a shift in enforcement -- with individuals with criminal convictions making up only 30% of those arrested. Those arrested with pending criminal charges accounted for 26% of the individuals arrested and 44% had no criminal history.

""It looks like there's been a shift from about Memorial Day this year up until now, to an increasing number of people who have been detained who have no criminal charges,"" said Austin Kocher, a professor at Syracuse University who reviewed the data.

""We hear a lot about the administration deporting the worst of the worst. And as far as we can tell from all available data up to this point, the data has not really supported that,"" Kocher said.

The data is largely divided into three groups of individuals: those who have criminal convictions, those with pending charges, and those who may be facing civil immigration charges, labeled as ""other immigration violators."" However, the data provides no indication of what kind of crimes the individuals may be accused or convicted of.

In Los Angeles, where ICE raids recently sparked large demonstrations, and in the New York City area, almost 60% of those arrested by ICE in the first ten days of June had no criminal convictions nor any pending criminal charges, according to the data.

Asked about the shift, Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told ABC News, ""We are not going to disclose law enforcement sensitive intelligence and methods. 70% of the arrests ICE made were of criminal illegal aliens.""

""We are continuing to go after the worst of the worst -- including gang members, pedophiles, and rapists,"" McLaughlin said. ""Under Secretary [Kristi] Noem, we are delivering on President Trump's and the American people's mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and make America safe.""

The majority of administration's migrant arrests have taken place in Texas, the state with the longest southern border. But the data also shows that enforcement has largely shifted away from apprehensions at the southern border to apprehensions in the interior of the country.

John Sandweg, the former acting director of ICE under President Barack Obama, told ABC News that the shift in enforcement is not a surprise, considering that illegal border crossings are down dramatically.

""For the last probably 15 years at least, the majority of ICE arrests, people booked into ICE custody or ICE apprehensions, were individuals apprehended at the border. But now, the administration is very sensitive to the numbers and has started putting ICE under pressure,"" Sandweg said, referring to Trump's call for more migrants to be deported.

""The problem is that you are now engaged in operations that are, frankly, more likely to find non-criminals than criminals,"" Sandweg said.

As ABC News previously reported, ICE's latest tactic has been arresting individuals at immigration courts. In most cases, when a deportation case is dismissed, it is a positive outcome for a migrant, attorneys told ABC News -- but according to immigration attorneys and advocates, immigration enforcement officers have been waiting in immigration court buildings and coordinating with DHS lawyers to arrest migrants promptly after their cases are dismissed, after which the migrants are placed into expedited removal proceedings without allowing them to fight their case.

""If there's anything that says this isn't about serious criminal enforcement, it's this wholesale dismissal of cases of the people who are showing up in immigration court,"" Sandweg said. ""I mean, you want to find the place where you're least likely to find dangerous criminals -- it's the people who show up for their immigration court hearings.""

Sandweg said these new types of enforcement, including courthouse arrests, are being made in an effort to achieve quotas set by the Trump administration.

""It's another way to just quickly make some arrests,"" Sandweg said.

The administration, meanwhile, says it's continuing its efforts to target accused criminals.

At a press conference on Friday, Attorney General Pam Bondi said federal authorities have arrested 2,711 alleged multinational gang members since Trump re-took office in January.

Trump again brings up the idea of deporting US citizens for crimes

President Donald Trump continued on Tuesday to float his idea, which some legal experts say is unconstitutional, to deport U.S. citizens who commit crimes.

Speaking to the press during a tour of a migrant detention center in the Florida Everglades, the president repeated claims that there are many immigrants who are now citizens and have been committing serious crimes.

""They're not new to our country. They're old to our country. Many of them were born in our country. I think we ought to get them the hell out of here, too, if you want to know the truth,"" he said. ""So maybe that will be the next job.""

The proposal came weeks after the Assistant Attorney General Brett Shumate -- a Trump appointee -- released a memo giving U.S. attorneys wide discretion to decide when to pursue the denaturalization process to ""advance the Administration's policy objectives.""

Some of the cases U.S. attorneys should pursue are those against individuals who have engaged in torture, war crimes, human trafficking and human rights violations, the memo says.

Legal experts have warned that Trump's proposals are unconstitutional claiming they violate the Eighth Amendment, which prohibits cruel and unusual punishment. The issue has not come before the courts yet.

Amanda Frost, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, told ABC News in April that the administration could try to target naturalized U.S. citizens, who can lose their immigration status if they've committed treason or falsified information during their naturalization process. However, she said those instances are rare.

""If someone’s a naturalized citizen, there could be an effort to denaturalize that person and deport them,"" Frost said. ""But then it would have to be that they committed some sort of fraud or error in their naturalization process. An unrelated crime could not be the basis for denaturalizing and deporting somebody.""

Trump acknowledged that he didn't know if deporting U.S. citizens who are convicted of crimes is legal.

""We'll have to find that out legally. I'm just saying if we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he added. ""I don't know if we do or not, we're looking at that right now.""

On Monday, the Trump administration notified states that it was withholding over $6 billion in previously approved federal education grants to schools. The announcement came a day before the July 1 deadline when those funds have traditionally been disbursed, and will likely impact school districts' plans for the fall.

In messages sent to state education officials, the U.S. Education Department said, ""Given the change in Administrations, the Department is reviewing the FY 2025 funding for the [Title I-C, II-A, III-A, IV-A, IV-B] grant program(s), and decisions have not yet been made concerning submissions and awards for this upcoming year.""

Sponsor Message

The message – which was shared with NPR by multiple sources, including The School Superintendents Association (AASA) – said grant money would not go out ""prior to completing that review.""

""This is definitely unprecedented to my knowledge,"" said Tara Thomas, government affairs manager at AASA.

""Districts really need to be able to rely on stable funding so that they're able to responsibly plan and budget, and actions like this are incredibly disruptive to school districts across the country.""

The Education Department has not yet replied to NPR's request for comment. In its message to state officials, the department also said it ""remains committed to ensuring taxpayer resources are spent in accordance with the President's priorities and the Department's statutory responsibilities.""

The grants under review fund a wide range of programs for schools, including migrant education, before- and after- school programs and services for English language learners.

The largest pot of grant money under review consists of roughly $2.2 billion for professional development for educators. Thomas says districts often use these funds to help pay for continued teacher training: ""At the end of the day, it's really just funding that makes teachers better at their jobs.""

It's not the first time the Trump administration has singled-out these programs: The administration's proposed FY 2026 budget eliminated all five grants now under review.

Sponsor Message

Two of the most important federal funding streams to public schools – Title I, which provides money to help districts that serve lower-income communities, and IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act), which provides money to help districts serve students with disabilities – have so far not been disrupted.

The 21st Century Community Learning Centers grant, which supports academic enrichment before- and after-school, is among the programs impacted by this week's announcement.

In one low-income Maine district, about 90 miles north of Portland, that grant helps fund a host of activities for students that educators say they couldn't otherwise afford, including outdoor adventure, sewing, chess, robotics, theater and cooking.

Dawn Fickett, who heads that program in school district MSAD 54, told NPR in the spring that the loss of these activities would be a blow for students in her area. She said this programming has led to impressive academic and other gains.

744,182,Trump's Alien Enemies Act Deportees Sent Back to Venezuela in Shameful Hostage Deal [Updated],https://reason.com/volokh/2025/07/18/trumps-alien-enemies-act-deportees-sent-back-to-venezuela-in-shameful-hostage-deal/,2025-07-18T21:48:56Z,Reason,US,illegal alien,"Some 252 Venezuelans illegally deported by the Trump Administration to imprisonment in El Salvador have now been sent back to Venezuela, in exchange for the release of ten Americans detained by the Venezuelan government. Trump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 to do the deportations.

This is a bad deal on many levels: It incentivizes further hostage-taking by Venezuela, it returns people who fled oppression back to the very same regime that oppressed them, and it certainly does not stop the administration's illegal and unjust invocation of the Alien Enemies Act.

I've said it before (e.g. - here and here), and I will say it again: hostage exchanges are a terrible idea, because they incentivize more hostage-taking. This deal is likely to incentivize Venezuela's socialist dictatorship to seize more Americans.

In one way, this deal is actually worse than the usual hostage exchange, where a democratic state sends captured terrorists or other operatives back to a terrorist group like Hamas or an authoritarian regime like Russia. Here, the men we are sending back are innocent people who fled an oppressive government, now being forcibly returned to it. Despite the administration's claims they were members of the Tren de Aragua drug gang, there is virtually no evidence this is so, and most have never been charged or convicted of any crime. Some are actually dissidents and regime opponents who face likely persecution upon their return. Even those not specifically targeted by the government will be consigned to what may well be lifelong and oppression and poverty under a brutal regime whose depredations have triggered the biggest refugee crisis in the history of the Western Hemisphere.

There was a time when conservative Republicans would have condemned efforts to return victims of socialism to their oppressors. No longer. But it remains unjust, nonetheless.

I suppose one can argue this is less bad than other hostage exchanges because, unlike, say, released Hamas terrorists or Russian covert operatives, it is highly unlikely the Venezuelans sent back under this deal will go on to harm the US. That is true precisely because the Trump Administration is lying about their supposed gang affiliations! It's a valid point. But not nearly enough to justify this sordid deal, or the illegal deportations leading up to it.

The deal also further reveals what has been clear for some time: the Trump administration lied in court when it claimed the Venezuelans deported to El Salvador were under Salvadoran control, and the US had no way to get them out. In reality, they were detained solely at US behest, and the Salvadorans released them as soon as the US asked. This has been clear for a long time, but is now even more so. Courts should take note, and reject similar administration assertions with respect to any other migrants deported to imprisonment in El Salvador, now or in the future.

The deal also will not put an end to Trump's illegal use of the AEA as a tool for peacetime deportation. Litigation over his further attempts to deport people under the Act is ongoing in multiple federal courts, and several have already ruled against them. For the reasons why these deportations illegal, see the Fifth Circuit amicus brief in W.M.M. v. Trump that I coauthored on behalf of the Brennan Center, the Cato Institute, legal scholar John Dehn, and myself. See also my earlier writings on the AEA here, here, here, and here.

To briefly summarize, the key point is that AEA may be invoked only in the event of a declared war or ""invasion"" or ""predatory incursion"" by a foreign nation or government against U.S. territory, and no such thing has happened here. In addition, Trump's AEA deportations to imprisonment in El Salvador are also blatant violations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.

UPDATE: I suppose I should emphasize I am not suggesting these Venezuelans should have been kept in imprisonment in El Salvador. Rather, they should never have been deported in the first place, and once illegally deported and imprisoned, should have been returned to the US. They also deserve compensation for their illegal imprisonment and resulting pain and suffering.

UPDATE #2: In a court filing today, the Trump Administration claims that Venezuelan dictator Nicolas Maduro has agreed to allow the Venezuelan migrants returned to his control under this deal to go back to the US if 1) a court orders it, 2) the US government is willing to ""facilitate"" their return, and 3) the person in question agrees. We will see if this is actually true or not, and if so whether the admnistration actually does the necessary ""facilitation."" Given the awful track records of these parties, there is reason to suspect that the administration, the Maduro regime, or both, may be lying again.",NewsAPI,4.58,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,36.27,"reason, Reason Magazine, reason.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/reason/,https://ground.news/interest/reason,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/reason-media-bias,RIGHT-CENTER (3.8),HIGH (1.7),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Magazine,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Right,High,Lean Right,Lean Right,Left,Unknown,Lean Right,reason.com,,reason,28,USA,Y,I,Reason,Y

A coalition of 24 states and the District of Columbia sued the Trump administration on Monday over the administration's decision to freeze more than $6 billion in federal education grants for K-12 schools and adult education. The move comes two weeks after the Trump administration first notified states that it was withholding the previously approved funds.

""With no rhyme or reason, the Trump Administration abruptly froze billions of dollars in education funding just weeks before the start of the school year,"" California Attorney General Rob Bonta said at a press conference Monday.

The U.S. Education Department, one of the defendants named in the lawsuit, has not yet responded to a request for comment.

Other states that joined the lawsuit include New York, Colorado, Massachusetts, Arizona, Kentucky and Pennsylvania.

Shortly after the funding freeze was initially announced, two Democratic lawmakers from Arizona, Sen. Mark Kelly and Rep. Greg Stanton, urged the administration to release the funds as soon as possible, noting their state's early start to the school year – in one district classes begin on July 16.

""This freeze is putting Arizona school districts in an impossible financial situation, as school districts have already adopted their annual budgets and signed contracts for the upcoming school year,"" the lawmakers wrote.

In addition, more than a hundred House Democrats wrote to the administration, asking that the funds be released immediately.

Some Republican lawmakers have also pushed back on the freeze.

Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told Education Week, ""I strongly oppose the administration's decision to pause the delivery of education formula grant funding to states and local school districts across the country ... The administration should release these funds without any further delay.""

The frozen funds include grants that pay for a wide range of programs for schools, including migrant education, before- and after- school programs and services for English language learners.

It's not the first time the Trump administration has singled-out these programs: The administration's proposed FY 2026 budget eliminated all the grants that are now frozen.

The Trump administration is seeking to deport Khalil over his role in the protests.



However, Judge Michael Farbiarz said it would be ""highly, highly unusual"" for the government to continue detaining a legal resident who was unlikely to flee and hadn't been accused of any violence.

(We’re all just waiting to be told we’re obligated to house National Guard troops sent by the administration to whatever state happens to be irritating him at the moment.)

Last month, Dhruv Merota of Wired reported the DHS was now adding DNA collected from migrant children to a criminal database run by the FBI (CODIS [Combined DNA Index System]) and accessible by hundreds of US law enforcement agencies. It was originally created to track dangerous and violent criminals.

Now, for reasons only explained by this administration’s blind hatred of non-white people, more than 133,000 migrant kids (ranging from teens to at least one four-year-old) are now populating a criminal database solely because their parents were undocumented migrants.

DNA is forever and this is a forever database. The government has no obligation to remove anyone from CODIS, which means migrant children are intermingling with dangerous criminals, only a search away from being presumed to be criminals by any law enforcement officer located pretty much anywhere in the United States.

The presumption is that anyone added has been, at the very least, served with criminal charges. But that’s not what happened here. That’s what Ron Wyden’s letter [PDF] makes clear, as he seeks answers he’ll probably never receive from Kristi Noem and/or the multiple immigration-focused agencies she now controls. (h/t Dell Cameron/Wired)

Lots of legitimate concerns are raised by Senator Wyden, starting with this apparent abuse of a criminal database to fill it with a bunch of non-criminal DNA samples.

The Trump administration appears to be broadly detaining individuals and collecting their DNA for permanent storage in CODIS. Reporting also suggests that 97% of noncitizens whose DNA was collected were detained under CBP’s civil authority, and not on any criminal charges.

Of that 97% of non-citizen non-criminals, more than 133,000 were minors, which is something that would normally under a normal regime make these people exempt from DNA collection efforts. Under Trump, however, anyone looking kinda like someone in need of deportation is getting added.

DHS policy states that individuals under the age of 14 are generally exempt from DNA collection, but DHS officials appear to have discretion to collect DNA in certain circumstances. The Executive Branch has not provided any justification for the permanent collection of the children’s DNA samples, or for the storage of children’s genetic information in a system originally designed to ensure public safety from violent criminals.

The end result is this: this DNA collected from migrant children will remain in CODIS forever, accessed every time a law enforcement officer seeks a DNA match from the system. While some people may think this is a victimless crime, the reality is that these kids are treated as criminal suspects during queries (because the database presumes anyone in it is a criminal). When false positives happen (and they will!), innocent children will be treated as criminal suspects despite having done nothing more than… well, being lied to by government agents.

[P]ublic reporting suggests that individuals were not aware of their DNA being collected by federal officials—many individuals thought their cheeks were swabbed by federal agents for the purposes of a COVID-19 test.

Yep, and that’s in addition to the family separation policies deployed by both Trump administrations. Immigration agents have — for several years now — made it a point to break up families, which makes it easier to get migrant kids to do what the government wants without being blocked by parents who might try to invoke their rights or otherwise discourage cooperation with (seemingly unlawful) actions by the US government.

In addition to all of the questions the public deserves answers to, Ron Wyden makes a point that will surely be lost on the fascists currently running the nation.

Governments exercising such broad discretion to involuntarily collect and retain DNA are repressive authoritarian regimes also engaging in gross human rights violations, such as genocide, ethnic cleansing, torture, and more. In fact, the U.S. Government has condemned the involuntary collection of DNA by the People’s Republic of China and has sanctioned entities engaged in this practice, yet this practice appears to be ongoing on our own soil.

Being compared to China with receipts attached is a low point for this nation. But that’s what Trump and his enablers seem to think will finally make America great: domestic surveillance, ethnic cleansing, the silencing of the media, the stripping of public funding from anything that seems remotely altruistic, and deploying the military to “police” cities and states whose the most powerful political figures oppose Trump and his actions. And every bit of info it can collect on the people living in the United States helps, even if its cheek swabs from kids who were told by federal officers they were being checked for possible infections.

toggle caption Mark Wilson/Getty Images

The Department of Homeland Security is preparing to use military bases in New Jersey and Indiana to detain immigrants who entered the country illegally, as well as to increase the number of immigrants detained at the U.S. Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, according to correspondence between DHS and the Pentagon obtained by NPR.

According to the letter, dated July 15, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth approved the moves, which were requested by DHS the previous month.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement, which is part of DHS, had sought immediate access to Camp Atterbury, a National Guard base in Indiana, and Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, a base in New Jersey, from the Defense Department.

ICE is also seeking to detain more immigrants without legal status at Guantánamo Bay prior to their final removal from the United States.

""DoD approves this support through September 30, 2025, subject to ICE maintaining a 24/7 oversight presence at each site to maintain custody and provide overall supervision of each site,"" stated the letter from Executive Secretary Anthony Fuscellaro to DHS acting Executive Secretary Andrew Whitaker. ICE staff and contractors will be responsible for all care and handling of the migrants, including meals, medical screening, transportation and medical services, according to the correspondence obtained by NPR.

Neither DHS nor the Defense Department has yet responded to questions about the letter.

On his first day in office, President Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, enabling DHS to gain access to DOD's military resources. During congressional testimony, Todd Lyons, ICE's acting director, told lawmakers he did not expect DHS to repay the Pentagon for their costs.

The approval letter notes that DHS will pay DOD for any costs associated with migrant detention at McGuire Field, the Air Force base in New Jersey.

The request for the use of additional military bases, and expansion at Guantánamo, comes as the Trump administration has pushed to arrest and detain more people in the country without legal status. DHS has nearly 57,000 people in immigration detention, though it only has about 41,000 beds. The department has sought out contracts with the Federal Bureau of Prisons, local jurisdictions, and the use of military bases to detain migrants.

By June, Guantánamo was holding about 500 migrants, though until now the base could only accommodate about 200.

In the letter to lawmakers obtained by NPR, Hegseth said that the use of the bases in Indiana and New Jersey for immigration detention ""will not negatively affect military training, operations, readiness, or other military requirements, including National Guard and Reserve readiness.""

Camp Atterbury in Indiana will assist with removal operations out of the Chicago area; McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey will support Newark. Guantánamo Bay is designated to help with detentions and removals from Miami.

The plan laid out by DHS calls for space for up to 1,000 people at the Indiana and New Jersey bases and to approximately double the capacity at Guantánamo to 400 people.

DOD rejected a request from DHS for air transportation assistance until it got more details.

In May, DHS asked for 20,000 National Guard members to assist ICE in its operations ranging from ""night raids"" and ""rural interdictions"" to guard duty at detention facilities. The Pentagon has already approved some 700 guard members to assist in Florida, Louisiana and Texas.

A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that hundreds more National Guard troops are expected to be called up to assist operations in Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia.

The Democratic congressional delegation in a statement condemned the terms of the use of the New Jersey base.

""This is an inappropriate use of our national defense system and military resources,"" they said in the statement. ""Using our country's military to detain and hold undocumented immigrants jeopardizes military preparedness and paves the way for ICE immigration raids in every New Jersey community. We have the greatest military in the world and using it as a domestic political tool is unacceptable and shameful.""

In addition to using the military, the Trump administration is expected to be able to scale up its detention capacity due to an influx of funding from Congress. The recent tax and spending bill set aside $45 billion for immigration detention centers and $30 billion for more ICE personnel, transportation costs and to maintain existing ICE facilities.

from the party-of-law-and-order dept

Quite obviously, the Trump Administration was never going to respect the law when it came to its mass deportation plans. That much became immediately clear as ICE engaged in raid after raid of neighborhoods and businesses, searching for literally any migrant, rather than just those suspected of or convicted for violent crimes.

As soon as the planes loaded with detainees began landing in countries most of those on board weren’t from, the efficient cruelty of Trump’s anti-migrant actions was exposed. Multiple legal challenges were filed, most of them seeking little more than forcing the government to respect due process rights. As the phrase says, they’re rights, not privileges that can be unilaterally revoked just because the current administration has a hate-on for non-whites.

The administration that has always pretended to be ultra-concerned about “law and order” went rogue. Planes were put in the air after courts ordered them to remain on the ground. People exiled to foreign prisons remained caged while the Trump DOJ dodged court orders and refused to honestly answer questions about why it continued to refuse to right some of its wrongs.

Not that we needed more evidence of this administration’s hatred for the laws that stand in the way of its cruelest urges, but here’s more anyway. Erez Ruveni, a former DOJ lawyer, has filed a whistleblower complaint about the DOJ’s actions since Trump’s return to office. Via the New York Times, here’s why Ruveni is no longer employed by the DOJ:

Mr. Reuveni was a career lawyer at the department for nearly 15 years until April, when he expressed concern in federal court that the administration had mistakenly deported a migrant to a megaprison in El Salvador. Mr. Reuveni was put on administrative leave a day later and ultimately fired.

That public embarrassment of the DOJ, via an open admission that an error was made, was enough to provoke Trump’s DOJ to fire one of its few remaining honest lawyers. Those still working for the DOJ have sold their soul for a handful of future paychecks. Either that or they never had a soul to sell, like senior DOJ official Emil Bove, whose anti-law and order statements are included in Ruveni’s whistleblower report.

Bove told attendees of the March 14 meeting that President Donald Trump would soon be invoking the Alien Enemies Act and that deportations would be carried out that weekend. […] “Bove then made a remark concerning the possibility that a court order would enjoin those removals before they could be effectuated. Bove stated that DOJ would need to consider telling the courts ‘f— you’ and ignore any such court order,” according to the letter.

Incredibly, Ruveni’s letter notes that he thought Bove’s heated comments would be blown off and things would return to their normal, lawful way — something that’s sort of expected at the Department of Justice. Instead, that was apparently the tipping point, not only in terms of his job, but for the DOJ as a whole.

Here’s how things went for Ruveni during the last few weeks of his DOJ career, as recounted in the complaint [PDF] released by his legal reps at the Government Accountability Project:

White House officials have publicly disparaged Mr. Reuveni to justify their refusal to comply with the Constitution and with court orders. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller falsely stated “The only mistake that was made is a lawyer put an incorrect line in a legal filing,” and labeled Mr. Reuveni a “saboteur, a Democrat.” Referring to Mr. Reuveni, President Trump stated, “Well, the lawyer that said it was a mistake was here a long time, was not appointed by us—should not have said that should not have said that.” What has not been reported to date are Mr. Reuveni’s attempts over the course of three weeks and affecting three separate cases to secure the government’s compliance with court orders and his resistance to the internal efforts of DOJ and White House leadership to defy them through lack of candor, deliberate delay, and disinformation. Discouraging clients from engaging in illegal conduct is an important part of the role of a lawyer. Mr. Reuveni tried to do so and was thwarted, threatened, fired, and publicly disparaged for both doing his job and telling the truth to the court.

Of course, the DOJ and the administration have no real response to these accusations. Instead, the White House has chosen to ignore everything said in the letter and act like it works for Emil Bove, rather than the other way around:

“Emil Bove is an incredibly talented legal mind and a staunch defender of the U.S. Constitution who will make an excellent circuit court judge,” the statement by White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said.

Well, at best, only part of this statement is true. I can only speculate about the Bove’s “talented mind,” but it’s inherently clear he doesn’t give a fuck about the Constitution. That much can easily be seen by his support of Trump’s Alien Enemies Act abuses and the migrant flights he ensured wouldn’t be interrupted by issued court orders. He’s not serving the public. He’s nothing more than another opportunist who has sworn his fealty to a man who sincerely believes the Oval Office is a throne room.

The main category winner will win a €40,000 ($46,688) cash prize and nearly $12,000 worth of Leica camera equipment, while the winner of the newcomer award will earn a €10,000 ($11,681) prize and a Leica Q3.

Each of the dozen photographers shortlisted for the award has created a striking, emotionally powerful photo series that pushes the boundaries of what photography is and what its potential impact can be.

Leica has not separated its 12-photographer shortlist into two distinct categories; therefore, each candidate is presented in alphabetical order below, along with a brief description of their selected photo series.

Lynsey Addario — ‘Mom, I Want to Live’

American photographer Lynsey Addario’s extremely powerful series, “Mom, I Want to Live,” focuses on a young Ukrainian girl who was diagnosed with a rare form of eye cancer in 2020 at just two years old. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine prevented her from accessing the essential treatment that she needed, forcing the young girl and her family to face life-threatening pediatric cancer and the horrors of war simultaneously. Addario’s emotional, intimate series recently won first place in the NPPA’s Best of Photojournalism awards.

Arlette Bashizi — ‘Beyond Numbers’

Arlette Bashizi’s series, “Beyond Numbers,” investigates the impact of ongoing conflict in her home country, the Democratic Republic of Congo. The series turns the lens toward the effects of war on regular people — over six million Congolese people have had to flee their homes since fighting broke out. Bashizi’s series examines individuals who might have otherwise been overlooked in a sea of statistics. Her neighbors are not just numbers, they are people who deserve to be seen as they face incredible challenges.

Alejandro Cegarra — ‘The Two Walls’

Mexico was once a safe place for asylum seekers. However, in recent years, the government has taken on more of the anti-immigration sentiment of its neighbor to the north, the U.S.. In his black-and-white photo series, “The Two Walls,” Venezuelan-born, Mexican-raised photographer Alejandro Cegarra documents the struggles of people facing the growing changes along the Mexican border.

Serghei Duve — ‘Bright Memory’

German photographer Serghei Duve’s series “Bright Memory” reflects the Russian expression of the same term, which explores how everyday life is shaped by nostalgia and social divisions. Duve, who was born in Moldova, uses his camera to explore his family’s lasting connection to the territory of Transnistria. This almost entirely unrecognized region declared its independence from Moldova in 1990 but receives international support exclusively from Russia.

Gideon Mendel — ‘Deluge’

South African photographer Gideon Mendel’s series, “Deluge,” offers a poignant perspective on the global climate crisis. Mendel has photographed people from all walks of life across 13 countries since 2007, capturing how they and their homes have been impacted by climate change. Environmental destruction affects everyone, albeit in different ways depending on their socioeconomic status.

Stanislav Ostrous — ‘Civilians. The Gray Zone’

Ukrainian photographer Stanislav Ostrous’ series, “Civilians. The Gray Zone,” delivers a monochromatic look at how Ukrainians in Donetsk, Kherson, and Kharkiv are enduring the ongoing conflict. Donetsk in particular has been living under Russian threat for over a decade, when Russia annexed Crimea and began its war in Donbass. Ostrous focuses on the harsh realities of war and how civilian victims grapple with their devastating circumstances.

Xiangjie Peng — ‘The Rise of Queer Underground Party Culture in China’

Veteran Chinese photographer Xingjie Peng has been photographing the queer community across numerous Chinese cities since 2017. His series, “The Rise of Queer Underground Party Culture in China,” features portraits that document queer people and the places where they can be themselves in China. The photos document how people can be embraced and find a community in a country that still has official policies that restrict their authentic expression.

Ivor Prickett — ‘War on the Nile – Fragmented Sudan’

Irish photographer Ivor Prickett traveled to Sudan last year on behalf of The New York Times, tasked with capturing the horrific civil war in Sudan that has received little international attention. The war, which has been ongoing for two years, has displaced over 11 million people, and around 150,000 people have already been killed. It is one of the world’s most horrific humanitarian crises, and Prickett’s powerful photos capture the extent of the tragedy and desperation.

Frederik Rüegger — ‘I Am a Stranger in This Country’

A mostly unrecognized consequence of Brexit in the United Kingdom has been the damage done to the Irish Travellers community, who can no longer freely and easily move throughout the European Union. Frederik Rüegger’s series, “I Am a Stranger in This Country,” examines this community as it confronts new and evolving threats to its way of life. The ethnocultural group finds fewer safe spaces in the world today amid growing nationalistic tendencies and misinformation. Rüegger’s series focuses predominantly on scenes in horse markets, one of the few places where Travellers can openly exist and celebrate their unique culture.

Anastasia Taylor-Lind — ‘5km from the Frontline’

English photographer Anastasia Taylor-Lind has spent the past decade working alongside journalist Alisa Sopova to document the war in Ukraine, especially the Donbass region, where the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war began in 2014. The region has remained exceptionally violent and damaged as Russia’s invasion spread to other parts of Ukraine in recent years. The series examines how people have managed to survive under constant threat for years and how their lives have been shaped by prolonged conflict.

Jodi Windvogel — ‘Life Under Occupation – Cissie Gool House’

The Cissie Gool House in Cape Town, South Africa, was once a hospital. However, in 2017, it was occupied by a social movement, Reclaim the City. The movement, focused on providing affordable housing for marginalized people in Cape Town, turned the Cissie Gool House into a refuge for more than 2,000 people before a forced eviction last year. Jodi Windvogel’s series, “Life Under Occupation — Cissie Gool House,” looks at what happened, its deep roots in apartheid, and the people who have been impacted by a lack of secure housing.

Zhan Youbing — ‘Migrant Workers in China’s Assembly Line’

Chinese photographer Zhan Youbing has documented China’s migrant workers for over three decades. Today, there are more than 300 million migrant workers in China, who serve as a vital backbone for the country’s economic growth. Many of them leave rural areas in search of new and better opportunities in China’s bustling urban centers. “Migrant Workers in China’s Assembly Line” looks at people in Dogguan, a megacity where over 70% of its people are migrant workers. Youbing, a self-taught photographer, focuses on the daily routines of migrant workers in the area.

Leica Oskar Barnack Award 2025

“This year’s Leica Oskar Barnack Award jury reached a decision on the back of keen attention and a deep appreciation for photography’s social impact,” says Leica’s Karin Rehn-Kaufmann, the Art Director and Chief Representative for Leica Galleries International.

The final winners will be revealed on October 9, 2025, at the Ernst Leitz Museum. Following the showcase event in Wetzlar, Germany, the 2025 LOBA exhibition will travel to all Leica Galleries worldwide, of which there are more than 20.

A panel of judges at the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, one of the country's more conservative courts, heard arguments Monday over whether the Trump administration can invoke the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelan migrants it considers to be part of the Tren de Aragua criminal gang.

""This has been invoked three times only in major, major wars,"" argued ACLU attorney Lee Gelernt regarding the Alien Enemies Act, an 18th century wartime authority used to remove noncitizens with little-to-no due process. ""The government is now suggesting you can invoke it with a gang.""

The Trump administration touched off a legal battle in March when it invoked the Alien Enemies Act to deport two planeloads of alleged migrant gang members to the CECOT mega-prison in El Salvador by arguing that Tren de Aragua is a ""hybrid criminal state"" that is invading the United States.

In the multiple lawsuits the ACLU has helped bring against Trump's use of the AEA, the group has argued that the administration failed to prove that the presence of Tren de Aragua members amounts to a ""predatory incursion"" or a declared war as the text of the AEA outlines.

""This was solely about war and serious military conflict at a size where we would respond with our military, and no one's suggesting that the military has or would respond here,"" Gelernt argued during Monday's hearing.

The judges, however, seemed most concerned about whether or not they had the power to rule against a president's invocation of the act.

""Can you give me a Supreme Court case where the Supreme Court has said you can, as a federal court, countermand the president of the United States in his determination that we're in an armed conflict?"" one of the judges asked.

Gelernt replied that he could not point to a specific case, but argued that if the court were to declare that the AEA requires a military conflict, ""it would have to be able to take action to say, 'Well, does the proclamation on its face set forth a military conflict?'""

""The government itself is not claiming there's a military conflict,"" he said.

Deputy Assistant Attorney General Drew Ensign argued that the court did not have the power to second guess the president's authority to invoke the act.

Ensign also claimed that Tren de Aragua had taken over ""entire apartment buildings in which they exercise control"" in areas across the country, and that the FBI had reason to believe that the gang would carry out assassinations in the United States.

""The FBI has assessed that it's likely the TdA will try to carry out targeted assassinations of the Maduro regime in the next six to 18 months, as indeed, they have done in Chile -- they kidnapped and murdered a former Venezuelan army colonel who was a critic of the Maduro regime and had asylum in Chile,"" said Ensign.

""So we think all of that evidence clearly supports the president's determination that an invasion and predatory incursion has occurred,"" Ensign said.",NewsAPI,-3.01,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/abc-news-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.71,"abc news, ABC News, abcnews.com, ABC, abcnews  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/,https://ground.news/interest/abc-news_409efb,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.1),USA,,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,The Walt Disney Company,1945,-1.42,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,abcnews.go.com,,abc news,22,USA,Y,G,ABC News,

Amid internal legal dispute, Trump's administration continues with its controversial and fast-paced deportation policy to El Salvador, as part of a partnership with President Bukele.

Recent court filings suggest the Trump administration ""misled federal judges, Congress, and the American people"" about a deal between the U.S. and El Salvador to detain over 200 Venezuelan migrants at the notorious mega-prison known as CECOT, four Democratic ranking members of House committees said in a letter.

The letter, reviewed by ABC News, was sent Thursday to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and calls on officials to turn over any and all agreements between the U.S. and El Salvador, which have not been made public.

The letter cites court filings that appear to contradict the administration’s contention that migrants sent to the prison are solely under the jurisdiction of the government of El Salvador.

According to those filings, submitted July 7 in a case challenging the removal of Venezuelan migrants from the U.S., the government of El Salvador told a United Nations working group that the men in CECOT deported from the U.S. remain the “legal responsibility” of the United States.

""In this context, the jurisdiction and legal responsibility for these persons lie exclusively with the competent foreign authorities, by virtue of international agreements signed and in accordance with the principles of sovereignty and international cooperation in criminal matters,"" El Salvador officials said in a report to the U.N.

In their letter, the ranking members said the filing “indicates that the Department of Justice has misled federal courts in assertions regarding the agreement with El Salvador.”

ABC News has reached out to DHS and the State Department for comment on the letter.

The Trump administration has insisted for months that it is unable to return any of the migrants sent to CECOT because they're under El Salvador's authority.

In March, the Trump administration invoked the Alien Enemies Act, a wartime authority, to deport two planeloads of alleged Venezuelan gang members to El Salvador as part of a $6 million deal the administration struck with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele to house migrant detainees as part of Trump's immigration crackdown.

The Trump administration argued that the men who were deported are members of Tren de Aragua which the government has deemed a foreign terrorist organization and a “hybrid criminal state” that is invading the country.

However, one ICE official said in a sworn declaration submitted in federal court that many of the noncitizens who were deported did not have criminal records in the United States because “they have only been in the United States for a short period of time.”

The Democrats' letter also highlighted reporting by The New York Times that said the deal between the U.S. and Bukele, also included an agreement to return some top leaders of the MS-13 gang who allegedly had knowledge of a ""corrupt bargain"" between Bukele and the gang ""that has played a significant role in the decrease in gang violence in El Salvador.” ABC News has not independently confirmed that reporting.

In addition to the U.S.-El Salvador agreement, the lawmakers are asking the Trump administration to provide information about how it screens migrants with valid asylum claims or withholding of removal orders, and Convention Against Torture protection claims before they’re removed from the country.

“Congress has the right and the obligation to conduct oversight over the executive branch and determine what deals our government has struck with a foreign dictator to imprison individuals seized in the United States in an effort to place them beyond the reaches of our courts,” they wrote.

258,8,What’s in the one-in-one-out migrant deal between the UK and France?,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/10/whats-in-the-one-in-one-out-migrant-deal-between-the-uk-and-france,2025-07-10T13:02:16Z,Al Jazeera English,GB,migrant,"The United Kingdom and France have reached a new agreement aimed at preventing tens of thousands of migrants from crossing the English Channel from France in small boats, following talks on Thursday.

French President Emmanuel Macron arrived in London on Tuesday for a three-day visit, marking the first state visit by a European leader since Britain’s exit from the European Union.

Here is all we know about the “one-in-one-out” migrant deal which was discussed during a bilateral summit between Macron and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer in London.

What’s in the deal Macron and Starmer discussed?

The deal is aimed at deterring migrants from making dangerous trips across the English Channel from France to the UK in small boats. This year so far, more than 20,000 people have undertaken this journey.

At the start of the summit with Macron on Thursday, Starmer said the two must “apply our collective strength and leadership” to the challenges of undocumented migration.

“We all agree that the situation in the Channel cannot go on as it is so we’re bringing new tactics into play and a new intent to tackle illegal migration and break the business model of the criminal gangs.”

Many migrants without visas or permits departing France by sea attempt to cross to the UK in small, inflatable boats. They frequently pay large sums of money to gangs who arrange the boats in northern France. Journeys can be incredibly dangerous and people have died making the crossing.

Under a new agreement, France will agree to take back asylum seekers who have crossed over to the UK and who cannot prove a family connection to the UK. For each migrant France takes back, the UK will grant asylum to one migrant from France who can prove a family connection to the UK.

During the initial stages of the agreement, details of which were reported by French newspaper Le Monde, the UK will initially send about 50 migrants to France per week as part of a “pilot” scheme. Le Monde also reported that the UK would only be able to return 2,600 migrants in a single year.

The UK press quoted a government source on Thursday saying that plans would be scaled up if the initial pilot scheme is successful.

Who is to blame for the influx of people by boat to the UK?

Both France and the UK have laid the blame on each other.

One of France’s main criticisms of the UK is that it attracts migrants without visas because UK laws are too lenient or not adequately enforced. In his speech to Parliament during his state visit on Tuesday, Macron said that one-third of all migrants arriving in France intend to move on to the UK.

During negotiations with the UK 18 months ago when he was interior minister, Gerald Darmanin, France’s current justice minister, said: “Britain must do something to make itself less attractive and change the rules of their labour market because you can work without papers in the UK,” he said.

The UK disputes this, saying people are drawn to it because of family or diaspora ties, as well as many being able to speak English. Instead, some politicians in the UK have blamed France for not policing its northern shores enough. However, Starmer is also expected to unveil new plans to crack down harder on illegal work in the UK.

France, in turn, says it is making huge efforts to deter migrant departures from northern beaches and to take action against people-smuggling gangs.

Why is this agreement being made now?

The deal was reached because of the rising number of unauthorised migrants arriving from France to the UK, Peter Walsh, a senior researcher at the Migration Observatory at Oxford University, told Al Jazeera.

Just one year since Starmer’s Labour party won a landslide election, the prime minister’s popularity has tanked in the UK – in large part because of the failure to stop undocumented migration – while support for the far-right, anti-migration Reform UK party has soared.

In particular, Reform’s manifesto pledges to clamp down on migrants coming to the UK in small boats. It states: “Illegal migrants who come to the UK will be detained and deported. And if needed, migrants in small boats will be picked up and taken back to France.”

The Conservative Party, which was in power before Starmer won last year’s general election, pledged to impose a binding cap for legal migration and to deport asylum seekers who arrive by irregular means to Rwanda for processing and potential resettlement. Labour scrapped this plan as soon as it came to power.

As of July 7, immigration and asylum stand as the most significant issue in the UK, at 51 percent, according to polling by YouGov.

According to commentary in UK media, Starmer’s meeting with Macron also holds symbolic significance, as it allows the British PM to show that he has been able to maintain a good relationship with his main European partners since he negotiated a “reset” trade deal with the EU in May.

How many people cross the English Channel in small boats each year?

This year, 21,117 people crossed the English Channel from France to the UK in small boats as of July 6, according to UK government data. This was a 56 percent increase in the number of people crossing in small boats during the same period in 2024.

In the whole of 2024, nearly 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats, bringing the weekly average to about 700 arrivals.

In the past year, 73 people have died trying to cross the English Channel, the highest number recorded in one year so far, according to data by the International Organization for Migration (IOM), an intergovernmental organisation within the United Nations.

Small boat arrivals made up one-third of all asylum applications in 2024, according to an analysis by the Migration Observatory based on statistics from the UK Home Office.

Why do so many people make this risky crossing?

Walsh told Al Jazeera that people take the risk of crossing the Channel for a wide range of reasons. “One is the presence of family members, friends, and members of their community already in the UK,” he said.

He explained that because the UK is no longer part of the EU following Brexit, it does not have access to the bloc’s asylum fingerprint database any more. Therefore, British authorities cannot know if people who arrive in small boats have already claimed asylum in an EU country.

“If it did, the UK would be able to dismiss the claims,” he said. “The UK is also no longer a part of the Dublin system that would allow for such asylum claimants to be returned to the EU. Migrants understand this, so view reaching the UK as giving them another chance at securing residence in the UK.”

The Dublin regulation – the framework for the EU’s rules on asylum seekers – establishes the criteria that determine which EU member state is responsible for examining asylum applications submitted by someone who is originally from a third country.

Between 2018 and 2024, 68 percent of asylum applications from migrants who arrived in small boats were granted in the UK. This was higher than the grant rate for asylum applications generally, which was 57 percent for the same duration. This may be another reason people are attracted to the UK, experts say.

What steps have France and the UK taken to stop boats crossing the English Channel?

In March 2023, the UK, under former Conservative PM Rishi Sunak, signed a three-year deal with France, under which the UK agreed to pay France 480 million pounds ($650m) to tighten its border patrols and surveillance.

Under this deal, France agreed to deploy 500 officers and provide a new detention centre in France, which would be operational by the end of 2026. France also agreed to increase funding for stricter enforcement, without specifying the amount of money.

Separately, in June this year, France agreed to come up with a plan to intercept small boats heading to the UK, for the first time, expanding its navy with six patrol boats that will rescue migrants but also intercept them from heading to the UK.

Paris has agreed to do this for boats which are within 300 metres (1,000ft) from the French shore, and has asked the UK for extra funding to fund the police and equipment to enforce these interceptions, according to UK media.

French police have recently taken to damaging the small boats, slashing their rubber frames with knives. The French Interior Ministry told The Associated Press that the police had not been ordered to do this, however.

What are the criticisms of the new deal?

Since an average of 700 migrants enter the UK by small boat each week, if the UK government sends an average of 50 people back to France per week, that would amount to just one in 14 being returned.

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp of the opposition Conservative Party told The Times newspaper: “This deal will mean that 94 percent of illegal migrants crossing the Channel will get to stay. That is pathetic and will not deter anyone. By contrast, the Rwanda deterrent would have seen 100 percent of illegal migrants removed and that would have worked to deter people crossing the Channel. Keir Starmer’s failure continues.”

The plan could potentially face a legal challenge under the UN Refugee Convention, which mandates asylum seekers’ rights to request protection.

French officials are also critical of the deal, cautious it could result in France becoming a “return hub” for migrants that the UK refuses to accept. “We are putting ourselves into the hands of the British without minimal reciprocal elements,” an unnamed French official involved in the talks told Le Monde.

The policy could also provide ammunition against Macron for his right-wing political critics, who may question why he has agreed to take back migrants wanting to live in Britain.

The UK is not subject to the EU’s Dublin regulations, while France is. This makes the status of migrants returning from Britain to France unclear, causing concern among other European nations, who are upset with France for bilaterally negotiating the deal without consulting the EU.

“Why should other Europeans be obliged to take these returns under EU, Dublin rules when they result from French obligation under a bilateral deal with the UK, a non-EU member, that France negotiated without asking us?” The Times quoted an unnamed EU diplomat as saying on Thursday.

A deal is also opposed by the southern European countries of Cyprus, Greece, Italy, Malta and Spain, who have been receiving unauthorised migrants at an increasing rate, the Financial Times reported. These countries are concerned that if migrants are sent back to France from the UK, they may try to enter southern Europe from France instead.

As the 2000s came to a close, the immigrant population multiplied by more than fivefold in Spain, Italy and Greece, according to a 2016 research article written by scholars from the University of Liege in Belgium.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said on Wednesday during Prime Minister’s Questions in Parliament that the UK must refuse to accept “undocumented males” coming in small boats as part of a deal with France. Farage said Starmer should not bow to an “increasingly arrogant, anti-Brexit French president”. Starmer responded, saying Farage’s approach is to “break everything and claim that’s how you fix things”.

Weighing the viability of the agreement between Paris and London, Walsh said: “A returns deal may have an impact if it affects enough people. We don’t know how many people could plausibly be returned to France under this deal, but there’s a risk that if an insufficiently low share of individuals are returned, then people wishing to reach the UK by small boat may see the risk of return as another risk worth taking – alongside the much greater risk of getting in a small boat.”",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

The tyrant, of course, was King George III, the target of the Declaration of Independence. We take it for granted now, but the declaration was an enormous political innovation — in it, the country that became the United States of America laid claim to certain “unalienable” rights, rights that took precedence over any king or crown.

To protect those rights, our founders declared that the People were allowed to “alter” or “abolish” the government — in this case, British rule over the American colonies.

The idea that “the People” have “unalienable rights” became so standard that it slipped into cliche

The point of the famous preamble to the Declaration — “We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness” — is that the government should exist to protect our rights, a radical proposition in an era when governments mostly existed on the basis that one guy was descended from another guy. Over time, the idea that “the People” have “unalienable rights” became so standard that it slipped into cliche, the stuff of car commercials. But this was not a throwaway line. These rights are repeated throughout the founding documents of the United States. Life and liberty aren’t just there for decoration — they are essential to the spec. They are the reason why the entire American system has been designed the way it has.

The declaration pronounces these rights to be so important that it’s worth overthrowing a government over them. But one should not undertake revolution against a tyrannical government lightly, the declaration says, going on to provide a massive litany of complaints as justification. In modern times, the full list was considered to be the boring part of this document, lacking the vim and vigor of “we hold these truths to be self-evident” and other such bars from the preamble. But this year, it’s become a… bracing read.

Listed among the reasons to boot the British monarch are:

From the beginning, this has all been profoundly un-American

From the beginning, this has all been profoundly un-American, and it wasn’t surprising when the Trump administration ran into some legal problems. A district court judge issued an injunction against the Department of Homeland Security, requiring it to add a fairly basic form of due process to its deportation machine. Detainees set to be deported must be told where they are going, so they can have the chance to explain that being sent to that specific country may result in their torture or death. “This small modicum of process is mandated by the Constitution of the United States,” the judge wrote.

“Small” is too fucking right; giving someone the opportunity to pipe up before being shipped off to a place that might kill them is not exactly a radical affirmation of human rights. But this is where we are as a country: the right-wing justices of the Supreme Court stayed the injunction. So the DHS can now go right back to shipping people off to CECOT — or somewhere even worse — without telling them where they are going or hearing out why they should not go.

The pause on the lower court’s injunction happened via what is known as “the shadow docket.” By temporarily blocking or declining to block a lower court’s order, SCOTUS makes a decision without officially making a decision, and can do so without bothering to explain its reasoning.

Even though there is no written opinion for the ruling, there is a dissent from the three liberal justices. “The Government has made clear in word and deed that it feels itself unconstrained by law, free to deport anyone anywhere without notice or an opportunity to be heard,” wrote Justice Sonia Sotomayor. She concluded that the majority is “rewarding lawlessness.” When the lady is right, she’s right.

Trump has mostly issued executive order after executive order to enact his agenda, because Congress doesn’t have the votes to pass such unpopular laws. He’s also used executive orders to defang the laws Congress has passed, like the TikTok ban, which has now led directly to Congress passing unpopular laws on the promise that Trump will simply override the provisions he doesn’t like. Congress is meant to be the most powerful part of the federal government, but the Republican Congress under Trump has receded into a group of weak-willed simpletons, content to sell out their constituents for little more than signed merch.

Not content with usurping congressional authority, Trump’s executive orders have barged straight into reinterpreting and rewriting the Constitution itself — for example, by purporting to end birthright citizenship, a cornerstone of the US as we know it.

In theory, there is one last important check on a power-mad president

Now, in theory, there is one last important check on a power-mad president, one whose contempt for the laws of the land knows no bounds. That check is the Supreme Court, a body of jurists who serve life terms, and who can strike down illegal actions at will.

Last week, the court issued a ruling in a lawsuit over the birthright citizenship executive order. As it does so often these days, it made an enormously consequential decision without actually making a decision. While declining to actually consider whether or not Trump’s EO is unconstitutional, SCOTUS ruled that lower courts cannot issue a nationwide injunction against that order. But the de facto result is that citizenship is a privilege, and not secured by birth in the 28 states that haven’t sued to challenge one of Trump’s executive orders.

It is an odd decision, not least because birthright citizenship is guaranteed by the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, the first sentence of which reads: “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”

To be clear, SCOTUS didn’t override the 14th Amendment, it just pretended that it would be some kind of a horrible overreach to tell the executive branch that the 14th Amendment is real.

This is alarming for a lot of reasons, but the 14th Amendment in particular — a Reconstruction Amendment enacted after the Civil War — is the cornerstone of modern-day constitutional law.

Before the Civil War and Reconstruction, the Bill of Rights didn’t apply to state governments: New York could abridge its citizens’ right to free speech, even if the federal government couldn’t. The 14th Amendment guarantees that states cannot deprive Americans of “life, liberty, or property, without due process of law,” words that already appeared verbatim in the 5th Amendment (which had previously only applied to the federal government).

The People have rights against the powerful. That is what America is about

It’s notable that these words keep getting repeated — almost like those “unalienable” rights of “life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness” are really important. The Reconstruction Amendments — the 13th, 14th, and 15th — weave together the threads of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the Declaration of Independence. They were a critical update, you might say, one that patched the founders’ system-destroying error of perpetuating slavery while simultaneously declaring all men to be created equal. The 14th acknowledges that states, too, can be tyrants. Whether it is George III, the feds, or the slave-holding antebellum states, the People have rights against the powerful. That is what America is about.

Over the next 150 years, the Supreme Court began to grapple with the admittedly broad categories of life, liberty, and property (and/or pursuit of happiness). The problem is that you can’t just look up “life” and “liberty” in a dictionary and get a bulleted list of what Americans can or cannot do. But by the mid-20th century, the Supreme Court was asserting that Americans have the fundamental right to contraception.

Since condoms aren’t mentioned in the Constitution, the legalese version gets a little complicated. In short, the “penumbra” of rights created by the 1st, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 9th Amendments, applied to the states via the 14th, implies a constitutional right to privacy.

It turned out that Americans really liked not going to jail for not getting pregnant

This seems like a lot of technical steps to get to “the state of Connecticut can’t arrest Mrs. Griswold for handing out diaphragms to women who want to have sex without getting pregnant.” But it turned out that Americans really liked not going to jail for not getting pregnant, almost as much as states loved trying to force people to give birth. Twelve years later, the court handed down Roe v. Wade — the now-overturned precedent that established the right to abortion — relying on the Griswold v. Connecticut right of privacy.

In the decades since, right-wing jurists (who were, completely coincidentally, Catholics subscribing to strong religious proscriptions against contraception and abortion) pushed back. This whole penumbras thing was far too vibes-based, they argued. Right-wing legal theory can be mostly summarized as a backlash against vibes-based jurisprudence. It’s why you get textualism (what really matters is the words as written down) and originalism (what really matters is what the Founding Fathers thought).

Weirdly, these objections stuck. “We’re all textualists now,” said liberal Justice Elena Kagan in 2015, referring to how common it had become to use Justice Antonin Scalia’s textualist methods in assessing laws. Meanwhile, Justice Clarence Thomas keeps a mocking sign in his office that reads, “Please don’t emanate in the penumbras.”

Sometimes it takes a non-legal brain to see through the absolute bullshit that has taken root in the intellectual heart of American courts — bullshit so deep that judges are now turning to AI to tell them what words really mean. The Founding Fathers had some highly specific issues with George III, to be sure, but the very core tenets of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness (and/or property) are pretty vibes-based stuff. These are vibes turned up to 11 in the Declaration of Independence in 1776, enshrined in the Bill of Rights in 1791, and repeated and reiterated in the Reconstruction Amendments in the late 1860s.

The Republican legal mind nickels and dimes the People on their rights, and then goes, “Is this what the founders wanted?” Conveniently, and completely coincidentally, this thinking often works against women, racial minorities, immigrants, and other undesirables. Meanwhile, when the birthright citizenship EO contradicts the plain text of the Constitution, the textualists are nowhere to be found. Kinda gives the whole game away, doesn’t it?

The true objective became clear: to allow the most powerful people in the country to do whatever they wanted

As a result of Donald Trump’s first term in office, the right wing of the Supreme Court gained a supermajority, one it will have for the foreseeable future. The moment this happened, the fig leaf of textualism and respect for the law fell away, and the true objective became clear: to allow the most powerful people in the country to do whatever they wanted.

When the Founding Fathers replaced their king with a new system of government, they were keen on preventing the fledgling nation from reverting back to monarchy. They did this by spreading power around as much as possible. Their first attempt mostly just distributed power among the states; this turned out not to work so well. The second attempt — the one that we presently live under — consolidated more power at the federal level, but diced it up into a tripartite system of government: Congress, the courts, and the president. The idea was that these three branches would all compete for power, keeping any one of them from becoming too powerful.

The court claimed to reshuffle the balance of power last year by overturning the long-standing doctrine of Chevron deference in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, apparently believing that federal agencies under the executive branch — like the guys who make sure your water is clean or the guys who make it so your gym has to let you cancel your membership — had become too powerful. Knocking down Chevron deference essentially meant it was now open season on these regulatory agencies, because now it’s easier than ever to challenge their rule-making. More opportunities to pipe up and complain, you might say. Meanwhile, if the federal government is to regulate air, water, and click-to-cancel, it would be better if the legislative branch wrote actual laws.

But how do you square reducing the power of the executive branch with how Trump’s secret police are assaulting and detaining Democratic lawmakers? Rep. LaMonica McIver was indicted for “forcibly impeding and interfering with federal officers” as they arrested Newark Mayor Ras Baraka for attempting to enter a Newark detention center. Sen. Alex Padilla was wrestled to the ground and handcuffed for attempting to ask a question of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during a press conference. New York City comptroller Brad Lander was arrested at immigration court for accompanying a migrant. The Supreme Court promised us a kneecapped administrative state. When do we get to kneecap ICE?

Forget lawyer-brain for a minute. There’s no need to overthink this supposed tension. The Republican majority of the Supreme Court of the United States has a perfectly coherent worldview: the strong get to trample the weak.

The Republican majority of the Supreme Court of the United States has a perfectly coherent worldview: the strong get to trample the weak

Fossil fuel companies, the crypto industry, and nationwide internet service providers deserve process; the asylum-seeker imprisoned at CECOT does not. A neighborhood wrecked by a hurricane, the gambling addict at rock bottom, the principle of net neutrality itself — these victims of the war on the administrative state simply do not matter. The text doesn’t matter. Constitutional balance doesn’t matter. Only power matters. (In West Virginia v. EPA, the 2021 case that led to Loper Bright, Kagan ruefully called back to her previous “we’re all textualists” remark, writing in her dissent, “It seems I was wrong. The current Court is textualist only when being so suits it.”)

The right-wing Supreme Court’s hypocrisy is not the only thing to blame for our present state of affairs. The Founding Fathers’ tripartite system of government was mostly working out until all three branches succumbed to some kind of contagious monarchism.

But it’s clear the founders’ anti-king protocol is now failing. The executive is an egomaniac who simply does not believe in life, liberty, or due process. Congress, in the firm grip of naked ideologues and flaccid cowards, has flopped as a constitutional counterbalance, incapable of punishing Donald Trump for an actual armed insurrection on January 6th, 2021. The Supreme Court, on the other hand, hasn’t failed — it has actively accelerated the conflagration, even ruling that Trump has absolute immunity for acts on January 6th. This is what makes the court’s Republican supermajority so dangerous, so profoundly immoral. Congress might be too shortsighted, deadlocked, and weak in character to pump the brakes. But SCOTUS, an institution designed to step back and think about the big picture, knows exactly what it’s doing, and is chillingly enthusiastic.

The current Republican Supreme Court is unlike anything the founders could have ever possibly envisioned — a partisan instrument of a destructive political force, neither a check nor a balance on an executive that is threatening to strip citizenship from opposition politicians and is commandeering the state National Guard against a state’s people over the objections of their governor. It is a root-access attack on the system itself, a virus with the ability to overwrite the founding documents of the nation.

“Conservative” has never been more of a misnomer

You can call it a lot of things: right-wing radicalism, dictator envy, anti-democratic theocracy. But one thing’s clear. “Conservative” has never been more of a misnomer. The Republicans are conserving nothing: not due process, not precedent, and certainly not the truth.

In 2006, when he was nominated to the Supreme Court, Samuel Alito told the Senate that Roe v. Wade, the case that once enshrined the right to abortion, had been decided and was “an important precedent.” Sixteen years later, he penned the majority opinion overturning Roe. Justice Alito may have been cagey in the lead-up to his confirmation, but his fellow justices were less so — Neil Gorsuch called Roe v. Wade “the law of the land” in his 2017 Senate confirmation hearings; Brett Kavanaugh supposedly told Sen. Susan Collins in a private meeting in 2018 that Roe was “settled law.” Both justices joined the opinion overturning Roe, which calls that decision “egregiously wrong from the start.”

Fair play and forthrightness are, apparently, not things we expect while appointing a judge to sit atop of the entire American legal system for the rest of their life. But setting that aside, it’s baffling that the right-wing legal establishment is seen as patient and strategic while Trump is a force of nature that might not pass the Turing test.

As Donald Trump’s imperial presidency rolls forward across the wreckage of Congress on tank treads greased by the Supreme Court, there’s scant evidence of a legal movement for limited government or states’ rights. Trump is not the useful tool of an aggressive right-wing movement. Why look for complex explanations when there is a very simple one at hand? He is the king they serve enthusiastically, a leader whose lies and lawlessness they both enable and mirror.

Two-thirds of the country oppose the fall of Roe; about as many reject the total presidential immunity given by Trump v. US. (You see, the Supreme Court is perfectly capable of rocking the boat: when it lets Trump do what he wants to do, it is because this is the America that the Republican justices believe in.)

What’s a red-blooded American to do when their government becomes destructive to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness? The Declaration of Independence has some notes about “the Right of the People to alter or to abolish” its existing government “and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.”

But that was another time, right? Surely nobody wants to take the Founding Fathers’ original words literally. Their original meaning and original intent can’t just be superimposed on American life today, not when American values are very different from the values of 1776. In Trump’s America, the national ethos is simply a boot on your neck, forever.

She's rung up McDonald's orders and roasted coffee, but her least favorite job was working in warehouses preparing fresh food for delivery. No matter how many layers she wore, she was freezing in the refrigerated rooms of produce.

""We were the youngest ones there,"" Hernandez said of herself and her sister, who worked alongside her. They felt out of place surrounded by their colleagues, mostly older migrant workers.

Today, Hernandez is 22 and has a bachelor's degree. She works as a shift lead at a coffee shop in Sacramento, where she lives, earning $17.50 an hour. She wants a career with a salary and benefits, but says not having work authorization or resident status is holding her back. Her discouragement is heightened this summer by reports that Immigration and Customs Enforcement has arrested young people brought to the US by their parents as children as they go about their day, going to school or work.

""It's so frustrating. I came here at 4, so I've lived here my whole entire life,"" Hernandez said. ""I'm from Mexico, but I don't know anything about the country.""

Millions of young immigrants raised and educated in the US are entering adulthood ready to contribute to the economy. Business Insider spoke to Gen Z ""Dreamers"" who came to the US as children and now say they are stuck, unable to fully realize their American dream. As immigration enforcement rises, these undocumented young adults face an uncertain future.

""I want a career,"" Hernandez said. ""I can't be a barista forever.""

'Keep working, keep following the rules, and eventually our time will come'

Juan Robles, 28, has work authorization through DACA, or Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an Obama-era program that is now caught up in a legal battle that paused new applications. Every two years, Robles has to reapply to maintain his status.

""I consider myself American just as much as any other person, and I think I've done a lot,"" said Robles, who came to the US at age 7 in 2004.

But the journey toward building his American dream hasn't been easy. He worked to put himself through college because he wasn't eligible for loans or state grants. The first time he tried to buy a home, DACA recipients weren't eligible for FHA financing. He isn't eligible to receive any Social Security benefits when he retires.

""It was like a slap in the face,"" Robles said of the barriers. ""Not only did we have to work hard for what we have, but we have to work a lot harder just because of who we are.""

In 2022, he cashed out his retirement savings and borrowed $20,000 from his parents to jump-start his business, Juanderful Tacos. He said business has been booming and last year, he owed the IRS $8,759 in taxes from sales.

""People have the audacity to say that immigrants don't pay taxes,"" Robles said.

He hoped his professional efforts and lack of criminal record would prove that he deserves to earn citizenship. With the recent escalation in ICE arrests, he feels a renewed sense of despair. More than a decade since DACA was established, Robles, who lives in Phoenix, is facing the risk of deportation.

""If you are present in the United States illegally, you will be deported,"" Abigail Jackson, a spokesperson for the White House, previously told Business Insider. ""This is the promise President Trump made to the American people that the administration is committed to keeping it.""

Robles and his wife, who is also undocumented, have been outspoken about their status online and are longtime immigrant activists. The bio on their restaurant's Instagram page reads, ""very proudly DACA-owned and operated.""

""We got to just keep our heads down, keep working, keep following the rules, and eventually our time will come,"" Robles said. ""We really can't hope for anything else.""

'What now? I still can't get a job.'

For many in the US, a college degree is an important stepping stone toward the middle class. According to the Social Security Administration, those with higher education degrees earn over $1 million more in median lifetime earnings than their peers without a degree. But a professional career is a much harder step for young people living in the US on DACA status or without permanent legal status.

One undocumented LA-based Gen Zer said she dropped out of Art Center College of Design because she maxed out on the financial aid and loans the state of California offers to non-citizen residents and didn't qualify for federal aid because she isn't a refugee or permanent resident. She's been afraid to continue her work as a freelance photographer due to recent ICE raids in Los Angeles, and has turned down job opportunities, which leaves her worried about paying rent.

Jennifer R. Nájera, a professor of Ethnic Studies at the University of California, Riverside, said that in addition to the professional and financial strain, students without legal status are physically and emotionally affected by the threat of deportation and family separation. Statewide surveys at California's public universities found that 28% of undocumented students and 30% of students with undocumented parents had reported clinical depressive symptoms compared to 21% of their peers.

""There's a lot of disillusion with the American dream among immigrant communities, especially working-class immigrant communities,"" said Nájera, who works with and studies undocumented student activists.

Hernandez can relate. She graduated with a bachelor's in health science from Sacramento State University in 2023, but finding work in her field of study has been harder.

She hoped to receive US citizenship when she married her high school boyfriend in 2024. When the marriage broke up last year, she was on the cusp of securing a green card. She is now on a different pathway to citizenship through the Violence Against Women Act.

Hernandez feels frustrated that she's back to living with her parents and working an hourly wage service job. She wants more for her life, and is attending a community college to become a nurse because immigration status is not a barrier to getting a license in California.

Getting hired at a hospital is a different story: She would need to have US citizenship or a green card. She knows it's a risk to take on additional debt for nursing school when she might not get hired until a multi-year legalization process is over. Hernandez said it's worth it to keep driving toward her goal of making it beyond minimum-wage jobs that don't provide benefits.

""I got my EMT, I got my degree,"" said Hernandez, who doesn't qualify for a paramedic license in California because of her legal status. ""What now? I still can't get a job.""",NewsAPI,-4.05,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,40.61,"business insider, Business Insider, Insider, businessinsider.com, insider.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/,https://ground.news/interest/business-insider,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/insider-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.3),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Axel Springer SE,2007,-1.46,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,businessinsider.com,,business insider,20,USA,,,,

The exodus has been sparked by a national security drive in Tehran, which fears Afghans could be spying for Israel.

Refugees described arbitrary arrests, detentions and widespread abuse by Iranian security forces, and said tensions spiralled after Israel’s strikes on Iran’s nuclear sites and military leadership last month.

“Some chose to return voluntarily, but most were deported by Iran,” said Ahmadullah Muttaqi, the head of Afghanistan’s information and culture department.

Facing extreme high temperatures and a lack of basic facilities, humanitarian organisations have warned of an impending crisis at the Afghanistan-Iran border.

The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), which assists the returnees, said that many Afghans were arriving with “nothing but the clothes on their back” and “in urgent need of food, support and medical care”.

More than 300,000 Afghan nationals have returned via the Islam Qala border crossing in less than two weeks, - AFP

The International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and other groups are providing temporary aid, but they are not equipped to provide long-term support.

Thousands of Afghans fled to Iran seeking refuge after the Taliban’s return to power in 2021, and could face persecution on their return.

Some female returnees said they were denied support by Taliban authorities as they were travelling without an adult male to accompany them.

Iran is home to an estimated six million Afghans, many of whom are undocumented refugees following decades of conflict in their home country.

Although Tehran was once a welcoming host, the regime in May ordered all those it said were there “illegally” to leave by July 6 or face arrest.

A young Afghan who lives in Tehran told The Telegraph that friends had been tortured by police over a spying allegation.

“Four of my friends were accused of spying and taken to a camp and severely tortured,” he told The Telegraph. “They are innocent migrants. They were dragged from their flat, badly beaten, and one of them nearly died.

“I don’t know about their whereabouts now.”

Another said his father was arrested and tortured for several days, again on suspicion of espionage. “He was kept without food and water, and later deported to Afghanistan. We are facing a grave situation here,” he said.

‘Conditions are harsh’

Videos circulating on social media show Iranian security forces raiding sites in Tehran in which Afghan migrants worked.

On June 20, police released footage of two Afghan men they claimed had confessed to spying on sensitive locations, including the state broadcaster’s headquarters and a senior official’s residence.

Security forces also raided a factory in southern Tehran and detained several Afghans accused of assisting Mossad, the Israeli intelligence agency, in plotting drone attacks on air defence systems in Isfahan.

“We are called Israeli spies in the streets and markets,” said an Afghan migrant deportee. “Conditions are harsh and our grievances are ignored.”

Many deportees have told of systematic harassment and arbitrary arrests. “Arrests of Afghans became widespread. Checkpoints sprang up everywhere. They pulled us off buses, accused us of being spies, and took us away for interrogation,” said one.

The Red Cross said many Afghans arrive with ‘nothing but the clothes on their back’ - AFP

Richard Bennett, the UN Special Rapporteur on Afghanistan, said hundreds of Afghans had been detained on espionage charges, and that the Iranian media was inciting hatred and using dehumanising language against Afghan communities.

Fatemeh Mohajerani, an Iranian government spokesman, said last week: “We’ve always striven to be good hosts, but national security is a priority, and naturally illegal nationals must return.”

Between June 1 and July 5, nearly 450,000 Afghans returned from Iran, a spokesman for the IOM said on Monday, bringing the total for the year so far to more than 900,000.

The IFRC said at the weekend that large groups of Afghans, including many children, were arriving via the Islam Qala border crossing, having endured “exhaustion, hunger, and uncertainty on their journey home” in temperatures hovering over 43C.",NewsAPI,-5.69,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/yahoo-news-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Skews Left,40.05,"yahoo entertainment, Yahoo Entertainment, Yahoo!

262,8,"In Taiwan, migrants flee oppressive workplaces for life on the periphery",https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2025/7/8/in-taiwan-migrants-flee-oppressive-workplaces-for-life-on-the-periphery,2025-07-08T00:05:28Z,Al Jazeera English,GB,migrant,"The number of unaccounted for migrants on the island has doubled in the last four years, reaching 90,000 this January.

This story was produced in partnership with the Pulitzer Center.

Taichung City, Taiwan – Bernard keeps a low profile.

Heading to work on the streets of Taiwan, the 45-year-old Filipino migrant worker dodges glances and often checks his face mask to make sure his appearance is concealed.

To hide his accent, he often speaks in a near-whisper.

Often, he declines invitations to social occasions from his fellow countrymen, worried that a “Judas” among them might report him to the authorities.

Hired at one of Taiwan’s many electronics factories, Bernard came to the island legally in 2016.

But since June 2024, he has been among Taiwan’s growing population of undocumented workers. He blames his broker, a private employment agent to which migrants are usually assigned, for his current predicament.

Bernard’s broker tried to confiscate his passport, he said, then tried to convince him to resign and forgo severance payments from his employer.

He refused both times, he said, causing a rift between them.

“They [brokers] only speak to you when they come to collect payments or when they want to trick you,” Bernard, who asked to use a pseudonym out of fear of repercussions, told Al Jazeera.

Brokers in Taiwan take a cut of their clients’ wages and have significant influence over their conditions and job prospects, making their relationships prone to abuse.

When Bernard’s contract expired in 2022, he said, his broker blacklisted him among other employers.

Desperate to support his daughter’s education in the Philippines, Bernard ditched his broker and decided to overstay his visa to work odd construction jobs, he said.

These days, he said, he feels “like a bird in a cage”.

In public, Bernard would not even utter the word “undocumented” in any language, only gesturing with his hands that he ran away.

Taiwan’s undocumented workforce is rising fast.

The number of unaccounted-for migrants on the island has doubled in the last four years, reaching 90,000 this January, according to the Ministry of Labor.

Despite Taiwan’s image as one of the region’s rare liberal democracies, a growing number of Southeast Asian migrant workers are living under the constant threat of deportation and without access to social services.

Taiwan institutionalised its broker system in 1992 in a bid to streamline labour recruitment.

Brokers influence almost every aspect of a migrant worker’s life, from where they live, to their meals, to the terms of their employment contracts, and even how they access public services.

Migrant rights advocates say it is precisely this level of control that is prompting large numbers of workers to flee their workplaces.

Over a third of all complaints made by migrants to the Ministry of Labor are broker-related, according to official data.

As of January 2025, Vietnamese made up the biggest share of the undocumented at 57,611, followed by Indonesians at 28,363, and Filipinos at 2,750.

Joy Tajonera, a Catholic priest who runs the Ugnayan Center, a migrant shelter in Taichung City, said the Taiwanese government has taken a lax approach to the issue.

“The system allows the brokers a power to be used to the disadvantage of migrants,” Tajonera told Al Jazeera.

“Meanwhile, employers play innocent.”

Brokers typically charge migrants a monthly service fee of $50 to $60, and also collect fees for job transfers, hospital insurance, leave, and most of the necessary documentation to work in Taiwan.

In some cases, they impose age limits for certain jobs.

Tajonera said many undocumented workers can actually earn more without a broker, “but then you lose all social protections and health insurance. It’s not that they want to run away. It’s their situation, they can’t take it any more.”

‘Shameless and stupid’

Taiwan’s Labor Ministry said in a statement that the increase in undocumented migrants was driven by pandemic-related disruption to deportations.

It said it has taken various steps to improve conditions for migrant works, including raising the minimum wage, conducting regular inspections of recruitment agencies, introducing a new suspension mechanism for agencies with high rates of absconding workers, and encouraging labour-sending countries to reduce agency fees.

“Through pre-employment orientation for industrial migrant workers and one-stop orientation sessions for household caregivers, the ministry aims to enhance workers’ awareness of legal requirements, inform them of the risks and consequences of going missing, and ensure employers fulfill their management responsibilities,” the ministry said.

However, since last year, the Taiwanese government has also increased the maximum fines for migrants caught overstaying their visas from $330 to $1,657.

Lennon Ying-Da Wang, director of the public migrant shelter Serve the People Association, called the government’s move to increase penalties “shameless and stupid”.

“Instead of addressing the reasons for running away, this will just prevent people from surrendering,” he told Al Jazeera.

Wang said a lack of protections, particularly for those working in childcare and fisheries, is the key reason why many migrants abscond from their workplaces.

Neither industry is subject to Taiwan’s monthly minimum wage of $944, according to Taiwan’s Labor Standards Act.

Wang said migrants in practice often receive half that amount minus deductions by brokers.

“Migrants just want a decent salary,” Wang said. “But there’s an unspoken rule among some brokers not to hire migrant workers who ask for help from shelters. That forces them to run away.”

Despite his sympathies, Wang, as the director of a state-funded facility, is not allowed to take in migrants who have absconded from their employers as they are subject to deportation.

On a quiet, nondescript road at the edge of Taipei lies Harmony Home, an NGO catering to undocumented young mothers and children.

While the women and children who stay at Harmony Home cannot be deported for humanitarian reasons, the state is not obligated to shoulder the costs of their care or medical needs.

Harmony Home, which has taken in more than 1,600 children over the past two decades, has recently seen a sharp uptick in minors coming through its doors, founder Nicole Yang said.

“Last year, we had about 110 new kids. By April this year, we’ve already got 140,” Yang told Al Jazeera.

“We also care for 300 others who live at home while their mother works.”

Li-Chuan Liuhuang, a labour expert at National Chung Cheng University, said that while the broker system will be difficult to “uproot immediately”, the government could improve oversight by “making the recruitment procedure and cost structure more transparent”.

In Lishan, a mountainous area of Taichung, hundreds of undocumented Southeast Asians pick peaches, pears and cabbages for local landowners. The presence of runaway migrants, many of whom fled fishing trawlers, is not only tolerated but relied upon for the harvest.

Liuhuang said she would like to see such migrants being allowed to work on farms with proper labour protections, but she believes this would not be easy for the public to accept.

“The government will have to commit more efforts for this kind of dialogue,” she told Al Jazeera.

Mary, who asked to use a pseudonym, said she absconded from her job as a childcare worker to work illegally at various mountain farms after becoming frustrated at earning less than half the minimum wage and having her grievances ignored by her broker.

Sitting beside a cabbage patch, Mary, 46, said she always felt anxious around the police in the city.

But in Lishan the rules are different, she said, as landowners have an unwritten agreement with the authorities about the runaways.

“There’s no way the boss doesn’t have connections with the police. He always knows when they come and tells us not to go out,” she told Al Jazeera.

Even so, there is no guarantee of avoiding mistreatment in the mountains.

After the harvest, employers sometimes withhold payments, threatening anyone who complains with deportation, Mary said.

“If I complain that the boss doesn’t give me the salary, I will get reported. Who will help me?” she said.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,
263,8,"Poland imposes controls on Germany, Lithuania borders to check migration",https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/8/poland-imposes-controls-on-germany-lithuania-borders-to-check-migration,2025-07-08T09:51:02Z,Al Jazeera English,GB,migrant,"Polish government says step aimed to check migrants more thoroughly amid public concerns over immigration.

Poland has reintroduced temporary checks on its borders with Germany and Lithuania, citing a growing influx of undocumented migrants and increasing public concern over security.

Prime Minister Donald Tusk announced the move on Monday, arguing that Warsaw needed to “redirect” migration routes that bypass barriers along the Belarusian border and instead pass through neighbouring Latvia and Lithuania.

“To redirect this stream of people, which is deflected by our barrier, but which wants to cross Poland again through the border with Latvia and Lithuania, and further into Europe,” Tusk said.

The decision came amid heightened tensions across Europe over irregular migration, with other Schengen members like Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands having already taken similar steps over the past 18 months, putting strain on the European Union’s passport-free travel zone.

Germany has maintained controls on its border with Poland since 2023, but recently adopted a tougher approach, rejecting undocumented arrivals and sending them back to Poland under EU and bilateral agreements.

Polish authorities say this has placed an unfair burden on their country.

Knut Abraham, Germany’s envoy for Polish relations, warned the new checks could cause traffic congestion and disrupt trade, without curbing migration effectively. Similar concerns were raised by Rafal Gronicz, mayor of the border town of Zgorzelec, who dismissed fears of a migrant crisis as exaggerated.

“As long as I live, I have never known anyone who wanted to escape from Germany to Poland,” he told local radio. “There are no pressing waves of migrants walking around Zgorzelec.”

Polish Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak said checks on the German border will be lifted when Berlin ends its tougher controls.

“If Germany lifts its controls, we are not going to delay either,” Siemoniak said. “We want this movement to be absolutely free, that the problems of illegal migrant and migration be resolved together, without either side suffering.”

Tensions have escalated in recent weeks in Poland after a Venezuelan national was charged with murdering a 24-year-old woman in Torun. That killing triggered mass protests led by nationalist groups, with some 10,000 people marching on Sunday in her memory.

A separate incident on Saturday saw a Polish man fatally stabbed during a brawl in the northern town of Nowe. Authorities said on Monday that 13 people had been arrested – three Poles and 10 Colombians. Angry crowds gathered outside a workers’ hostel where the Colombians had been staying, state media reported.

Far-right groups have also begun patrolling Poland’s western frontier, claiming to protect the country from migrant flows. Human rights organisations condemned these vigilante efforts, warning they fuel xenophobia and undermine trust in official institutions.

“The actions of these self-proclaimed groups are the result of a radicalising political narrative,” said the Helsinki Foundation for Human Rights. “Debate on migration should be grounded in facts, not fear.”",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,
264,17,Gaza officials say children killed in strike as Israeli military admits 'error',https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rvxjnvv71o,2025-07-13T09:02:28Z,BBC News,GB,refugee,"Gaza officials say children killed in strike as Israeli military admits 'error'

Relatives mourn Palestinian child Saraj Ibrahim. In other photos and video, the man in grey is seen carrying the child's body after a strike hit a water distribution point

The Israeli military said there had been a ""technical error"" with a strike targeting an Islamic Jihad ""terrorist"" that caused the munition to fall dozens of metres from the target. The incident is under review, the military added.

Eyewitnesses said a drone fired a missile at a crowd queuing with empty jerry cans next to a water tanker in al-Nuseirat refugee camp.

Their bodies were sent to Nuseirat's al-Awda Hospital, which also treated 16 injured people including seven children, a doctor there said.

Ten people, including six children, have been killed in an Israeli air strike while waiting to fill water containers in central Gaza on Sunday, emergency service officials say.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it was aware of the ""claim regarding casualties in the area as a result"", adding that it works to mitigate civilian harm ""as much as possible"" and ""regrets any harm to uninvolved civilians"".

Verified video of the aftermath shows dozens of people rushing to help injured people, including children, lying among yellow jerry cans.

BBC Verify was able to pinpoint the location by matching it with the position of nearby rooftops, trees and telegraph poles.

It was filmed early morning local time, going by shadows, on a road about 80m (262ft) south-west of the Nuseirat Junior High School. The site itself is two buildings along from another building listed online as a kindergarten.

Satellite imagery from three weeks ago shows a tanker truck parked across the street.

From the video, it cannot be determined what struck the site and, if it was a malfunctioning Israeli munition, from which direction it had been fired.

The strike came as Israeli aerial attacks across the Gaza Strip have escalated.

A spokesperson for Gaza's Civil Defence Agency said 19 other Palestinians had been killed on Sunday, in three separate strikes on residential buildings in central Gaza and Gaza City.

Separately, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said it had treated more mass casualty cases at its Rafah field hospital in southern Gaza in the last six weeks than in the 12 months before that.

It said that its field hospital in Rafah had received 132 patients ""suffering from weapon-related injuries"" on Saturday, 31 of whom died.

The ""overwhelming majority"" of the patients had gunshot wounds, it added, and ""all responsive individuals"" reported they had been trying to access food distribution sites.

It said that the hospital had treated more than 3,400 weapon-wounded patients and recorded more than 250 deaths since new food distribution sites opened on 27 May - exceeding ""all mass casualty cases treated at the hospital"" in the year prior.

""The alarming frequency and scale of these mass casualty incidents underscore the horrific conditions civilians in Gaza are enduring,"" the ICRC said.

On Saturday, southern Gaza's Nasser hospital said 24 people were killed near an aid distribution site, where witnesses said Israeli troops had opened fire as people were trying to access food.

The Israeli military said there were ""no known injured individuals"" from IDF fire near the site. Separately, a military official said warning shots were fired to disperse people who the IDF believed were a threat.

The UN human rights office said on Friday that it had so far recorded 789 aid-related killings.

It said that of those, 615 were in the vicinity of the US and Israeli-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF)'s sites, which opened on 27 May and are operated by US private security contractors inside military zones in southern and central Gaza.

The other 183 killings were recorded near UN and other aid convoys.

The Israeli military said it recognised there had been incidents in which civilians had been harmed and that it was working to minimise ""possible friction between the population and the [Israeli] forces as much as possible"".

The GHF accused the UN of using ""false and misleading"" statistics from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

GHF boss Johnnie Moore previously told the BBC he was not denying deaths near aid sites, but said ""100% of those casualties are being attributed to close proximity to GHF"" and that was ""not true"".

PA Media Police previously said officers had been attacked during protests

A police force has denied it ""bussed"" pro-refugee protesters to a demonstration outside a hotel housing asylum seekers. Essex Police said it was ""categorically wrong"" to suggest officers inflamed tensions during a protest at The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex, on 17 July. The pro-refugee group went on to clash with rival protesters, with Chief Constable Ben-Julian Harrington condemning the ""thugs and vandals"" responsible. Essex Police said 10 arrests had been made during the protests after eight police officers and two members of hotel staff were injured.

More than 1,000 people have attended demonstrations across 13, 17 and 20 July after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual offences, which he has denied.

Stuart Woodward/BBC Ben-Julian Harrington told journalists that Epping had been targeted by a minority of ""thugs and vandals""

Mr Harrington said the protests began peacefully but ""escalated to the point of disorder and criminal damage"". But claims about counter-demonstrators being driven to the protests by officers led to Reform UK leader Nigel Farage calling for the chief constable to resign. He accused Essex Police of being ""absolutely disgraceful"" in how it handled clashes between rival protesters, which led to missiles being thrown. However, a spokesman for the force said the claims were ""categorically wrong"". ""Officers did provide a foot cordon around protesters on their way to the protest, where they and others were allowed to exercise their right to protest,"" he said. ""Later, some people who were clearly at risk of being hurt were also escorted by vehicle away from the area for their safety.""

'Unacceptable violence'

Four men have been charged with violent disorder in connection to the protests on 17 July. One of them was also accused of criminally damaging a hotel sign, while a fifth man was accused of refusing to remove a face covering. In an update to the gathered media in Chelmsford, Essex, Mr Harrington thanked people who had behaved ""peacefully and lawfully"". But he added: ""What has been unacceptable has been the people who have come to Epping and committed violence, who have attacked people who work at the hotel, who have attacked officers, who have damaged property and who have caused fear and disruption to the people of Epping.""

Simon Dedman/BBC Police have been accused of ""giving protesters lifts"" to the demonstration

The chief constable said there was a robust operation in place ahead of future protests advertised online. He urged people not to spread misinformation online, insisting it had ""real world consequences"". Later on Wednesday, Essex Police announced a dispersal order had been put in place from 14:00 BST on Thursday to 08:00 on Friday ""to ensure our community in Epping is safe"". The order will give officers the power to direct anyone suspected of committing anti-social behaviour, or planning to do so, to leave the area of face arrest. Ch Supt Simon Anslow said: ""We have identified a small group of people who are intent on committing anti-social behaviour which is not acceptable. ""This order will not prevent lawful and peaceful protest, but ensure people are safe both during and after the planned activity. ""We are considering the use of other powers available to us to ensure people can carry out their democratic right to protest safely.""

OS A dispersal order has been put in place for Epping on Thursday and Friday

The demonstrations followed a man living in the hotel being charged with sexual assault, harassment and inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity. Hadush Kebatu, 41, from Ethiopia, has denied the offences and was remanded in custody during a hearing on Thursday. Protests have also been staged outside the Britannia International Hotel in London's Canary Wharf after it was designated as asylum accommodation. Andrew Wood, a former Tower Hamlets Conservative councillor, told the BBC the hotel became asylum housing within the past few days. The Home Office refused to confirm if that was true, but denied rumours on social media that migrants from The Bell Hotel were being moved there. However, a spokesman for Tower Hamlets Council said: ""We are aware of the government's decision to use the Britannia Hotel in Canary Wharf to provide temporary accommodation for asylum seekers.""

US President Donald Trump has said Hamas ""didn't really want to make a deal"" on a new Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, after the US and Israel withdrew their negotiating teams from Qatar. US envoy Steve Witkoff said on Thursday night that the response by the Palestinian armed group to the latest proposal showed ""a lack of desire"". He added ""alternative options"" to bring home the hostages still held by Hamas would be considered - something Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu echoed. There was no immediate Hamas response to Trump's comments, but the group earlier expressed surprise about what it called Witkoff's ""negative"" remarks, and an official said the group had been told Israeli negotiators would return to Doha next week.

All sides involved in the talks - including the mediators from the US, Qatar and Egypt - acknowledge that wide gaps remain on key issues, including Israeli troop withdrawals, aid distribution, and a permanent cessation of hostilities.

In his statement announcing the withdrawal of the US team from Doha, Witkoff said: ""While the mediators have made a great effort, Hamas does not appear to be co-ordinated or acting in good faith. ""We will now consider alternative options to bring the hostages home and try to create a more stable environment for the people of Gaza. ""It is a shame that Hamas has acted in this selfish way. We are resolute in seeking an end to this conflict and a permanent peace in Gaza."" Netanyahu's office had earlier said in a statement that Israeli negotiators would leave Qatar for additional consultations ""in light of the response conveyed by Hamas"", but it did not give any more details. A senior Israeli official in Doha - speaking on the condition of anonymity - later briefed Israeli journalists that there was ""no explosion, no collapse"" in the talks, the Times of Israel reported. But the official did criticise what they called Hamas's ""rejectionist and unfortunate approach"", saying its latest response did ""not allow progress without a shift"" in the group's positions. On Friday afternoon, Netanyahu wrote on X: ""Witkoff got it right. Hamas is the obstacle to a hostage release deal."" ""Together with our US allies, we are now considering alternative options to bring our hostages home, end Hamas's terror rule, and secure lasting peace for Israel and our region."" At around the same time, Trump told reporters outside the White House: ""It was too bad. Hamas didn't really want to make a deal. I think they want to die."" He added: ""Now we're down to the final hostages, and they know what happens after you get the final hostages. And basically because of that, they really didn't want to make a deal."" There was no immediate response from Hamas, but the group said in a statement early on Friday that it was ""surprised by the negative statements"" from Witkoff on its position. ""The movement affirms its keenness to continue negotiations and engage in them in a manner that helps overcome obstacles and leads to a permanent ceasefire agreement,"" it added. A senior Hamas official later told the BBC that the mediators had informed the group that the negotiations had not collapsed. They said the mediators had also conveyed that the Israeli delegation was expected to return to Doha next week, though no specific date had been set. The two sides have been unable to reach agreement on a US proposal for a 60-day ceasefire that would see the staggered release of 10 living Israeli hostages by Hamas and the bodies of 18 other hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails. Fifty hostages are still being held in Gaza, at least 20 of whom are believed to be alive. A senior Palestinian official told the BBC on Wednesday that their latest response focused primarily on three key issues: the mechanism for the entry and distribution of humanitarian aid into Gaza, maps detailing the withdrawal of Israeli troops from territory they have captured, and a guarantee that the ceasefire would lead to a permanent end to the war.

A Guatemalan artist dips her brush into crimson red paint, the color of the rising sun in Maya tradition, as she paints a mural as big as two parked cars.

A 26-year-old rapper from Bolivia brings his own touch to Spanish hip-hop, adding in words from his dad's indigenous language.

A Mexican-American dad and his two daughters, a teen and a tween, demonstrate techniques for shaping a guitar that were passed down from their great-grandfather in Mexico — the same methods their dad now uses to restore guitars for Dolly Parton and her band.

Two refugee weavers, one in her 60s and one in her 20s, make a traditional bag. They're on a mission to revitalize their ancient art form.

They were among the artisans at this year's Smithsonian Folklife Festival in Washington, D.C. The theme was youth and the future of culture.

The Goats and Soda team sat down with four ensembles rooted in the Global South to talk about their craft, the youth they mentor and the familial and cultural traditions they're keeping alive.

Keeping Maya identity alive with paint

He wanted a pencil.

That request from a little boy in a remote village in Guatemala convinced Evelyn del Rosario Morán Cojoc that her art lessons were really resonating.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

""I have art classes in the villages where they don't have enough to eat,"" Evelyn del Rosario Morán Cojoc says, wiping away tears of joy as she spoke through an interpreter. ""A young boy came up to me and approached me. I thought he was going to ask me for food but he asked me for a pencil. He had a hunger for knowledge.""

The 42-year-old painter from Guatemala has been an avid teacher since 2012, leading art sessions across the country that explore her indigenous Poqomchiʼ Maya roots. Though indigenous culture is often marginalized, Morán Cojoc embraces her identity and passes that pride on. She encourages kids to depict elements from their indigenous culture, such as cacao — the raw bean the Maya considered a sacred gift from the gods (and that's the source of chocolate).

She helps her students reclaim what others try to dismiss.

""Discrimination exists because of others. It's their sadness, it's their ignorance, it's their willingness to not comprehend that results in racism,"" Morán Cojoc says. ""Humans came into this world naked, and if we were to someday be naked again, we would understand how much more we are alike.""

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

At the festival, her mission was to create a mural reflecting the indigenous culture of Guatemala. She was joined by three eager area high school students originally from Latin America. She says that working with youngsters makes her feel whole. ""My work is because of the youth. Kids are like sponges and really want to learn so much.""

Their assignment: to incorporate at least one part of their Maya identity into the painting.

Kevin Cabrera Sanchez, 17, who lives in Virginia, is an avid marimba player and added Guatemala's national instrument to the piece.

""I'm just really happy,"" he says. ""[Our] culture is dying, so it's really important to preserve it and spread awareness of people's different backgrounds.""

Another student, Selvin Vail Diaz, 18, painted four colorful varieties of maíz (corn) – sapphire blue, crimson red, golden yellow and ivory white. Each color relates to one of the four points of the compass: for example, white is the north, representing the afterlife.

Reflecting on the symbolism — and the belief that the Maya culture vanished after colonization — Morán Cojoc observes: ""People say that the Maya don't exist anymore, but that's not true. We are a part of history. We have existed before, and we are continuing to live.""

South American hip-hop with an indigenous twist

""I combine my language with hip-hop so that, via hip-hop, my culture could continue living,"" says Eber Quisbert, a 40-year-old Bolivian rapper.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

Quisbert performs with his mentee and fellow Bolivian rapper, Carlos Orellana, 26, whose stage name is Andes Mc . The performers mix Spanish lyrics with Quechua and Aymara, two indigenous languages. Orellana's dad grew up speaking Quechua but did not pass the language onto his son. In a country where Spanish dominates, native tongues are regarded as inferior by some Bolivians.

Orellana now embraces Quechua as part of his heritage — along with tattoos of ancient creatures, including a swirl of animals encircling a war god known as the decapitator, whom he discovered in an archaeology book about the pre-Columbian Tiwanaku civilization. Clutching a weapon with a human head affixed to the end, and adorned with condor wings and deer antlers from his dismembered victims, the mythical creature conveys strength and transformation.

""My father comes from a town that speaks Quechua, but he never taught me it because there was a lot more racism at that time,"" Orellana recalls through an interpreter. ""As I got older, I started to connect more to Quechua. I actually sometimes sprinkle in some Quechua words into my Spanish without even realizing it.""

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

Quisbert performs under the stage name Eber Miranda, which combines his name with his grandmother's surname. He wears his indigenous pride on a purple flat-brim baseball hat that reads ""Aymara"" in graffiti-style font. He's part of Bolivia's group of hip-hop artists who began integrating indigenous language into their music in the early 2000s.

""Languages are like living beings. They are born, they grow and then they have families,"" he explains through his wife, who interprets for him.

One of the songs they performed, ""Jina Jina Mayma,"" tells the story of tensions between Bolivia's indigenous regions, blending their Quechua and Guarani languages. The title means ""Let's go, everyone.""

""We created a song like this because everyone just wants to live peacefully,"" Quisbert recalls. His lyrics aim to inspire unity and peace: ""I'm from here, you're from there. Let's join hands, ready to move forward. Shout for liberty to the beat of equality. Leave behind prejudice, we are just one.""

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

On Monday, the two invited young festival participants to join them on stage and perform original pieces. Veronica Cvar, 17, of Fairfax, Va., was the first to perform, rapping in Spanish. ""[My rap] was all about being able to find your true self and not letting anybody change who you are,"" she explains.

Reflecting on the mentorship he received from Quisbert, Orellana says interacting with the youth continues to make his work meaningful.

""I'm very excited to at least plant a seed in one person,"" he says. ""Community and culture can start with one person and expand from there.""

Weaving a bond between old and young

""I can't speak English or drive, but what I can do is hold onto my culture and tradition, and pass it down to young people,"" says Rosie Say, speaking through an interpreter at the festival.

She does it by weaving. Strung taut between a wooden pole and her waist, red and white threads stretch to form a long strip of cloth with a striped pattern. Take a few steps back, and the loom looks like a miniature suspension bridge – one that carries centuries of history across a span no wider than a yoga mat.

Rosie and Ku Say share the same last name, and although they're not related, Ku, 24, says Rosie, 65, is like family.

""We have been working together for so long,"" Ku explains. ""She reminds me of my aunt who lived in the refugee camp because they have been through hard times.""

Rosie and Ku are both part of the Karen Weaving Circle , a group of multigenerational refugee weavers from the Karen (pronounced kuh-REN) ethnic group .

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

After facing decades of conflict and discrimination in Myanmar, many Karen people fled to refugee camps along the border with Thailand in the 1980s. Rosie was part of the exodus and eventually immigrated to St. Paul, Minn., where she is recognized as a master weaver.

While her title might suggest decades of experience, the art is fairly new to Rosie. She picked up the hobby 10 years ago and doesn't sell her work.

""When I immigrated to America, I struggled with depression, so I decided to join the weaving group,"" Rosie recalls. ""It helps keep me busy and forget about the past.""

Ku, who was born in a Thai refugee camp, started weaving at 15, learning the craft from her mom and Rosie.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

""I didn't get a chance to learn my history at all,"" Ku says. ""The Karen people in Myanmar weren't allowed to speak their native language or study their history. They had to hide their true identity.""

""I feel proud when I weave because I feel like I have an opportunity to learn about my tradition,"" she adds. ""One day, I want to pass it along to a new generation.""

These guitar makers keep Dolly Parton — and a nearly century-old family tradition — in tune

Manuel Delgado's family business is a key player in the rhythm of Music City, making and restoring guitars. It's in his blood — his family first started the craft in 1928. And now his daughters, Ava and Lila Delgado, 17 and 11, carry on the legacy as fourth-generation luthiers.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

The sisters embrace the ways their great-grandfather built and repaired instruments.

""Everything is old-world, traditional techniques from Mexico,"" Ava emphasizes. When crafting a Mexican guitarrón used in mariachi music, they use tacote wood for the top of the instrument. Once the wood is cut, they carve the neck and heel from a single block using tools like hand saws, chisels and sandpaper rather than modern power tools — and believe that this traditional method improves the tone of the instrument.

Their store has a three-year waitlist for instruments that take months to create.

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

The family's artisanship has attracted stars like Los Lobos, who own custom guitars made by all three generations of the Delgado family.

For the sisters, involvement in the family business started at an early age. They each built their first instruments at age 9. Manuel, who's 53, emphasizes that they built the guitars on their own with some guidance from him. ""I have hours and hours of video of them building the instruments because I didn't want someone to say they just posed,"" he adds.

While the sisters love the family guitar-making company, they're not sure if they'll go on to run it or pave their own paths.

""There's definitely an urge and a desire to want the business to continue,"" Ava says. ""We're losing so much culture and stuff like that, so to keep this raw, handmade thing alive is important.""

toggle caption Ben de la Cruz/NPR

Manuel is content with the business ending with him if his daughters choose to go their separate ways. In the meantime, he remains committed to his work — and using his skills to emphasize his cultural identity.

""I'm seeing people that look like me, have names like me getting thrown to the ground and arrested,"" Manuel says. ""Now I feel a greater sense of responsibility to make sure I continue [my family's] story through our craft. I think when you do that, people meet you on a different level, and they start to see you for who you are rather than who they think you are.""

Hooray for America as a global police state.

In June, the Washington Post reported that the U.S. had $12 million worth of contraceptives and HIV-prevention medications sitting in warehouses in Belgium and the United Arab Emirates—and they were likely to be destroyed unless the U.S. found someone to buy them. On Friday, the Guardian reported that “the decision had been made,” and our country ’tis of thee is going to destroy $9.7 million worth of IUDs and birth control implants. On Wednesday, Reuters further reported that the contraceptives will be burned at a facility in France.

The Belgian foreign ministry, which said it had tried to find a solution with the U.S., told Reuters: “Despite these efforts, and with full respect for our partners, no viable alternative could be secured. Nevertheless, Belgium continues to actively seek solutions to avoid this regrettable outcome. Sexual and reproductive health must not be subject to ideological constraints.”

Destroying the contraceptives, which will cost taxpayers $167,000, is part of DOGE’s plan to slash government “waste,” which includes slashing 83% of the Agency for International Development, or USAID. This is also why 500 tons of food aid meant for starving children in conflict zones is also set to be incinerated.

According to two congressional aides who visited the Belgium warehouse and spoke to the Guardian, the contraceptives were likely intended for Africa, and meant for women in established crisis areas, like refugee camps and war zones. A State Department spokesperson told the outlet that most of the contraceptives had less than 70% of their shelf life before expiration—but Reuters confirmed the expiration dates are between April 2027 and September 2031.

The State Department also claims they couldn’t find “eligible buyers” (hoo-rah for capitalism); eligible being the key word. After his inauguration in January, Trump quickly reinstated the “global gag rule,” a devastating policy that blocks federal funding and/or aid to any international organization that even so much as whispers the word abortion. In other words, “eligible” likely means an organization that doesn’t perform or discuss them.

Case in point: MSI Reproductive Choices, an organization that provides family planning services in over 40 countries, offered to buy the contraceptives. They ultimately weren’t able to pay full price, along with the transportation costs, but MSI performs abortions and told the Guardian they doubted the administration would have sold to them regardless.

“This is a waste of US taxpayer dollars and an abdication of US global leadership in preventing unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths,” Senator Jeanne Shaheen (D-New Hampshire) wrote in a letter to Secretary of State Mark Rubio on June 30. Senator Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) also signed the letter, but she doesn’t get praise for advocating for women abroad while she’s screwing women over at home.

“This is clearly not about saving money,” Sarah Shaw, the associate director for advocacy at MSI, told Reuters. “It feels more like an ideological assault on reproductive rights, and one that is already harming women.”

Anadolu via Getty Images Smoke rises over western Deir al-Balah during an Israeli offensive on Monday

The World Health Organization (WHO) says Israel's offensive in central Gaza has compromised its efforts to continue working, after its facilities came under attack. The UN agency accused Israeli forces of attacking a staff residence in the city of Deir al-Balah on Monday and mistreating those sheltering there. Its main warehouse was also attacked and destroyed. The WHO said one of its staff detained by troops during the raid on the residence was still being held and demanded their immediate release. The Israeli military said it detained ""several individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism"" in the area and that most were released.

The first major Israeli ground operation in Deir al-Balah since the start of the war has displaced tens of thousands of civilians, amid warnings of a severe hunger crisis. Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry said on Tuesday that 33 people, including 12 children, had died from malnutrition across the territory over the past 48 hours. The UN also said it had received growing reports of children and adults suffering from malnutrition and warned that ""the last lifelines keeping people alive are collapsing"".

On Sunday, the Israeli military ordered the immediate evacuation of six city blocks in southern Deir al-Balah, warning that it would be operating ""with great force to destroy the enemy's capabilities and terrorist infrastructure"". The estimated 50,000 to 80,000 people living in the affected areas were instructed to head south towards the al-Mawasi area in the south of the territory. The UN's humanitarian office said UN staff would remain in Deir al-Balah despite the evacuation order, spread across dozens of premises whose co-ordinates had been shared with Israel, and stressed that they had to be protected. On Monday night, the WHO put out a statement saying it condemned ""in the strongest terms"" attacks on its facilities. It said the WHO staff residence was attacked three times, and that staff and their families, including children, were ""exposed to grave danger and traumatized after air strikes caused a fire and significant damage"". ""Israeli military entered the premises, forcing women and children to evacuate on foot toward al-Mawasi amid active conflict. Male staff and family members were handcuffed, stripped, interrogated on the spot, and screened at gunpoint,"" it added. ""Two WHO staff and two family members were detained. Three were later released, while one staff member remains in detention."" The WHO demanded the immediate release of its detained staff member and the protection of its other staff, who have been relocated with their families to its office in Deir al-Balah. The WHO said its main warehouse in the city was damaged after ""an attack caused explosions and fire inside"". The warehouse was later looted by desperate crowds, it added. The agency did not attribute blame for the attack, but said it was ""part of a pattern of systematic destruction of health facilities"". The WHO warned that its operational presence in Gaza was ""now compromised, crippling efforts to sustain a collapsing health system and pushing survival further out of reach for more than two million people"". The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said in a statement on Tuesday its troops had come under fire in the Deir al-Balah area and ""responded toward the area from which the shooting originated"". Without mentioning the WHO, the IDF said it had warned civilians to evacuate beforehand and had also been ""in contact with the international organisations working in the area"". ""As part of IDF activity against the terrorist organisations in the area, the troops detained several individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism,"" it added. ""After questioning in the field, the majority were released and evacuated from the area in co-ordination with the international organisations. It should be emphasized that the suspects are treated in accordance with international law.""

The aim of the Israeli offensive in Deir al-Balah is not year clear. But Israel's Haaretz newspaper said troops were operating to ""establish a corridor that will cut through the city, severing it from the al-Mawasi area and preventing free movement between central Gaza refugee camps where the Israeli army has no ground presence"". Israeli sources say that the possible presence of Israeli hostages held by Hamas is one reason why Deir al-Balah has so far not been the target of a ground offensive. At least 20 of the 50 hostages still in captivity are believed to be alive. Hostages' families have expressed concern that an offensive could endanger them.

Wounded 'left to bleed without treatment'

Medics said shellfire killed at least three Palestinians in Deir al-Balah on Monday, as Israeli tanks advanced into southern and eastern areas. Another two people were killed on Tuesday, according to the Hamas-run Civil Defence agency. In northern Gaza, at least 14 people were killed and 25 wounded overnight when tents for displaced families were hit by two shells in al-Shati refugee camp, west of Gaza City, a local hospital said. Children and women were among the casualties, it added. Raed Bakr said a ""massive explosion"" blew away the tent where he lives with his three children. ""I felt like I was in a nightmare. Fire, dust, smoke and body parts flying through the air, dirt everywhere. The children were screaming,"" he told AFP news agency. According to the UN, about 87.8% of Gaza is now covered by Israeli evacuation orders or is within Israeli militarised zones, leaving the 2.1 million population squeezed into about 46 sq km (18 sq miles) of land where essential services have collapsed. Asma Mustafa, a mother of two and teacher who has just been displaced for the ninth time during the war, said Gaza was ""a place of death, hunger and exhaustion"". ""Clean water is a dream. The wounded are left to bleed without treatment. Children cry from hunger and mothers are powerless. We are living through a slow miserable death,"" she said in a message to the BBC's Newsday programme. UN human rights chief Volker Türk said in a statement: ""It seemed the nightmare couldn't possibly get any worse. And yet it does."" ""Given the concentration of civilians in the area, and the means and methods of warfare employed by Israel until now, the risks of unlawful killings and other serious violations of international humanitarian law are extremely high,"" he said.

Israeli air strikes have killed at least 12 people, including five Hezbollah fighters, in eastern Lebanon, according to Lebanese state media reports, in what Israel said was a warning to the armed group against trying to re-establish itself.

Eight other people were wounded on Tuesday in the Israeli air strikes that hit the Wadi Fara area in the northern Bekaa Valley, including a camp for displaced Syrians, Lebanon’s National News Agency said.

The Israeli military said its air strikes targeted training camps used by elite Hezbollah fighters and warehouses the group used to store weapons.

The air strikes were the deadliest on the area since a United States-brokered ceasefire between Lebanon and Israel last November – a truce repeatedly violated by Israel, which has carried out near-daily strikes across parts of the country.

Bachir Khodr, governor of the Bekaa region, said seven of the dead were Syrian nationals.

Israel dealt Hezbollah significant blows in last year’s war, assassinating its leader Hassan Nasrallah along with other commanders and destroying much of its arsenal.

Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz said Tuesday’s strikes sent a “clear message” to Hezbollah, accusing it of planning to rebuild the capability to raid Israel through the elite Radwan force.

Israel “will respond with maximum force to any attempt at rebuilding”, he said. He added that strikes were also a message to the Lebanese government, saying it was responsible for upholding the ceasefire agreement.

There was no immediate public response from Hezbollah or from the Lebanese government to the latest Israeli strikes.

Under the November ceasefire deal, Hezbollah was to pull its fighters back north of the Litani River, about 30 kilometres (20 miles) from the Israeli border, leaving the Lebanese army and United Nations peacekeepers as the only armed parties in the region.

Israel was required to fully withdraw its troops from the country, but has kept them in five places it deems strategic.

The US has submitted a proposal to the Lebanese government aimed at securing Hezbollah’s disarmament within four months in exchange for Israel halting air strikes and withdrawing troops from the positions they still hold in south Lebanon.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

toggle caption Rebecca Rosman for NPR

GAZIANTEP, Turkey — After more than a decade in exile, Syrians around the world are asking themselves a once unthinkable question: Is it finally time to go home?

When the civil war broke out in 2011, millions fled Syria. No country took in more refugees than neighboring Turkey, which opened its doors to nearly 3 million Syrians, according to the U.N. refugee agency.

But that welcome has in some cases worn thin. In recent years, many Syrians say they've felt increasingly cast out of Turkish society — blamed for the country's economic troubles and treated as scapegoats in political discourse.

Still, many stayed. Some wanted to remain close to home. Others believed their exile would be short.

A few weeks of waiting became months. Then years. At a certain point, the idea of returning began to feel impossible.

That changed in December 2024, when President Bashar al-Assad fell from power: After 24 years, his regime collapsed in a matter of days. The door to a new era creaked open.

Now, with a transitional government in place, hope is stirring — but so is fear. More than half a million Syrians have returned, according to the U.N. refugee agency. But going back requires a leap of faith.

Sectarian violence has flared in recent months. Sanctions are starting to lift, reconnecting Syria with the international economy, but roads, railways and homes remain in ruins. Years of conflict have decimated basic services. Electricity and water are still unreliable in many areas. And doubts persist about Syria's interim leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, who was once linked to al-Qaida.

So how are Syrians weighing the risks of return? Can home ever truly be home again after such devastation — after friends and family have been tortured or killed, after childhood homes were looted or destroyed?

NPR spoke with four Syrians and their families in southern Turkey, each standing at a crossroads.

After leaving one life behind, are they prepared to do it all over again?

Adham Aljamous, 32. ""Your dreams are just dreams.""

An economics student, 32-year-old Adham Aljamous speaks more like a poet.

Sponsor Message

""Even the things you hate,"" he says, ""once you're forced to leave your home — you start to love and miss.""

From the rooftop he shares with his parents in Gaziantep, a city in southeastern Turkey near the Syrian border, Aljamous leafs through a plastic bag of old family photos — one of the few things his family carried when they fled Syria in 2014.

The images capture golden afternoons and family gatherings overflowing with food — the kind of memories, he says, that only grew sweeter in exile.

The family came to Turkey after his older brother Tamam, who ran a humanitarian group in Syria's capital of Damascus, was targeted by the Assad regime. The family thought they'd be gone for a few weeks. That was 11 years ago.

Aljamous still has another year of school before finishing his master's at a university in Gaziantep.

But he says the question he once asked — will I ever return? — has shifted. Now it's how, and at what cost?

""When the circumstances are suitable,"" he says, ""there will be a return to homeland. Inshallah,"" God willing.

But suitable is a high bar. Cities are shattered. Infrastructure is unreliable. And while the United States and Europe are lifting most sanctions on Syria, the economy is a disaster.

It's still unclear what kind of leader Sharaa will shape up to be in the coming months, and years.

None of that deters Aljamous.

""When the regime was in control,"" he says of the former authoritarian Assad government, ""I would have followed the devil if it meant overthrowing them. They were worse than the devil.""

He's ready to give Sharaa a chance.

But when asked about specifics, he admits he doesn't have any set plans yet for his return.

He looks down at his feet, and quietly reveals his biggest fear — going back to a country he barely recognizes.

""Sometimes, I just sit and try to think who's left [in Syria] — literally no one from my friends. I don't know anyone there. So if I go back, I think it's going to be a big problem for me,"" he says.

Bushra and Hasan. Surviving the revolution, but living with ghosts

In a different corner of Gaziantep, a couple is navigating similar questions, with memories shaped by war, and a relationship forged in the fight against it.

Bushra Ajaj and Hasan Ajam, both 35, met in the early days of the uprising.

She was a university student organizing protests. He was part of the same underground network. They shared a mission and, eventually, a life.

""We met through the revolution,"" Ajaj says, smiling. ""We survived it together.""

Today, they live in Gaziantep with their two young children. The new Syrian flag hangs in their living room — a symbol of both pride and pain.

Both were arrested for their activism. Both lost friends and family. They fled Syria more than a decade ago, and have each returned briefly since Assad's fall.

Neither one recognized the country they left.

""I visited Syria twice,"" Ajam says. ""But I haven't stepped inside my old house.""

Today, Ajam works with the Caesar Families Association, a group seeking justice for those who disappeared in regime prisons in Syria. The group is named after a forensic photographer, known by the pseudonym Caesar, who smuggled out more than 55,000 photos documenting torture and death before fleeing to the U.S. in 2013.

Five years ago, Ajam identified his brother's body in one of those photos — confirmation of what his family had long feared. Now, he's determined to return to Syria to find the place where his brother was buried.

For Bushra Ajaj, returning in April meant facing ghosts of her own. Her family home was in ruins. But what shattered her most was seeing her university again — the site of so many protests, and of her best friend's death

""I cried so much,"" she says. ""The memories just came back.""

Their children, born in Turkey, speak Turkish more fluently than Arabic.

""Sometimes I think it's good,"" Ajaj says. ""They feel at home here."" But the thought of moving to Syria raises new fears. ""What if they feel like strangers there?""

If they ever go back for good, Ajaj hopes it won't be to her tiny, damaged village. Maybe it would be the city of Aleppo, in northwestern Syria. Maybe somewhere new. Somewhere they can build fresh memories.

Ahmad al-Taleb: Betting everything on Aleppo

One man who's already made his decision is Ahmad al-Taleb.

A 33-year-old civil engineer — and part-time party clown — from Aleppo, Taleb fled Syria in 2014 after ISIS took over his city.

At the time, he was documenting human rights violations, work that put him and his family at risk. His brother was arrested. Taleb fled to Turkey.

Since then, he's built a life in Gaziantep — studied, married, launched a company, and became a father.

But in October, when his lease is up, he and his wife Sahar, along with their 3-year-old son Kamal, will pack their things and return to Aleppo for good.

""I feel much safer now,"" Taleb says, sipping juice made from oranges his mother picked in Latakia, along Syria's Mediterranean coast. ""I'm afraid, of course. But I'm also optimistic. It's time to rebuild.""

Taleb is under no illusions. Aleppo is still in ruins. Rents are soaring. Services are patchy.

Sahar, who never finished university, hopes to resume her studies, but there's no guarantee she'll be able to.

""Still,"" Taleb says, ""we belong to Syria. Turkey is our second home, but it's not where we belong.""

He remembers the euphoria of Assad's fall last year, which he and Sahar watched unfold from their couch into the early hours of the night. Feeling restless watching the celebrations unfold in Damascus on their TV screen, Taleb got in his car and drove straight to the capital city.

When he got there, he was overcome with a mix of jubilation and agony.

Memories came flooding back of the massacres he documented. Friends lost. Airstrikes he saw kill innocent women and children.

""It was a mix of feelings. Victory and grief.""

Armed with a big smile, Taleb says he's keeping a positive mind about the future. He believes in the promise of the transitional government, and in his role as a civil engineer in rebuilding Syria.

""I just hope my son never asks me, 'Why did you take us back?'"" he says. ""But if he grows up where he belongs, maybe one day he'll understand.""

Mohammed Jamil Alshammary. Home is calling — but is his family ready?

On the eve of a trip to Damascus, Mohammed Jamil Alshammary is practically giddy — reciting couplets aloud.

""Like up high in the glorious skies, my angel's heart shyly lies. To her so sweet, celestial sound brought me down to the ground.""

At 44, Alshammary is a seasoned interpreter and literature buff who's worked in boardrooms from Geneva to Paris, translating for presidents and humanitarian leaders alike.

He quotes the linguist Noam Chomsky, references the movie The Hours, and casually drops George Michael lyrics into the conversation.

Despite job offers in Canada and Europe, he chose to stay in Turkey for the past 15 years for his family.

""My wife didn't want our daughters raised in a foreign culture,"" he says. ""Turkey felt closer to home.""

Now, Alshammary says he's ready to help rebuild Syria, albeit cautiously.

""Security first. Then economy,"" he says. ""Even if I were paid $1,000 a day in Damascus — if it's not safe, I won't bring my family there.""

Alshammary knows the challenges that await him. Rents in Damascus have skyrocketed because of housing shortages. His children, fluent in Turkish, risk cultural displacement if they return.

""I'm middle class,"" he says. ""What about the rest? Most Syrians can't afford rent or tuition.""

Still, he says he's ready to bring one foot back into Syria, where he hopes to open a translation agency in Damascus.

""We must not clone the past,"" he says. ""No more corruption. No more exclusion.""

So far this year, more than 1.4 million people have returned or been forced to return to Afghanistan, including over 1 million from Iran.

Iran and Pakistan in 2023 launched separate campaigns to expel foreigners they said were living in the country illegally. They set deadlines and threatened them with deportation if they didn’t leave. The two governments deny targeting Afghans, who have fled their homeland over the decades to escape war, poverty or Taliban rule.

The U.N. special representative for Afghanistan, Roza Otunbayeva, called for immediate international support for Afghanistan following a visit to the Islam Qala border crossing in western Herat province near Iran.

The “sheer volume of returns —many abrupt, many involuntary,” should be setting off alarm bells across the global community, Otunbayeva said.

“Without swift interventions, remittance losses, labor market pressures and cyclical migration will lead to devastating consequences such as the further destabilization of both returnee and host populations, renewed displacement, mass onward movement, and risks to regional stability,” she said.

Returns from Iran peaked in June following a 20 March government deadline requiring all “undocumented” Afghans to leave. The U.N. migration agency recorded more than 28,000 people crossing back into Afghanistan on June 25.

Afghanistan is a ‘forgotten crisis’

Most Afghans depend on humanitarian assistance to survive. But deep funding cuts are worsening the situation, with aid agencies and nongovernmental organizations forced to cut education and health care programs.

Nicole van Batenburg, from the International Federation of the Red Cross, said Afghan children returning from Iran are developing scabies, fever and other illnesses because of deteriorating conditions at the border and the hot weather. Her colleagues were reuniting hundreds of children daily who got separated from their parents.

People lost their belongings and documents in the chaos of hasty exits. Most were only able to take a few suitcases with them, and some were now using their luggage as makeshift furniture.

“Afghanistan is an unseen crisis, and there are so many crises going on at this moment in the world that it seems to be forgotten,” van Batenburg told The Associated Press by phone from the border.

“The problems and the challenges are immense. We’re only talking about the situation here at the border, but these people have to return to some areas where they can live longer and where they can rebuild their lives.”

Last week, the Norwegian Refugee Council said many of its staff were hosting returning families in their homes. Authorities were doing their best to mobilize the few resources they had, but local systems were not equipped to cope with “such tremendous” needs.

The U.S. Supreme Court ruled yesterday that it will allow the Trump administration to resume dismantling the U.S. Department of Education. The Court overruled a lower court that temporarily paused massive cuts at the department. Congress created the department by law and President Trump promised to shut it down without any change in that law, which is why opponents sued.

🎧 The court's decision now means that roughly 1,400 Education Department workers will lose their jobs, NPR's Cory Turner tells Up First. The work that those employees did, including helping local schools support kids with disabilities and children living in poverty, may also cease. The ruling isn't the final word as the case continues to work its way through lower courts. The plaintiffs' concern is that by the time they get a final ruling in court, it might not matter, as the harm to the department could be irreversible, Turner stated.

Some Trump supporters over the weekend were surprised when he urged them to move on from the Epstein files. The Justice Department and the FBI released a two-page memo last week stating they found no evidence to support conspiracy theories about the life and death of disgraced financier and convicted sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein. They stated he really did kill himself in jail in 2019 and left no client list. This comes after Attorney General Pam Bondi previously said on Fox News that she had the list on her desk.

🎧 Heading into the last election, a central concept of Trump's MAGA ideology was the belief that there was a deep state cabal of shadowy figures protecting pedophiles and unsavory people running the government and obstructing Trump's agenda, says NPR's Stephen Fowler. Now, Trump has a baseless theory about the files, suggesting Democrats created them to target him. Fowler says it is uncertain if Trump's shift on the topic has hurt his favorability with his supporters, but it does reiterate the stranglehold the president has on the shape and direction of the GOP.

Trump yesterday threatened to implement heavy tariffs on countries that trade with Moscow if the Kremlin doesn't reach a ceasefire deal with Ukraine by September. The president also promised Ukraine billions of dollars worth of U.S.-made military equipment, which NATO countries in Europe will pay for.



🎧 NPR's Charles Maynes says the president's change of tone on Russia was quite a shift. A big driver in this shift is Trump's frustration with and even a sense of betrayal by Russian President Vladimir Putin. The president said he thought he had a peace deal with Putin four separate times, only to see Russian attacks in Ukraine continue. Some in Moscow see the 50-day grace period provided for the ceasefire as a sign that Trump isn't ready to give up on Russia.

Living Better is a special series about what it takes to stay healthy in America.

Doctors are writing ""social prescriptions"" to get people engaged with nature, art, exercise and volunteering in the same way they would prescribe pills or therapy. Research has shown it can help with mental health, chronic disease and dementia. The method worked for Frank Frost. He gained weight and was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes in his 50s. A doctor found out he used to love riding a bike as a kid and gave him a prescription for a 10-week cycling course for adults getting back into cycling. The prescription led to Frost developing friends, losing 100 pounds and getting his diabetes under control. Julia Hotz, the author of The Connection Cure: The Prescriptive Power of Movement, Nature, Art, Service, and Belonging, shares details on the health approach:



🚲 Health providers in around 30 countries are practicing social prescribing to address symptoms of Type 2 diabetes, chronic pain, dementia, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety and depression, and more. A growing number of U.S. providers are also embracing the approach.

🚲 Social prescribing can save money due to a reduction in emergency room visits and repeat visits to primary care physicians. Health care systems have acknowledged that it can be cheaper to cover weeks of Zumba classes than medication over the course of a lifetime.

🚲 People interested in social prescribing can visit the map on Social Prescribing USA's website to find a list of organizations and health systems involved in this practice.

281,88,Medicaid was signed into law 60 years ago. Trump's tax cuts law chisels away at it,https://globegazette.com/life-entertainment/nation-world/wellness/article_8b0f03d4-9e51-5e8c-8527-11e907ed0e35.html,31/07/2025 11:30,globegazette,GB,immigration,"WASHINGTON — On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed legislation that launched Medicaid, creating a U.S. health care safety net for millions of low-income Americans — a crowning achievement of his domestic legacy.

A year earlier, he did the same for food stamps, drawing on President John F. Kennedy's first executive order for the development of ""a positive food and nutrition program for all Americans.""

This summer, President Donald Trump began to chisel away at the programs.

The Republican Party's big tax and spending law delivered not just $4.5 trillion in tax breaks for Americans but some of the most substantial changes to the landmark safety net programs in their history. The trade-off will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from federal health care and food assistance, largely by imposing work requirements on those receiving aid and by shifting certain federal costs onto the states.

While Republicans argue the trims are needed to rightsize the federal programs that grew over the decades and prevent rising federal deficits, they also seek to shrink the federal government and the services it provides.

""We're making the first changes to the welfare state in generations,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a recent podcast interview.

As the tax breaks and spending cuts law begins to take shape, it is unleashing a new era of uncertainty for the safety net programs that millions of people in communities across the nation have grown to depend on, with political ramifications to come.

Big safety net changes ahead

Polling shows most U.S. adults don't think the government is overspending on the programs. Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Local governments are scrambling to figure out how they will comply with the new landscape, calculating whether they will need to raise their own taxes to cover costs, trim budgets elsewhere or cut back aid.

""The cuts are really big, they are really broad and they are deeply damaging,"" said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute in Washington.

""The consequences are millions of people losing health care coverage,"" she said. ""Millions of people losing food assistance. And the net result of that is higher poverty, more hardship.""

At the same time, certain people who receive aid — including parents of teenagers and older Americans up to age 64 — will have to work, take classes or do community service for 80 hours a month to meet new requirements.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 10 million more people will end up without health insurance. About 3 million fewer people will participate in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP.

""People are really concerned what this means for their fiscal health,"" said Mark Ritacco, chief governmental affairs officer at the National Association of Counties, which held its annual conference the week after Trump signed the bill.

The organization pushed senators to delay the start dates for some Medicaid changes, and it hopes further conversations with lawmakers in Congress can prevent some of them from ever taking hold.

""We're talking about Medicaid and SNAP — these are people's lives and livelihoods,"" Ritacco said.

GOP cuts health care, food aid

Medicaid then and now

When President Johnson established Medicaid alongside Medicare, the health care program for seniors, as part of the Social Security Amendments of 1965, it was meant for low-income families as well as the disabled.

Nearly every state signed on to participate in Medicaid by 1970, according to KFF, an organization focused on health policy. The program soon expanded to include pregnant women, school-age children and not just the very poor but also those with incomes just over the federal poverty limit, which is now about $15,650 annually for a single person and $26,650 for a family of three.

In the 15 years since the Affordable Care Act became law under President Barack Obama, Medicaid grew substantially as most states opted to join the federal expansion. About 80 million adults and children are covered.

While the uninsured population tumbled, the federal costs of providing Medicaid soared — to more than $880 billion a year.

""There are a lot of effects Medicaid has on health, but the most stark thing that it does is that it saves lives,"" said Bruce D. Meyer, an economist and public policy professor at the University of Chicago who co-authored a pivotal study assessing the program.

The law's changes will save the federal government ""a substantial amount of money,"" he said, but that will come at ""substantial increases in mortality. And you have to decide what you value more.""

Food stamps, which were offered toward the end of the Great Depression but halted during World War II amid rationed supplies, launched as a federal program when Johnson signed the Food Stamp Act of 1964 into law.

Today, SNAP provides almost $200 in monthly benefits per person to about 40 million recipients nationwide.

Johnson signed legislation that launched Medicaid, creating a U.S. health care safety net for millions of low-income Americans — a crowning achievement of his domestic legacy.

A year earlier, he did the same for food stamps, drawing on President John F. Kennedy's first executive order for the development of ""a positive food and nutrition program for all Americans.""

This summer, President Donald Trump began to chisel away at the programs.

The Republican Party's big tax and spending law delivered not just $4.5 trillion in tax breaks for Americans but some of the most substantial changes to the landmark safety net programs in their history. The trade-off will cut more than $1 trillion over a decade from federal health care and food assistance, largely by imposing work requirements on those receiving aid and by shifting certain federal costs onto the states.

While Republicans argue the trims are needed to rightsize the federal programs that grew over the decades and prevent rising federal deficits, they also seek to shrink the federal government and the services it provides.

""We're making the first changes to the welfare state in generations,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said in a recent podcast interview.

As the tax breaks and spending cuts law begins to take shape, it is unleashing a new era of uncertainty for the safety net programs that millions of people in communities across the nation have grown to depend on, with political ramifications to come.

Big safety net changes ahead

Polling shows most U.S. adults don't think the government is overspending on the programs. Americans broadly support increasing or maintaining existing levels of funding for popular safety net programs, including Social Security and Medicare, according to the poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

Local governments are scrambling to figure out how they will comply with the new landscape, calculating whether they will need to raise their own taxes to cover costs, trim budgets elsewhere or cut back aid.

""The cuts are really big, they are really broad and they are deeply damaging,"" said Sharon Parrott, president of the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a research institute in Washington.

""The consequences are millions of people losing health care coverage,"" she said. ""Millions of people losing food assistance. And the net result of that is higher poverty, more hardship.""

At the same time, certain people who receive aid — including parents of teenagers and older Americans up to age 64 — will have to work, take classes or do community service for 80 hours a month to meet new requirements.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates 10 million more people will end up without health insurance. About 3 million fewer people will participate in the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program, known as SNAP.

""People are really concerned what this means for their fiscal health,"" said Mark Ritacco, chief governmental affairs officer at the National Association of Counties, which held its annual conference the week after Trump signed the bill.

The organization pushed senators to delay the start dates for some Medicaid changes, and it hopes further conversations with lawmakers in Congress can prevent some of them from ever taking hold.

""We're talking about Medicaid and SNAP — these are people's lives and livelihoods,"" Ritacco said.

The organization, known for its ongoing efforts to empower workers in factories, farms, mines, and informal sectors such as domestic help and home-based work, brought together survivors, stakeholders, and civil society representatives to address the urgent need for stronger action against human trafficking.

The awareness-raising event also served as a platform for victims of human trafficking to share their painful experiences. With tears in their eyes, community members narrated harrowing stories of exploitation, deceit, and abuse—offering a raw and honest glimpse into the human cost of trafficking. Their stories highlighted the continued vulnerability of economically marginalized populations, especially those from rural and underdeveloped areas, to trafficking networks that lure people with false promises of employment abroad.

The forum emphasized that despite the presence of laws and the activeness of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), trafficking continues at an alarming scale. Participants stressed the need to review existing legislation to determine why it is not being effectively implemented. They called for a comprehensive migration policy that includes regularization procedures and protection mechanisms for those leaving the country for work. Speakers also criticized the lack of effective enforcement and coordination by the Government of Pakistan and its embassies abroad.

The panellists urged the government to expand employment opportunities within Pakistan, ensure social protection for vulnerable workers, strengthen the role of embassies and the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis, and adopt multi-sectoral, preventive measures to tackle human trafficking.

Mahnaz Rahman, President of NOWCommunities and a renowned women's rights activist, said that marginalized communities continue to suffer due to a lack of access to basic rights and services. “The government must initiate a five-year development plan focused on job creation. Private organizations should also come forward to support their workers with education and health facilities. Urban reforms must be introduced alongside agricultural reforms,” she stressed.

Farhat Parveen, Executive Director of NOWCommunities and member of the UNODC Civil Society Unit from Pakistan, raised grave concerns over the growing trend of illegal migration. “People are being trafficked from Balochistan to Iran, and then to Turkey and beyond. A significant number are also being trafficked to the UAE. Many areas in Punjab have become trafficking hubs,” she stated.

Saeed Baloch of Pakistan Fisherfolk Forum (PFF) noted that people don’t just migrate for employment—they leave in search of dignity, stability, and a better life. “In their own country, they don’t feel safe, secure, or hopeful for a better future,” he said.

Bushra Arain, Chairperson of the All Lady Health Workers Union, along with community stakeholders, lady health workers, and labour representatives, emphasized the importance of grassroots mobilization, gender-sensitive interventions, and institutional accountability in combating trafficking.

The event concluded with a renewed commitment to building stronger networks among community groups, civil society, and policymakers to combat human trafficking and safeguard the rights and dignity of all migrant workers.",NewsData.io,,,not found,,,,"News HD 24, newshd24, 24 News HD",not found,https://ground.news/interest/24-news-hd,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,24newshd.tv,,newshd24,225,UK,,,,

Kolkata: Trinamool Congress general secretary and the party’s Lok Sabha member, Abhishek Banerjee, has convened a crucial virtual meeting on August 8 to finalise the party’s blueprint on two crucial issues.

The first issue is on how to organise mass movements against the proposed Special Intensive Review (SIR) of voters’ list in West Bengal by the Election Commission of India (ECI).

SIR has already been described by the Trinamool Congress leadership as the BJP’s ploy to delete names of genuine voters in West Bengal from the list and thus slap the NRC in the state indirectly.

The second issue, party insiders said, is to work out a strategy on how to spread the party’s scheduled movement on the issue of harassment of Bengali-speaking migrants in BJP-ruled states beyond the borders of West Bengal to other Indian states.

“The meeting will start from 4 P.M. on Wednesday and will be attended by all elected party MPs, legislators, heads of municipal corporations, municipalities and panchayat bodies, all members of the party’s state committee, chiefs of the party-affiliated mass organisations and all the district presidents and chairmen of the party,” confirmed a member of the West Bengal Cabinet.

Notes have already been issued to those who are supposed to be present at the virtual meeting, the Cabinet member added.

It is learnt that while SIR and Bengali-speaking migrant harassment would be the two main issues to be discussed in the August 8 meeting, there are possibilities of discussion on some internal organisational matters surfacing in the course of the meeting.

On Wednesday, Abhishek Banerjee accused the Centre’s ruling BJP of using the ECI to snatch away voting rights of a large number of people, and he also dubbed the poll-panel-initiated SIR as “Silent Invisible Rigging”.

He also claimed that the BJP got scared of the people’s mandate and that is why they resorted to such tactics to turn elections in their favour.

The statement from Banerjee came amid concerns that the Election Commission is planning to conduct a SIR of the voters’ list of West Bengal ahead of the 2026 Assembly polls.

The ECI recently concluded a SIR of the voters’ list in neighbouring Bihar, where more than 60 lakh people were described as doubtful voters.",NewsData.io,,,not found,,,,"munsifdaily, The Munsif Daily",not found,https://ground.news/interest/the-munsif-daily_381de1,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,munsifdaily.com,,munsifdaily,224,UK,,,,

MDP Wethersfield in Essex has been home to hundreds of single male asylum seekers since July 2023.

There are about 800 men at the accommodation, but as of Thursday (31 July), Braintree District Council expects this to begin rising to 1,245.

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""All use of property or sites under our ownership is carried out in accordance with relevant planning permissions.""

The council expects an increase of 60 new arrivals each week.

Wethersfield houses more asylum seekers than any other location in the UK.

Only single adult males are housed at MDP Wethersfield, and most have arrived by boat.

In a letter to people who live near the base in north Essex, the Home Office said: ""The contingency bed spaces will only be utilised on a temporary basis until such time as the wider accommodation estate is able to manage demand.""

Braintree council expects numbers to start reducing back to 800 in October.

The local authority's Conservative leader, Graham Butland, said the government was sending more asylum seekers to Wethersfield ""due to record small boat arrivals"".

The Home Office says it has halved the use of hotels to house asylum seekers since 2023, from more than 400 to fewer than 210.

The former Tory home secretary and Braintree MP James Cleverly told the BBC earlier this year that using hotels would be better and cheaper than the military site in his constituency. His former department refuted this.

Asylum seekers have been staying at Wethersfield for an average of 81 days before moving elsewhere in the UK. There have been protests and fights by migrants at the site.

Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman was found to have acted unlawfully by accommodating three asylum seekers there, and some charities have described conditions as ""prison-like"".

Butland, whose council has opposed to use of the base because of its rural location, said: ""We will continue to monitor the situation and hold the Home Office to account to ensure that the site runs safely alongside the local community.""

A Home Office spokesperson added: ""We work together with local authorities and other stakeholders to ensure the accommodation estate is continuously reviewed and managed safely and effectively at all times.""

Supplied Some asylum seekers at the base have protested over conditions at the former RAF station

Only single adult males are housed at MDP Wethersfield, and most have arrived by boat. In a letter to people who live near the base in north Essex, the Home Office said: ""The contingency bed spaces will only be utilised on a temporary basis until such time as the wider accommodation estate is able to manage demand."" Braintree council expects numbers to start reducing back to 800 in October. The local authority's Conservative leader, Graham Butland, said the government was sending more asylum seekers to Wethersfield ""due to record small boat arrivals"". The Home Office says it has halved the use of hotels to house asylum seekers since 2023, from more than 400 to fewer than 210.

The former Tory home secretary and Braintree MP James Cleverly told the BBC earlier this year that using hotels would be better and cheaper than the military site in his constituency. His former department refuted this. Asylum seekers have been staying at Wethersfield for an average of 81 days before moving elsewhere in the UK. There have been protests and fights by migrants at the site. Former Home Secretary Suella Braverman was found to have acted unlawfully by accommodating three asylum seekers there, and some charities have described conditions as ""prison-like"". Butland, whose council has opposed the use of the base because of its rural location, said: ""We will continue to monitor the situation and hold the Home Office to account to ensure that the site runs safely alongside the local community."" A Home Office spokesperson added: ""We work together with local authorities and other stakeholders to ensure the accommodation estate is continuously reviewed and managed safely and effectively at all times.""

292,260,‘Welcome to hell’: Inside the megaprison where the U.S. deported migrants,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/07/31/venezuelans-deported-us-el-salvador-prison-cecot/,31/07/2025 11:23,washingtonpost,GB,migrant,"Leer en español One detainee was beaten unconscious. Others emerged from the dark isolation room covered in bruises, struggling to walk or vomiting blood. Another returned to his cell in tears, telling fellow detainees he’d just been sexually assaulted. “Let’s hit him like a piñata,” guards shouted amid the beatings, detainees recalled, the blows echoing against the metal walls.

They called it “La Isla” — The Island — the cell where Venezuelans deported from the United States by the Trump administration said they suffered some of the worst abuse of their 125 days in El Salvador’s Terrorism Confinement Center, or CECOT.

The matching firsthand accounts across multiple interviews offer the most complete view yet of conditions inside the megaprison, where inmates are denied access to lawyers and almost all contact with the outside world — and where about 14,000 Salvadorans remain incarcerated. Few detainees have ever left CECOT, and fewer have spoken publicly of their experience there.

The Washington Post interviewed 16 of the more than 250 men who were deported by the United States to CECOT, held there for four months and then released this month to Venezuela as part of an international prisoner swap.

The Venezuelans, rounded up in President Donald Trump’s mass deportation campaign, told The Post they were subjected to repeated beatings that left them bruised, bleeding or injured. They said prison staff restricted medical care for detainees suffering from diabetes, high blood pressure or kidney failure.

The men slept on metal bunks — usually with no cushions — in group cells where overhead lights blazed 24 hours a day. They were expected to bathe and relieve themselves using a water tank and toilets that offered no privacy from cellmates. They were rarely allowed out of their cells.

Three Salvadoran government spokespersons, provided with detailed accounts of the detainees’ allegations, did not respond to requests for comment. Damian Merlo, a U.S.-based lobbyist for Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, described the detainees as criminals who belong in prison, and said their claims are “baseless.”

“Additionally, footage made available on social media of their departure from El Salvador showed them in good spirits,” Merlo said, “happily … heading back home to Venezuela.”

Tricia McLaughlin, a spokeswoman for the Department of Homeland Security, provided a statement that repeated administration claims that the detainees were members of the Tren de Aragua gang — though government officials have acknowledged in court that many of those sent to CECOT had no criminal record.

Robert L. Cerna, an acting field office director at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said in a court filing in March that the “lack of a criminal record does not indicate they pose a limited threat” and that the limited information about each individual “actually highlights the risk they pose.”

“President Trump and [DHS] Secretary [Kristi L.] Noem will not allow criminal gangs to terrorize American citizens,” McLaughlin said. “Once again the media is falling all over themselves to defend criminal illegal gang members. We hear far too much about gang members and criminals’ false sob stories and not enough about their victims.”

Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman, said the Trump administration is grateful for its partnership with Bukele “to help remove the worst of the worst illegal criminals, terrorists, and gang members from the United States.” She deferred questions about specific allegations to El Salvador’s government.

If the detainees’ accounts are true, their treatment at CECOT may have violated U.N. conventions against torture to which El Salvador and the U.S. are signatories, said Isabel Carlota Roby, a senior staff attorney at the Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights organization who has spoken with some of the detainees. Whether the U.S., which paid Bukele’s government $6 million to hold the Venezuelans, could be implicated in human rights violations would depend on the evidence, Roby said, including how much U.S. officials knew about the conditions.

Torture, arbitrary detentions, forced disappearances and sexual assault, if proved to be systematic or generalized and known to the government, can all constitute crimes against humanity. An international panel is preparing a report on El Salvador and investigating whether any of those crimes were committed. At least one member of the panel thinks a criminal investigation is warranted.

“Based on the information I have reviewed,” said Santiago Canton, secretary general of the International Commission of Jurists, “there are reasonable grounds for an investigation by the International Criminal Court.”

The Post has found that many of the detainees had entered the United States legally and were actively complying with U.S. immigration rules.

Many of the men had fled political oppression and extreme poverty under Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, a U.S. adversary. Some had been granted permission to live and work in the United States. At least two arrived in the U.S. as refugees seeking safety from persecution in Venezuela.

As the detained men were shuttled onto flights in Texas on March 15, none were told where they were being taken.

‘We’re giving you a surprise’

Shackled at their wrists, waists and ankles, the migrants were loaded onto three GlobalX charter planes, with many of them believing they were headed to Venezuela. At least they would be going home, Basulto thought. They were prohibited from opening the window shades. “We’re giving you a surprise,” he remembers one immigration official telling them.

When they landed, Basulto said, he found the courage to peek out the window. He saw El Salvador’s blue-and-white flag waving in the air. Detainees began to panic, he said. A female deportee who spoke English read aloud from one of the documents she’d been given. She translated for the rest of the passengers: They would be detained for at least a year in El Salvador.

Some migrants refused to get off the plane. A guard struck a female passenger, Basulto said. Screams filled the plane. Eventually, Basulto and other detainees said, they were kicked, shoved, beaten and forced off. Two Salvadoran officers grabbed his arms.

“Throw them down!” officers yelled, as detainees were pummeled and dragged to buses, according to detainee Miguel Rojas Mendoza. He recounted watching one man get slammed so hard against a bus that his face began gushing blood.

Molina, the refugee who had been vetted for resettlement in the U.S., begged officers for an explanation.

“Please, I don’t understand what I’m doing here,” Molina said. “I haven’t committed any crime. Please, let me talk to someone.” He began to pray. Then a Salvadoran officer grabbed him by the neck.

“Run, son of a b----,” he commanded, according to Molina, and jammed a rifle into his ribs.

Hernández, the makeup artist, watched as the women were turned around and put on a flight back to the United States. The Salvadorans, he said, refused to accept them. The buses now filled with men began rolling.

“Welcome to El Salvador,” hooded officers shouted on the ride, six detainees said. “Welcome to hell.”

At CECOT, Basulto said, guards shaved his head, stripped him of his clothes and took his phone, $700 in cash and the gold pendant he wore for luck.

Hernández cried out for his mother. “Why are you shaving my head?” he asked. “I’m a makeup stylist, I’m gay, I’m not a gang member.”

The men were pushed together in a warehouse, flanked by photographers and guards, and forced to kneel. They were addressed by the prison director.

Here, the director said, the men would have no rights — no right to a lawyer, no access to the sun. They would not eat chicken or meat for the rest of their lives.

“The only way that you will leave,” he said, according to multiple detainees, “is inside a black bag.”

‘The most perverse form of humiliation’

CECOT, opened by Bukele in 2023 as part of his crackdown on Salvadoran gangs, was designed to terrify the most violent of criminals. His government hailed it as the largest prison in the Americas, initially announcing a capacity for 20,000 detainees and later doubling it. The imposing fortress outside San Salvador sprawls across more than 280 acres, surrounded by an electrified perimeter fence and 19 watchtowers. The roof of each pavilion is made of diamond-shaped mesh with sharp edges.

The Venezuelans were placed in cells, up to 20 men in each. The concrete walls showed sweat stains, drops of dried blood and what appeared to be scratches from human nails, one detainee recalled.

Each cell held 80 metal beds stacked closely together in tiers of four, according to detainees and images of CECOT previously shared by Bukele’s government. Use of the water tanks and toilets was controlled by the guards and restricted to certain times of day. With no windows or fans, the detainees lived and ate amid the stench of their own sewage.

The detainees could gauge the time only by the heat that made them sweat during the day and the cold that chilled their metal beds at night. They couldn’t see the sun, they said, but sometimes could hear the rain.

CECOT “seemed like it was for animals,” said detainee Julio Fernández Sánchez, 35. “It was designed for people to go crazy or kill themselves.”

Basulto said detainees were occasionally allowed to leave their cells to play soccer for 20 minutes or attend a brief Bible reading, but time dragged. The men in one cell counted the days by scratching marks into a wall.

Detainees with medical concerns were often housed in Cell No. 8, said Fernández, who was held there after an injury to his shoulder during a beating. There were men suffering from diabetes, skin problems and panic attacks. One day a diabetic prisoner was given the wrong insulin and began convulsing after it was injected, Fernández recalled. Guards took nearly half an hour to get him help.

“The doctor would watch us get beaten and then ask us ‘How are you feeling?’ with a smile,” Basulto said. “It was the most perverse form of humiliation.”

When Tito Martínez, 26, was in immigration detention in the U.S., he said, a doctor told him he had kidney failure and would need a transplant. After repeated beatings in CECOT, Martínez said he could no longer get out of bed. He would wet himself, and he relied on his cellmates to feed him.

“Tito is dying,” his friends told prison staff. When he was finally treated, Martínez said, the doctor told him that his functioning kidney was operating at only 20 percent and that he would soon need dialysis to survive.

Some detainees attempted suicide by tying sheets around their necks or using rusted pipes to cut their veins.

Disobeying rules proved costly. When Hernández’s head ached from the heat, he tried to cool down by bathing. He forgot to tell his friends to watch for guards.

“Get up, piece of sh--,” an officer told him, he said. He was taken to La Isla, where a tiny hole in the ceiling provided only a needle of light and almost no air.

Four men entered and began touching him with their clubs and putting them between his legs. One forced Hernández to perform oral sex on him, he said.

Basulto said Hernández returned to the cell in tears and told him what had happened. He and other detainees offered to speak up to the prison staff, but he urged them not to. He feared it would provoke officers to “attack us even more.”

‘The locks will break’

After weeks of daily beatings, detainees said, they launched a hunger strike. They went four days without food or water.

“People started fainting. Falling to the floor,” said detainee Mervin Yamarte, 29. The guards “laughed.”

When the hunger strike failed to draw attention, some used shards from metal pipes to slice their skin and write messages on their sheets in blood: “We are not terrorists, we are migrants.”

“We wanted them to see we were willing to die,” said Neiyerver Adrián León Rengel, 27.

The men grew desperate. About two months after arriving at CECOT, detainees tore rails off bunks and used them to break their locks. Dozens broke free and hurled soap and juice cartons at guards. Some broke cement off the walls to throw at them.

The guards fired back with rubber bullets, stormed the cells and forced men to kneel with their hands behind their heads.

“They stood on our legs until we couldn’t feel them anymore,” León Rengel said.

Then came their punishment: They were taken to La Isla. Molina said he sometimes heard screams echoing into his cell for hours at a time.

The next day, he said, guards lined up the handcuffed detainees and took turns beating them.

They broke a tooth of one man and dislocated an arm of another, Molina said. “That [day] was the worst of the beatings.”

Conditions improved only when outsiders visited the prison or when government officials wanted photographs, multiple detainees said. Shortly after a Red Cross visit, Bibles were handed out to each cell.

For a visit by DHS’s Noem, the detainees were given better food and even mattresses, though thin. When a group of U.S. politicians toured the prison, Basulto said, detainees with visible injuries were moved to the remotest cells. After detainees began singing the Venezuelan national anthem, Basulto said, the prison director “quickly cut the politicians’ visit short and hurried them away.”

The Red Cross, which visits Salvadoran prisons regularly, appeared at CECOT twice during the Venezuelans’ time there. Delegates met with the men and collected brief spoken messages for their families, according to Martina Ferraris, deputy protection coordinator for the International Committee of the Red Cross mission in El Salvador. These were vetted by prison staff, Ferraris said.

In their final days in CECOT, detainees said, conditions seemed to improve. Molina was taken to the doctor for an evaluation. He was given a clean shave and the haircut of his choice.

The detainees were given Colgate toothpaste, a Gillette razor and deodorant. A prison official took photos. The director told them to brush their teeth.

At 5 a.m. on July 18, they were loaded onto buses, unsure where they were headed. Then a man in a uniform with a Venezuelan flag on one sleeve stepped onto Molina’s bus. They were going home.

On the plane, the Venezuelans sang a Christian song — with new words.

“If I had faith as small as a mustard seed, I would tell my brothers, ‘We’re leaving. We’re leaving. We’re leaving!’” they sang. “And the locks will break.”

Men dressed in black waited for the detainees on a plane set to fly to Venezuela. Detainees would later learn that Maduro had sent officers of the SEBIN, his feared secret police, usually used to detain or disappear his political opponents.

Before being reunited with their families, one detainee said, they were told to record a video thanking the Venezuelan government. He said he was warned that if he fled again and was deported back, he could be charged with treason. The detainee spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of retribution from the Maduro government.

Several of the men, who had once fled the authoritarian country, said they were genuinely grateful to Maduro for negotiating their release when it seemed no one else would. Still, some said they’d leave for the U.S. again, perhaps once Trump leaves office.

Not Molina. He doesn’t think he could do it again, he said, “having lived through that.”

296,92,"“All through our career, every time we would play that song, I would feel that rush of adrenaline, as if it was the first time I heard it.” Mike Campbell on the Tom Petty song that stunned him at ever",https://www.guitarplayer.com/guitarists/mike-campbell-the-tom-petty-song-that-stunned-him-at-every-show,31/07/2025 11:26,guitarplayer,GB,refugee,"“It’s hard to describe to someone who hasn’t stood on that stage and felt that love from that many people rushing over you,” Mike Campbell says. “It’s like a wave knocking you off. It’s a magical thing that you can’t really get anywhere else in life. It’s a buzz, a high, a spiritual joy.

“And that’s why we kept doing it — because there’s nothing like it.”

For most of his career, Campbell has felt that rush while performing onstage with Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, where he served as lead guitarist until Petty’s death on October 2, 2017. Given that group’s deep, multi-decade catalog, Campbell would experience the audience’s intense reaction to their music time and again over the course of a single night’s performance.

But there is one song that stands out from the rest for him — a favorite tune that was ""a dream come true"" for audiences to hear every night. And it was one of the group’s very first tunes: “American Girl.”

“A lot of songs come to mind,” Campbell tells Under the Radar about the tunes that move him. “But I guess the most important one right now, in my mind, is ‘American Girl,’ which is one of our first songs.

“All through our career, every time we would play that song, I would feel that rush of adrenaline. As if it was the first time I heard it. It always had this power to it. It connected with people.”

As it did when Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers performed “American Girl” at what would be their final show, at the Hollywood Bowl, on September 25, 2017, the last stop on their 40th-anniversary tour. In his recently published memoir, Heartbreaker, Campbell recalls the audience emotionally singing along with every song at the show.

“And that night at the Hollywood Bowl, that was the last song we played, and I felt it then,” Campbell says.

“So did Tom.”

American Girl - YouTube Watch On

Composed by Petty and recorded on July 4, 1976 — America’s bicentennial anniversary — “American Girl” was the band’s third single off its self-titled debut album.

Campbell says the song moved him when he first heard it. Notably, it was among the initial tunes he recorded with the Heartbreakers using the rare 1950 Fender Broadcaster electric guitar he purchased — along with a blackface Fender Deluxe Reverb combo — for $600 shortly before the album’s sessions.

But he also recalls another song that took longer to become one of his favorites: “Refugee.” A Petty and Campbell co-write, “Refugee” proved difficult to record when the band tracked it for their third album, 1979’s Damn the Torpedoes.

“It was so easy to write,” says Campbell, who strapped on his his iconic Red Dog Fender Telecaster — a unique mutt of a guitar — for the recording session. “But when we went in the studio, under the microscope with the producer and everything, trying to make it great, it took a lot of work. We just couldn’t get it to come together for so many takes. I found myself thinking, Maybe we’ll never get this.”

What kept them going was Campbell’s four-track demo of the tune: It was so good that the band knew the song was worth the effort.

“We must have recorded that 100 times,” Campbell told Songfacts. “I remember being so frustrated with it one day that — I think this is the only time I ever did this — I just left the studio and went out of town for two days. I just couldn't take the pressure anymore, but then I came back and when we regrouped we were actually able to get it down on tape.”

Tom Petty And The Heartbreakers - Refugee - YouTube Watch On

“Refugee” went on to reach number 15 on the charts — the highest placement for a Heartbreakers record at the time — when it was released as a single in 1980.

“After going through something like that, it’s a beautiful thing when a stranger comes up to you, and they tell you how your music has made their life happier,” Campbell tells Under the Radar. “For instance, I’ve had several people tell me they played ‘Here Comes My Girl,’ which is a song I wrote with Tom, at their wedding because it was that important to them.

“When someone shares that kind of joy with you, or when someone just tells me a certain song of ours lifted their spirits… I mean, what more could a person want?”

297,65,Did American Eagle apologize for Sydney Sweeney campaign? Controversy explained,https://www.dexerto.com/tv-movies/sydney-sweeney-american-eagle-controversy-explained-3232576/,31/07/2025 11:19,dexerto,GB,refugee,"After accusations of “making fascist propaganda” with its Sydney Sweeney ad campaign, an apology seemingly released by American Eagle has been spreading across social media – but is it real?

Sweeney appears in three brief ads. In one of them, she doesn’t speak: she fixes a car, gets in it, and does a donut, with text on the screen and a voiceover saying, “Sydney Sweeney has great jeans.” In another ad, the actress playfully talks about the comfort of the jeans and how “they make your butt look amazing.”

Article continues after ad

The third ad has been the source of controversy. As the camera drifts up from her legs to her upper body, she says, “Genes are passed down from parents to offspring, often determining traits like hair color, personality, and even eye color. My jeans are blue.”

A harmless play on words, or a promotion of eugenics? That’s the debate, but if you believe you’ve seen American Eagle apologize for the commercials… you’ve been duped.

Did American Eagle issue an apology for Sydney Sweeney ads?

No, American Eagle hasn’t released an apology for its Sydney Sweeney campaign.

A fake, satirical response that jokes about Sweeney’s “general hotness” has been mistaken (accidentally and wilfully) for an official statement, with several right-wing accounts posting it on X/Twitter (one such tweet has amassed more than 500,000 views).

It originated from Karim Jovian, a content creator with over 2.5 million followers on Facebook. “American Eagle responds to the backlash from jealous women,” he wrote with a photo of the fake statement.

Facebook: Karim Jovian

“To Whom It May Concern, we sincerely apologize for featuring Sydney Sweeney in our recent advertisement. In hindsight, we underestimated the combined impact of her blue eyes, blonde hair, and general hotness,” it reads.

“Also, we did not realize how big her boobs would be. Our marketing team has been sent to denim sensitivity training. Thank you for your feedback. Please stop emailing us. (We’re still trying to recover from the group chat fallout.)”

To be clear, this isn’t real, nor is the apology posted by Clickhole (a website that intentionally “panders to and misleads” its readers).

Has American Eagle responded to the backlash?

American Eagle

American Eagle hasn’t released any statement via its official channels, nor has the company apologized in response to the backlash.

According to TMZ, “sources with direct knowledge” of the campaign aren’t bothered by the controversy. “This is yet another example of how social media is just not reflective of real life,” they told the outlet.

Article continues after ad

“The absurd response from some corners of the internet is absolutely not reflective of how American Eagle’s customers feel.

“The bottom line is that this was about creating a great pair of jeans and supporting a very worthy cause through some of the proceeds going to domestic violence prevention. Anything beyond that is noise that is not registering with the average person.”

Why is the Sydney Sweeney ad so controversial?

American Eagle

Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad has been accused of reinforcing eugenics: a largely discredited theory that humans can be improved by selective breeding to promote particular traits.

Article continues after ad

While it originated in the 19th century, it’s most commonly associated with Nazi ideology, with Adolf Hitler incorporating eugenics in Mein Kampf and his support of an “Aryan master race” (and, in turn, the persecution of those falsely said to have “diseased, inferior, or dangerous genetic material”, such as Jews).

Sweeney has blonde hair and blue eyes, the traits typically attributed to Aryanism. That’s why one TikToker described the ads as “weird, like fascist weird, like Nazi propaganda weird.”

Article continues after ad

“Should we be surprised that a company whose name is literally American Eagle is making fascist propaganda like this? Probably not, but it’s still really shocking,” they continued.

“Like, a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, white woman is talking about her good genes. That is Nazi propaganda.”

Dr Kristin, a psychologist on TikTok, also linked the ad to Nazi campaigns about “Aryan” women and the “global rise of white nationalist movements, especially in the US.”

Article continues after ad

While the ad has been praised by right-wing commentators (one hailed that the “woke era is over”), American Eagle hasn’t shied away from diversity in its marketing. In 2017, it released a denim hijab, with a Somali refugee turned American model praising the company for “encouraging young America to follow their passions, express their individuality, and pursue their unique paths” (via the NY Post).

Article continues after ad

Its Aerie lingerie brand has also been praised for catering to a wider range of sizes and championing body confidence.

However, there could be a wider problem beyond American Eagle. According to Jazmin Baurrell, founder of brand consulting agency Lizzie Della Creative Strategies, there have been more ads in general that feature white models.

“I can see us going back to a world where diversity is not really the standard expectation in advertising,” she told The Independent.

Article continues after ad

This also comes after Sweeney promoted “Bathwater Bliss”, a soap made by Dr Squatch infused with her actual bathwater – which sold out almost immediately. This year, she’s also appeared in ads for Dr Squatch bodywash and Hey Dude.

298,63,EU Strengthens Lifeline for Sahrawi Refugees with €5M Annual WFP Aid Support,https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/other/3525239-eu-strengthens-lifeline-for-sahrawi-refugees-with-5m-annual-wfp-aid-support,31/07/2025 11:18,devdiscourse,GB,refugee,"As global crises shift attention elsewhere, the European Union (EU) is reaffirming its commitment to one of the world’s longest-standing yet often overlooked refugee crises—the plight of the Sahrawi refugees in Algeria. Through sustained funding to the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the EU ensures vital food assistance reaches more than 133,000 vulnerable people every month in the desolate Tindouf refugee camps of southwestern Algeria.

July 2025 marks the second year of a multi-year partnership, under which the EU commits €5 million annually to help meet the basic nutritional needs of Sahrawi refugees—many of whom have lived in semi-permanent camps since 1975, following the Western Sahara conflict that displaced tens of thousands.

A Lifeline in the Desert: Food and Nutrition at the Core

Situated in the harsh Sahara desert with limited access to economic opportunities, over 80% of Sahrawi refugees rely entirely on humanitarian aid for survival. Through its implementing partner, the Algerian Red Crescent, WFP provides monthly general food rations carefully designed to meet the population’s energy and micronutrient needs.

WFP’s assistance includes staples such as cereals, pulses, vegetable oil, sugar, and fortified foods, and is increasingly paired with nutrition-sensitive programming that seeks to prevent and treat malnutrition, particularly among children under five and pregnant or breastfeeding women.

“We are deeply grateful to the European Union for their unwavering support and commitment to the Sahrawi refugees,” said Aline Rumonge, WFP Representative and Country Director in Algeria. “This strong and reliable partnership provides the sustained funding we need to deliver life-saving assistance while improving the effectiveness of our operations in the camps.”

Addressing Malnutrition and Supporting Maternal Health

In 2024 alone, the WFP distributed nearly 19,000 metric tons of food, a critical lifeline in a region where local food production is virtually impossible due to the arid climate and geographical isolation.

A key feature of the EU-WFP initiative is the use of cash-based transfers (CBTs) for nearly 8,600 pregnant and breastfeeding women, enabling them to diversify their diets by purchasing fresh produce and protein-rich foods from local markets. This strategy has proven essential in reducing the risk of anaemia and improving maternal health outcomes.

Moreover, WFP is distributing specialised nutritious products, such as Super Cereal and lipid-based nutrient supplements, to combat moderate acute malnutrition (MAM) among young children, a growing concern in camp environments where infections and poor sanitation increase vulnerability.

Social Behaviour Change and Community Engagement

In line with a more holistic humanitarian approach, the EU-funded operations also support Social Behaviour Change (SBC) campaigns aimed at fostering better nutrition practices at the household level. These initiatives are designed to educate caregivers on infant feeding, hygiene, and meal preparation, ensuring that families make optimal use of the food and resources they receive.

SBC strategies are particularly important in contexts like Tindouf, where nutrition knowledge, cultural norms, and food availability all impact how humanitarian assistance is consumed and its long-term effectiveness.

A Historic and Enduring Partnership

The EU is not a newcomer to the humanitarian response in Algeria. Since 2003, it has contributed over €102 million (US$123.4 million) to WFP’s operations in support of Sahrawi refugees, making it one of the most consistent and significant donors to this protracted emergency.

WFP itself has been operating in the Sahrawi camps since 1986, navigating evolving challenges while maintaining rigorous oversight mechanisms in cooperation with both national and international organizations. These partnerships are crucial in ensuring that aid reaches the people for whom it is intended, particularly as funding needs grow and global attention fades.

“With global humanitarian budgets stretched thin, this enduring partnership underscores a shared commitment to ensure Sahrawi refugees are not forgotten,” said Rumonge.

The Road Ahead: Humanitarian Needs Remain High

Despite ongoing efforts, food insecurity and undernutrition remain persistent concerns in the camps. The geopolitical stalemate around Western Sahara, compounded by climate-related pressures and limited donor visibility, continues to restrict sustainable development options for the Sahrawi population.

WFP and its partners are actively exploring resilience-building strategies, including small-scale livelihood initiatives and improved food systems within the humanitarian context. However, these approaches depend on the stability and predictability of donor support, making the EU’s multi-year funding model all the more valuable.

A Shared Commitment to Dignity and Survival

The EU’s continued investment in food assistance for Sahrawi refugees is more than just a humanitarian contribution—it is a lifeline that supports dignity, health, and hope for communities that have endured decades of displacement. As the world grapples with a growing list of emergencies, the Sahrawi crisis stands as a reminder of the importance of sustained global solidarity.

By renewing its financial and moral commitment, the European Union not only upholds humanitarian values but also affirms the universal right to food, health, and a future free from fear and deprivation.",NewsData.io,,,not found,,,,"Dev Discourse, devdiscourse.com, Devdiscourse",not found,https://ground.news/interest/devdiscourse,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,Center,Very High,Center,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Center,devdiscourse.com,,devdiscourse,237,UK,,,,

Get our newsletter!

Key takeaways: How Chiune Sugihara saved Jews during World War II In the summer of 1940, the Japanese government barred Sugihara, the consul in Soviet-occupied Lithuania, from issuing transit visas to Jews hoping to flee war-torn Europe.

Sugihara proceeded anyway, enabling thousands of Jewish refugees to flee east via the Soviet Union and Japan.

Nobuki Sugihara was 19 years old when, in the summer of 1968, an unexpected call came in from the Israeli Embassy in Tokyo. A diplomat was searching for his father, Chiune Sugihara, who was visiting family in Japan while on a break from his job at a trading firm in Moscow. In a meeting soon after, Joshua Nishri produced a piece of paper: a transit visa issued by the elder Sugihara in 1940, when he was serving as the Japanese consul in Lithuania. The visa had enabled Nishri and his brother to escape from Europe and survive the Holocaust, which claimed the lives of six million Jews during World War II.

Nishri was among the crowd of Jewish refugees who had gathered outside of Sugihara’s home in the Lithuanian city of Kaunas (then known in English as Kovno) in July 1940, desperate to flee the growing menace of Nazi Germany. Sugihara chose to do what most other diplomats would not: He defied the directives of his government, issuing more than 2,000 transit visas that authorized holders to leave Soviet-occupied Lithuania and pass through Japan as they sought safety further afield.

The exact number of people Sugihara helped save from the Nazis is unknown but likely numbers in the thousands. Some of his visas were used by entire households, while others weren’t used at all. In recent decades, Sugihara has received recognition for his wartime actions, but the story of his bravery has been plagued by inaccuracies and exaggerations. Now, Sugihara’s son Nobuki, who was born in 1949, four years after World War II ended, is setting the record straight.

“I didn’t realize what my father did, what he was for the Jewish people,” until Nishri tracked him down, Nobuki says. “Some people say ‘hero’—I didn’t know why.”

Sugihara was born on January 1, 1900, in Japan’s Gifu Prefecture. When he was a teenager, his father moved the rest of the family to Japanese-occupied Korea, leaving Sugihara behind to complete his studies. Sugihara’s father intended for him to become a doctor, but he shrugged off the exam. Infuriated, his father told him to leave home, prompting him to enroll at a university in Tokyo.

While in school, Sugihara applied for a study abroad language program funded by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In 1919, he was sent to Harbin, Manchuria, a region in northeast China that held strategic significance for both Japan and Soviet Russia. He quickly achieved fluency in Russian and joined the diplomatic corps. He spent 16 formative years in Manchuria, marrying a Russian woman (they later divorced) and moving with ease among the multinational mores of this strategically coveted corner of China.

“Manchuria was a churning cauldron of political intrigue, all of these different people who were refugees there or vying for economic and land interests there [or] political influence, representing many different countries,” says historian Pamela Rotner Sakamoto, author of Japanese Diplomats and Jewish Refugees: A World War II Dilemma.

After Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 and established a puppet government known as Manchukuo in 1932, Sugihara helped negotiate the purchase of a critical railway system from the Soviets for a fraction of the price. But Japan’s occupation of China was marked by brutality; Sugihara’s disapproval of the Japanese soldiers’ behavior led him to request a transfer to Tokyo.

Back in Japan, Sugihara met and married a woman named Yukiko Kikuchi. He received a new assignment to Moscow, but the Soviets denied him a visa—retribution, he later speculated, for his interactions with exiles in Harbin and his role in the railway negotiations. Instead, he spent the next two years in Helsinki, Finland, where his family grew with the arrival of two sons, Hiroki and Chiaki.

Sugihara entered the world of European politics at an especially perilous time, made more complex still by Japan’s tenuous alliances. The Nazis’ military intentions were clear, but Britain and other European nations were hesitant to respond. In March 1938, German troops marched into Austria, followed a year later by Czechoslovakia.

Also in 1939, Germany and the Soviet Union signed a nonaggression pact that effectively nullified an earlier agreement made by Adolf Hitler’s government. In 1936, Germany and Japan had codified the Anti-Comintern Pact, which was formed on the basis of their shared antipathy to both communist and Western powers.

The superseding German-Soviet pact paved the way for the short-lived allies to divide Poland between them, in addition to giving the Soviets free rein in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia, which were then independent, neutral nations.

Confident they would not encounter opposition from the Soviets, the Nazis invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, finally triggering a declaration of war by Great Britain and France. The Soviet Union followed suit, invading Poland from the east on September 17.

“The brutality of Nazi soldiers … toward the residents of the areas that they occupied had increased day by day,” Sugihara later recalled in an unpublished memoir provided by his family. “The cruelty they demonstrated in the treatment of the Jews was indeed unbearable to my eyes.”

Around the same time that the war broke out, Sugihara arrived at a new posting in Kaunas, where his third son, Haruki, was born in April 1940. The location of the new one-man consulate offered Sugihara a vantage point to monitor and report back to Tokyo on movements by both the Germans and the Soviets, whose tanks rolled onto the Lithuanian city’s streets on June 15, 1940.

The division of Poland had placed Jewish refugees in a perilous position, trapped between the specter of Nazi aggression and the tightening grip of Soviet authorities. Many fled from Poland to Lithuania, which a had long tradition as a hub of Jewish culture in Europe, with thriving synagogues, yeshivas and businesses. The country’s Jewish population rose from a prewar estimate of 160,000 to roughly 250,000 by 1941.

“People tried to get out, to go somewhere, but there was no particular place you could go because either it was under the Russians or under the Germans, and the war was in between,” said Lucille Szepsenwol Camhi, who was a teenager when she and her sister escaped to Lithuania, in a 1999 oral history interview.

Another individual who fled Poland was Bernard Salomon, who later received the 299th Sugihara visa. “He unfortunately was still there when the borders were closed, so he had to escape across barbed wire, and [he bribed] border guards,” says Bernard’s son Rick Salomon, who is a co-founder and board member of the Illinois Holocaust Museum & Education Center. Like Nobuki, Rick only learned of his father’s wartime saga as an adult.

Once in Lithuania, Jewish refugees hoping to escape even farther from the Nazis found themselves blocked by strict immigration quotas, including in the United States. The occupying Soviets ordered foreign consulates in Kaunas shuttered by August 25. In this tense time, most consulates were disinclined to yield to the pleas of the increasingly desperate Jews in search of a way out.

One loophole emerged: Contacted by several Dutch-born Jews living in Lithuania, the Dutch ambassador authorized his appointed consul in Kaunas, Jan Zwartendijk, to mark refugees’ passports with a note stating they could enter the Caribbean island of Curaçao, which is part of the Netherlands, with only a landing permit. (Zwartendijk was not a professional diplomat, but rather a businessman working for the radio company Philips who had been reassigned to the consulate in June.)

The documentation omitted a crucial detail: Admission to Curaçao and other Dutch territories “was the prerogative of the colonial governors, who rarely allowed it,” the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum explains on its website. The Dutch ambassador and the consul “had reacted to the human crisis in their midst by issuing documents that were useless except for one purpose—they helped refugees flee from Lithuania.”

This is where Sugihara came in. To issue transit visas that allowed holders to travel through the Soviet Union and Japan en route to a different country, the consul needed the refugees to have a set final destination. The Curaçao permit holders’ paperwork fulfilled this requirement, even if the refugees didn’t actually intend to settle in the Dutch colony.

Though Sugihara never met them, the Dutch representatives’ workaround accelerated the need for Japanese transit visas. His was the final, critical piece in this link for those fleeing Lithuania.

“No one would pay any attention to us,” recalled Susan Bluman, who was 19 when Germany invaded her home country of Poland, in a 1999 oral history interview. “No one wanted us. … We were desperate, absolutely desperate. We didn’t see any hope, absolutely no hope. We just were a people with no land, nobody to turn to. And then we heard about Chiune Sugihara.”

In the early morning hours of July 18, 1940, the Sugihara family heard shouting outside of their home on the second floor of the Japanese consulate. They looked out to see crowds gathering.

Sugihara asked those assembled to send in a handful of representatives to speak on their behalf. The five men chosen by the crowd implored the consul to grant them safe passage through Japan, as the alternative was imprisonment and death at the hands of the Nazis. In response, Sugihara explained that he needed to seek permission from Tokyo to issue transit visas on the scale required by such a large group. This request would take several days to discuss, and its success hinged on negotiations for an alliance between Japan, Germany and Italy.

“He was very sure that [Tokyo] would never give him permission to do anything that might jeopardize the pending agreement,” wrote Anne Akabori in her 2005 biography of Sugihara.

“Looking outside, we felt much sorrow for them,” Sugihara’s wife Yukiko later recalled. “Their ragged appearance, with tears streaming down their faces and women in the crowd crying … knowing that if they were to be caught, they would most likely be killed.”

After an exchange of telegrams in which Sugihara argued that the visas should be granted for humanitarian reasons, Tokyo twice denied its consul permission, citing public safety concerns associated with the influx of a large group of refugees.

“Now I was at a total loss,” Sugihara wrote in his memoir. He agonized over the decision, a lone diplomat in Lithuania, about to be further isolated from his headquarters, knowing he could be punished for disobedience if he moved forward with issuing visas anyway.

Ultimately, Sugihara could not avert his eyes from the desperation that was right before him. As he reflected in his memoir, he “came to the conclusion that humanitarianism and philanthropism should be the priority.”

Once resolved in his course of action, Sugihara worked at a furious pace, aiming to issue 200 to 300 visas each day. He wrote until his hands cramped, skipping meals to process even more visas as his family packed away their home and prepared to leave Kaunas, as ordered by the Soviets. “My husband issued those visas in defiance of his government’s orders because he was following his conscience,” Yukiko said in 1995.

In the summer of 1940, Camhi and her sister stood outside the Japanese consulate in long lines on multiple occasions a few days apart in hopes of making it inside. When they finally pushed their way up the crowded staircase, the sisters pleaded with Sugihara, telling him that their mother had no papers and their father was deceased.

“He looked very sympathetic[ally] at us, and he just stamped, gave us the visa right there on the spot,” Camhi recalled in 1999. “My sister and I got hysterical, started to cry, and started to say, ‘Thank you, thank you,’ in Polish. And he just raised his hand, like saying, ‘It’s OK.’ And that’s it, and we went out of the room.”

For those who received visas from Sugihara in the summer of 1940, the thin line between life and death came down to a simple piece of paper, a bureaucratic stamp that enabled them to travel through Soviet Siberia to Vladivostok and then on to ports in Japan.

Sugihara, exhausted and suffering the ill health effects of his tremendous effort, continued to issue visas until shortly before he and his family departed for Prague, which was now under German control, in early September 1940. He closed the consulate before moving on to Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia) and then Bucharest, Romania.

The balance of wartime alliances had shifted once again when Japan signed the Tripartite Pact with Germany and Italy on September 27, 1940, creating the Axis powers and negating the substance of Germany’s nonaggression pact with the Soviets. On June 22, 1941, the Nazis launched Operation Barbarossa, invading the Soviet Union.

Two days later, on June 24, the Nazis reached Kaunas. In the months that followed, German soldiers, Lithuanian nationalists and anti-Soviet paramilitary forces murdered thousands of Jews in the city. By mid-August, the Nazis had sealed the remaining Jews off in the Kaunas Ghetto, which was used as a site of forced labor. The Nazis and their collaborators killed around 90 percent of Lithuania’s Jewish population during the Holocaust—one of the highest rates in Europe. In Kaunas specifically, just 2,000 of the roughly 35,000 to 40,000 Jews living in the city survived.

Many of the refugees who received transit visas from Sugihara made their way to the Japanese city of Kobe, a hub for those fleeing the Holocaust. In the months leading up to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, the Japanese government forced most of these individuals to continue on to Shanghai, already home to an estimated 17,000 German and Austrian Jews who had fled persecution in the 1930s. Living conditions for Jews in the Japanese-controlled Chinese city were cramped and dilapidated, but many who reached Shanghai ultimately survived the Holocaust.

Shanghai was a “stranger-than-fiction loophole to which people could flee because you did not need a destination visa to [go there],” says historian Sakamoto. “A lot about getting out of Europe was the red tape of documents. … Shanghai, since it was a treaty port [open to foreign merchants], was quite international and allowed people to come in.”

The Mir Yeshiva, a leading Jewish educational institution based briefly in Lithuania, was the only Eastern European school of its kind to survive the war intact. It continued operating in exile in Shanghai, thanks to the visas issued to its students by Sugihara.

Among the other refugees who found their way to Shanghai was Bernard Salomon, who ended up working as an accountant in India for the remainder of the war. “But for the acts of Sugihara, I wouldn’t be here, and as my son [Mark] said, neither would he,” says Bernard’s son Rick. He points to his own grandchildren—Bernard’s great-grandchildren—as the continuation of this chain of life.

Stationed in Bucharest when the war ended, the Sugiharas were imprisoned for more than a year by the victorious Soviet Union. Finally able to return to Japan in 1947, the family saw their hardship turn to grief when their young son Haruki, born in Kaunas seven years earlier, died of leukemia.

Returning to the foreign ministry in hopes of receiving another posting, Sugihara was instead asked to sign a resignation letter with no further explanation. “He didn’t ask the reason. He just signed and left,” says Nobuki. “He knew [it was] because he had disobeyed the order not to issue visas.”

Despite that dismissal, Yukiko later said her husband “never regretted what he did.”

According to Nobuki, Sugihara found work where he could, including as a laborer at the Yokohama port; as a shopkeeper; and as a Russian translator for NHK, Japan’s national broadcaster. In the early 1960s, he accepted a job working for a trading company in Moscow, where he remained until the mid-1970s, visiting his family periodically—including in the summer of 1968, when Nishri tracked him down.

For decades, Sugihara had not known the fate of those he’d helped by issuing visas, or if they’d reached their destinations. He could only surmise that a handful had made it through, unsure how to thank the man who had saved them with his act of bureaucratic defiance. During his reunion with Nishri, Sugihara finally learned that most of the refugees he’d aided had survived.

The year after the initial 1968 meeting, Sugihara agreed to visit Israel, where Nobuki was now enrolled in university. While there, he met with Zorach Warhaftig, then-minister of religious affairs, who had been among the five representatives chosen to meet with him in July 1940. Sugihara spoke little of what he had done, seemingly not seeking attention. When Nobuki asked his father why he had helped the Jewish refugees, he replied that “the very simple answer was because I pity them—nothing else, you know,” Nobuki recalls. “He knew the situation of Jewish people at that time.”

“Sugihara was our savior,” said Bluman, whose siblings and parents all died during the war, in her oral history interview. “We never thought in different terms about him. But the problem was that we never knew his name. We didn’t know his name until 1985,” when Sugihara’s wartime heroics were gaining wider recognition.

Some recipients of Sugihara’s visas never learned his identity. As the daughter of one survivor told Nobuki at an event in New York in 2019, “My father spoke about your father, and about the visa that he got. And he always [wondered], ‘How can I thank this man? I hope I will see him in my lifetime.’ So I’m taking this opportunity … to say thank you for making our family exist.” More than 150 people—including some who had received visas firsthand as children—lined up to share similar stories.

In 1984, the Israeli Holocaust remembrance organization Yad Vashem named Sugihara “Righteous Among the Nations,” making him the only Japanese citizen to be honored with the title, which recognizes individuals who saved Jews during the Holocaust. Yukiko attended the ceremony on her ailing husband’s behalf. Sugihara died in 1986 at age 86.

“If not [for] Mr. Sugihara being there and doing such a noble, unselfish thing by giving the visas to me and my sister and a number of other people, none of us would be here,” Camhi reflected in her oral history interview. “We would be part of the Holocaust.”",NewsData.io,-4.03,,https://adfontesmedia.com/smithsonian-magazine-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,45.3,,not found,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/smithsonian-magazine-media-bias,,,,,,,,Center,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,smithsonianmag.com,,smithsonianmag,29,USA,,,,

DeMaria, officials said, is the owner and operator of Immigration Matters Legal Services, currently located in Oxford.

According to court documents, police allege that DeMaria falsely represented herself to clients and prospective clients as an immigration attorney who could help undocumented residents obtain employment authorization, or ""work permits.""

However, officials said, she was not a licensed attorney and had no authorization to represent individuals in immigration proceedings.

An indictment alleges that DeMaria, from December of 2021 through July of 2024, prepared fraudulent asylum forms, without the applicants' knowledge or consent, making false statements on these forms.

For example, law enforcement officials noted, a fraudulent form may list that an undocumented resident was seeking asylum in America due to ""political opinion"" or ""torture convention"" when DeMaria's clients weren't seeking asylum on with of these categories and never told DeMaria that they were eligible under these categories.

Also, court documents claim, clients were not aware of these fraudulent forms nor were applicants told that, if those fraudulent asylum applications were rejected, they would be placed in removal proceedings.

DeMaria, court documents claim, charged undocumented residents between $6,000 to $9,000 and couples $12,000 to $15,000 in order to file the allegedly fraudulent forms for work permits.

Police believe DeMaria made clients pay in cash or in transactions that were deposited into personal accounts that she could withdraw at casinos.

If convicted, officials said, DeMaria could face up to 240 years in prison and a $4 million fine. Prosecutors also plan to seek DeMaria to turn over all of the funds gained through this alleged scam, which officials believe, totaled at least $1 million.

305,49,New hope for Quebec video game developers struggling to find work,https://www.cp24.com/news/canada/2025/07/30/new-hope-for-quebec-video-game-developers-struggling-to-find-work/,31/07/2025 11:18,cp24,GB,asylum,"Indie Asylum started curating a job board for the Quebec gaming industry on Discord.

When Quebecer Christopher Chancey got his start in the video game industry, things were already heating up. Since then, the industry has grown exponentially.

“I started my studio in 2014 and there was maybe 30 studios at the time,” he says. “Now we’re about at 350 studios in Quebec.”

Today Chancey is the general manager of Indie Asylum, a hub of independent video game studios operating in Montreal’s Mile-End neighbourhood.

He says that, despite the industry’s growth, it’s not always easy to find work, especially since the province announced cuts to multi-media tax credits last year.

“Right now, because of the economic climate, tariffs, there’s less investment in video games because everyone’s a little tighter. the interest rates are up, and now this tax credit getting cut, well obviously people are not hiring,” he says. “The tax credits that independent studios would receive are been chopped by 40 to 60 per cent, depending on the size of the studio. So that leads to more challenges to be able to make longer games or to hire more staff.”

The job market is especially tough for junior developers. A few weeks ago, Indie Asylum started curating a job board for the Quebec gaming industry on the popular chat platform Discord.

Chancey says staff collect all the current job offers in the field, both Quebec-based jobs, and jobs that can be done remotely. It creates a one-stop shop for those searching specifically for postings within the video game industry.

So far, more than 1,800 people have joined the Discord channel.

“It’s been extremely positive. Our Discord server doubled in size since we have announced this, which speaks to the issue, and we are having some testimonials now with people that are getting interviews and so on,” says Chancey. “So it’s fun to see that there’s an actual impact.”

Chancey says they can do this because Indie Asylum gets funding from the City of Montreal and the province.

According to the Quebec Video Game Guild, there are currently 15,000 jobs in Quebec’s videogame industry, and that is expected to remain steady in the coming year.

“The trend we’re seeing is relative stability in headcount due to lateral movement within the workforce, despite cuts at certain studios,” says the Guild’s head of communications and operations, Emilien Roscanu.

“Some production cycles are ending, which is leading to reorganizations; at the same time, several mid-sized and large studios are still actively hiring for various projects, so we expect this stability to continue this year.”

The future is more uncertain for junior developers.

“The market remains competitive for more senior talent but very difficult for junior talent,” Roscanu adds. “We have 1000 juniors coming out of universities and colleges each year in video games, but few of them can find jobs unfortunately. Economic uncertainty, tax credits cuts and lack of new funding are all contributing to this outlook.”

Chancey is hopeful, noting some companies have already reached out to Indie Asylum directly with job postings. He adds that in the next phase of the project, they’ll survey members of the job board to see how many people were able to secure a job offer.

“Sometimes it just takes someone to give momentum to a project and then people kind of organize themselves. So we’re just supporting in the background right now and people are kind of gelling together and trying to help each other out,” he says.",NewsData.io,,,not found,,,,"CP24, CP24 Toronto, CP24.com, CablePulse24, CP24 News",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cp24/,,not found,LEAST BIASED (1.5),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,,,Unknown,Center,Unknown,Unknown,Center,cp24.com,,cp24,101,USA,,,,

HOTEL BEATING Migrant strangled and punched his girlfriend in a brutal attack at four star taxpayer-funded hotel

A MIGRANT strangled and punched his girlfriend in a brutal attack at their taxpayer-funded hotel.

Mamadou Alion Diallo, 27, lashed out at Zenabou Quedraogo at the four star Heston Hyde Hotel in Hounslow, West London.

Diallo, who is from Mali, has now been found guilty of intentional strangulation and assault by beating.

Isleworth Crown Court heard Diallo strangled his partner on October 23.

The attack came to light when police were called to the hotel following a second assault on January 4.

Prosecutor Ravinder Johal said: ""The argument happened in Diallo's room at the migrant hotel he lived in, in Hounslow.

""Both are asylum seekers.

""Neighbours in the hotel heard the victim screaming, and saw Diallo go out into the lobby. Police were immediately called.

""Diallo punched the victim on the head. She was left with a massive bruise.""

The court heard Diallo has ""moved around different countries"" since leaving Mali.

He is currently staying at the three-star migrant hotel, Thistle City, in Barbican, Central London.

The migrant accommodation has been riddled with crime - with 41 migrants charged with more than 90 offences in the past year.

Diallo was bailed ahead of sentencing at the same court on August 28.

Recorder Annabel Darlow KC said: ""You must attend this court on August 28.

""If you fail to do so, you will commit a further separate offence, and sentence may proceed in your absence.

""By adjourning, the court makes no undertaking at all that this matter won't be dealt with by way of immediate custodial sentence.""

The gig was announced today (July 31) on Eno’s social media pages, and will be held on September 17.

Titled ‘Together For Palestine’, the event will see Eno, Khaled Ziada, Khalid Abdalla and Tracey Seaward work as executive producers and enlist performances from “artists, musicians and people for whom silence feels impossible”.

Explaining why he is organising the event, Eno said: “I’ve had the good fortune to work with some of the world’s most remarkable artists for over 50 years. But one of my biggest regrets is that during that time so many of us have remained silent about Palestine.

“Often that silence has come from fear, real fear – that speaking out could provoke a backlash, close doors or end a career. But that’s now changing – partly because some artists and activists have lit the path, but mostly because the truth of what’s going on has become impossible to ignore.”

Highlighting the relief efforts made by Amnesty International and Doctors Without Borders, he added: “We can’t remain silent. Which is why I’m helping to organise Together for Palestine – a night of music, reflection and hope at Wembley Arena.

“Whether on stage or by video from around the world, this is a chance for us to stand together and say: this can’t continue.”

Also in the post, Eno confirmed that “every penny donated” will go to Palestinian partners through Choose Love, a UK charity supporting local humanitarians in conflict zones. Also, beyond financial support, he said the gig is about “sending a message of love and solidarity to the people of Palestine – that they haven’t been forgotten.”

“We see them, we hear them, and though we may be far away, we’re deeply connected – as we are to all humanity,” he concluded.

More details about the gig, including the artists included on the line-up, are set to be revealed at a later date. Tickets go on sale on Monday (August 4) at 10am BST, visit here for more information.

This won’t be the first time Brian Eno has used his platform to speak out in support of the people of Palestine. Earlier this year he urged Microsoft to cut ties with Israel in an open letter, and shared that he would be donating his fee from the Windows 95 chime (which he composed for them) to aid Palestine.

Before then, Eno was also part of a cohort of artists who signed an open letter to Field Day, urging it to distance itself from global investment firm KKR. The firm owns the festival’s parent company Superstruct Entertainment and invests “billions of pounds in companies which, for example, develop Israeli underground data centres, and advertise real estate on illegally occupied land in Israeli settlements in the West Bank”.

Last year, he implored the International Criminal Court to “exercise the mandate it has been given to prosecute war crimes”, joined forces with Nadine Shah, Maxine Peake and more in performing at a special benefit event in support of Palestine at London’s Union Chapel in April, and worked alongside members of Fontaines D.C., R.E.M, Bastille and more in reading out letters from Palestinians suffering in Gaza as part of a ‘Voices For Gaza’ initiative.

Earlier this month, he joined Kneecap, Fontaines D.C., Garbage and more in publicly supporting the alliance of musicians made by Massive Attack, which speaks out against “intimidations from within” the music industry against those speaking out in support of Palestine.",NewsData.io,,,not found,,,,"New Musical Express, NME, nme.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nme/,https://ground.news/interest/nme,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,Center,High,Center,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Center,nme.com,,nme,195,UK,,,,

National Crime Agency (NCA) officers worked with Bulgarian law enforcement partners to seize the 25 inflatable boats, which had just crossed the Kapitan Andreevo checkpoint near the border with Greece and Turkey.

The NCA said the seizure was thought to be the biggest single detection of small boats in 2025.

Jacque Beer, NCA's regional head of investigation, said: ""Taking them out before they could reach the shores of northern France means we have not only prevented crossings from happening and lives being put at risk, but also put a dent in the profits of the people smugglers.""

Mr Beer said the boats, which when inflated were about 8m (26.2ft) long and could have carried a total of up to 1,500 people, were ""completely ill-suited for use at sea"".

The seizure was made as part of an NCA operation, supported by Home Office International Operations, targeting supplies of small boat equipment moving into Europe.

The operation gathered intelligence which led to Bulgarian customs officers intercepting the lorry.

Martin Hewitt, the UK's border security commander, added: ""This seizure marks a significant step forward in our joint work alongside the NCA to disrupt the supply chain fuelling these dangerous small boat crossings.""

Mr Beer said work with international partners had intercepted more than 650 boats and engines since early 2023.

Just under 37,000 people crossed the English Channel and 695 small boats arrived in the UK without permission in 2024, according to Home Office statistics.

More than 24,000 people have crossed the Channel on small boats so far this year, current figures show.

Dozens of migrants, many with children, rush across the sand toward the water's edge.

French police are present, but they do not intervene.

For many of these men, women, and children, this moment marks the final chapter of a journey that began months ago, fleeing war, persecution, and economic collapse in countries as far afield as Iran, Eritrea, and Sudan.

Now, they face the potentially deadly crossing to the UK in a flimsy inflatable boat.

We watched as one vessel emerged from an inland waterway already crowded with people.

The vessel is soon dangerously overloaded.

Floating haphazardly, a baby is yanked onto the boat, as they yell out for more people to climb aboard.

Despite the dinghy taking on water - scooped out with a shoe - the crossing continues.

On the shore, police officers stood by, watching.

When I asked why no attempt was made to intervene, one officer said: ""It's for their safety.

""There are children there. We're not going to throw grenades at them. It's inhumane. But it's sad.""

French police protocol, along with international law, makes such interventions legally and morally complex once boats are afloat - especially when families are involved.

Despite millions spent by the UK government to curb these crossings, the numbers continue to rise.

As of the latest count, almost 15,000 people have already made the perilous journey across the Channel this year. Many more are expected this summer as the weather window widens.

In the makeshift camps near Dunkirk, migrants wait their turn for the smugglers to signal that conditions are right.

Ali Reza told us he fled Iran after converting to Christianity. He dreams of reaching Britain, where he hopes to claim asylum.

He said: ""Britain is good and accepts refugees. It has good behaviour for refugees.

""I think I'll get a good welcome. Many Iranian people go to Britain. There's good behaviour.""

325,99,Can Solnce Spark A Solar Power Revolution Among Indian MSMEs?,https://inc42.com/startups/can-solnce-spark-a-solar-power-revolution-among-indian-msmes/,31/07/2025 11:19,inc42,GB,channel crossings,"Solnce bets big on the government push to MSMEs and focusses on green power and sets up solar parks to lower cost load on small businesses

The profitable startup has doubled its revenue to INR 40 Cr with an INR 3 Cr profit in FY25, but anticipates lower profit in FY26 for the expansion it has chalked out

Gujarat-based cleantech startup Solnce helps MSMEs and households in the adoption of solar energy by resolving policy hurdles and securing subsidies

In the 300 days of sunshine a year, a part of modern-day India endures a darkness that clouds its 300 GW solar power dream for 2030. Around the same time, the country aims to be a $5 Tn economy, pushing its decarbonisation drive harder.

Paradoxically, at the wheel for at least 30% of the Indian GDP, micro, small and medium businesses or MSMEs often find themselves locked in that solar darkness.

“MSMEs are facing the biggest challenge in solar adoption, despite their willingness to do so. This cannot continue. It is high time we found a solution,” Gujarat-based entrepreneur Yash Tarwadi told Inc42. He rolled out Solnce to bridge the gap between intent and action of solar installation.

The gap appears wider as MSMEs contribute 10-15% of total industrial emissions in India. Even though these businesses have been trying to adopt solar power to check their operational costs, the process of going green continues to be full of hurdles.

A SIDBI report recently pointed out that the green economy has significance in MSMEs beyond environmental considerations, such as reaching profitability through energy savings and enhancing market competitiveness.

In recent years, as part of its 2070 net-zero promises, India has taken big bets on cleantech – from solar to EV. Solar adoption has proliferated, helped by policy reforms, with the Centre claiming to have turned 50% of its installed capacity to non-fossil fuel sources by 2025 – five years ahead of its Paris Agreement deadline.

In step, the government has lined up financial incentives for MSMEs switching to solar power, such as a rooftop solar subsidy of up to 40% under the MNRE scheme for systems below 3 kW and 20% for systems between 3 kW and 10 kW.

Businesses, however, often find the policy support more robust for residential installations. These include the PM Surya Ghar: Muft Bijli Yojana, an initiative to boost domestic rooftop solar, and PM-KUSUM for solar-powered irrigation systems.

Despite the government initiatives, solar adoption faces multiple challenges – from broken supply chains and policy complications to cost and value concerns – not just for the MSMEs, but also for other industries.

“It isn’t that MSMEs are our only focus. In fact, we started off by catering to residential applications, as the problems are commonplace. But MSMEs are our main focus as the potential here is huge,” said Tarwadi, who has helped over 1,000 houses and entrepreneurs harness the power of the sun since 2021.

Solnce provides end-to-end service – from connecting customers with the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) service providers to post-installation maintenance.

“I didn’t want it to be part of a problem. I wanted to be part of a solution,” said the founder, as his startup competes with multiple local suppliers and stakeholders because of a decentralised ecosystem that’s both a challenge as well as a positive.

Pain Points Under The Sun

It didn’t take long for Tarwadi, then a fresh chemical engineering graduate, passionate about green power, to realise that solar as an area of business was highly scalable. His earliest project, a solar concentrator to convert seawater into potable water, received grants, but it highlighted that scaling it would need a huge capital infusion.

A deeper understanding of the market brought the problems to the fore. Pricing was the biggest hurdle, he felt, as he floated Solnce. There were multiple distributors of TATA’s solar panels in the market, quoting widely varying prices for the same products in the same city.

“Sometimes, the variations were as high as INR 3 Lakh in industrial installations, which would leave the customer confused as the awareness of the technology was in its nascent state,” he recounted. “We succeeded because of our transparent pricing.”

Then came the policy hurdles. One of Solnce’s early MSME customers failed to get the discom permission to install solar panels as it was involved in a disputed land case. Solnce took up the project and helped the company with a 20kW solar installation and helped it get the subsidy.

It was during this project that Tarwadi met Chintan Shah, who later joined Solnce as a cofounder. The duo has since doubled down on solar installations in both residential and industrial applications across 10 cities, including Surat, Ahmedabad, Lucknow and Rajkot. It has also made a direct presence in a few more cities through supply chains or through distribution channels.

Solnce claims that it delivers more value by keeping the installation process transparent. The way it has bridged customers with stakeholders involved in the process has helped build trust.

Alliance To Soak Up The Sun

The unusual name with an apparently missing vowel is a union of two distinct words – sol, shortened from solar, and alliance, which tells its mission to create an order in a fractured market. Solnce is structured as an aggregator for solar power.

The cleantech startup runs two apps – one is customer-facing and the other is business-facing. The consumer app helps new users find out their eligibility amount for solar installation, which varies depending on the discoms, their electricity bills, and a few other factors. After these checks, the users can place their request for solar installation, which is then allotted to engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) companies.

Solnce takes care of all the financial, regulatory, and compliance procedures. Customers can track their power consumption on the app itself. It also provides a lifetime post-installation service and helps users track carbon credits and subsidies.

On the business app, EPC contractors and distributors can place their bids for upcoming projects and get the contracts.

The startup is also building solar parks for MSMEs. These are large chunks of land developed with common facilities like transmission infrastructure, road, water, drainage and communication network, with all statutory clearances. This solves the problem of space crunch for the MSMEs and saves installation costs. Solnce today serves at least 100 MSMEs across manufacturing, textile, diamond, chemical, pharma, cement and building material industries in a highly competitive market.

Its top clients include Gulmohar Embroideries, Spencer Weavetech, SA Diamonds, Vidya Bharti School, and new Jilla Panchayat Bhavan at Surat.

A Sunlit Harvest Of Success

Solnce has built an asset-light business with a sharp focus on staying profitable from day one. “For me, RoI is the key. Building a loss-making business is not even a choice,” Tarwadi noted.

Fixed firmly on the return on investment, Solnce has so far raised only INR 3 Cr from the likes of BoAt founder Aman Gupta (from Shark Tank India earlier this year), Parishi Diamond’s investment arm, Navitas Solar, and some angels.

The company follows a simple aggregator method for revenue generation. It keeps around 90% of the total project cost, while 6-10% of the rest goes to the EPC solution providers. The solar parks catering to the MSMEs make up over 60% of its revenue, while residential applications constitute 10%. The rest comes from individual industrial installations.

In FY25, the company generated INR 40 Cr in revenue, which was more than a 100% on-year growth from INR 19 Cr. Tarwadi said the business generated around INR 3 Cr in profit in the year ended March 2025, as against INR 27 Lakh a year ago.

On the contrary, its closest rival SolarSquare crossed INR 100 Cr in FY23 revenue, yet continued to be a loss-making entity. SolarSquare has raised more than $60 Mn in funding since its inception in 2015, which is huge compared to Solnce’s total funding.

“Our focus on being an MSME-first business and an asset-light model has helped us keep costs low and be profitable early on in our journey,” said the founder.

Along the road ahead, Solnce plans to explore another source of revenue by leveraging the scope of carbon credits. These are calculated from the reduction or removal of carbon emissions. It is measured in tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that an organisation removes from the environment. Companies with higher emissions can purchase carbon credits to offset their own emissions.

Solnce is tying up with registries that allow the transaction in carbon credits. Though in its infancy in India, carbon credits are fast gathering significance as countries double down on their emission reductions. By enabling and allowing its customers to transact these carbon credits through the Solnce app, the startup plans to cut a certain percentage of them to generate revenue.

Chasing The Sun, Powering Solar Future

Along the course of its Vision 2030, India has achieved a cumulative installed capacity of nearly 106 GW out of its nearly 300 GW of solar power target. This ambitious target unfurls a huge market opportunity for companies like Solnce that are structured to help businesses negotiate various hurdles that slow down the pace of adoption.

But who will steer the growth? It is the small businesses that are coming in a big way, making up nearly a third of the world’s fourth-largest economy, according to the Solnce founder.

India is home to more than 6 Cr registered MSMEs, creating jobs for more than 110 Mn people, but most of them are shelling out 5-10% or 10-20% of their operating income on electricity. “This augurs a great opportunity in a developing market like India. Rooftop solar power can help MSMEs build margins,” Tarwadi said.

Residential adoption, too, is picking up pace, making Solnce’s growth outlook more bullish.

The startup is betting big on its expansion and solar park projects, and anticipates a lower on-year growth in profit because of marketing expenses it will incur this year. The startup aims at an INR 100 Cr revenue on a profit of around INR 6 Cr for FY26.

Solnce plans to onboard around 5,000 customers in the next two years and focus more on residential adoption to beef up the numbers, while industrial installations will continue to drive volumes and revenues.

“But,” said the Solnce chief executive, “We need more conducive policies from the government to drive it to its net-zero goal by 2070. Without the source being green, the exercise of the EV push is also futile to a great extent.”

The question remains: When will the MSMEs come out of the solar darkness in India?

328,70,Colorado deputies disciplined for helping federal immigration agents,https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/colorado-deputies-disciplined-for-helping-federal-immigration-agents/,31/07/2025 11:24,durangoherald,GB,deportation,"×

DENVER (AP) — Two Colorado deputies have been disciplined for violating state law by helping federal agents make immigration arrests, and their sheriff says officers from other agencies have done the same.

One of the deputies, Alexander Zwinck, was sued by Colorado's attorney general last week, after his cooperation with federal immigration agents on a drug task force was revealed following the June arrest of a college student from Brazil with an expired visa.

Following an internal investigation, a second Mesa County Sheriff's Office deputy and task force member, Erik Olson, was also found to have shared information. The two deputies used a Signal chat to relay information to federal agents, according to documents released Wednesday by the sheriff's office.

Zwinck was placed on three weeks of unpaid leave, and Olson was given two weeks of unpaid leave, Mesa County Sheriff Todd Rowell said in a statement. Both were removed from the task force.

Two supervisors also were disciplined. One was suspended without pay for two days, and another received a letter of reprimand. A third supervisor received counseling.

State laws push back against Trump crackdown

The lawsuit and disciplinary actions come as lawmakers in Colorado and other Democratic-led states have crafted legislation intended to push back against President Donald Trump’s immigration crackdown.

Since Trump took office, pro-immigrant bills have advanced through legislatures in Illinois, Vermont, California, Connecticut and other states. The measures include stronger protections for immigrants in housing, employment and police encounters.

Trump has enlisted hundreds of state and local law enforcement agencies to help identify immigrants in the U.S. illegally and detain them for potential deportation. The Republican also relaxed longtime rules restricting immigration enforcement near schools, churches and hospitals.

Zwinck was sued under a new state law signed by Gov. Jared Polis about two weeks before the arrest of the student from Brazil. It bars local government employees including law enforcement from sharing identifying information about people with federal immigration officials. Previously, only state agencies were barred from doing that. It's one of a series of laws limiting the state's involvement in immigration enforcement passed over the years that has drawn criticism and a lawsuit from the federal government.

The U.S. Department of Justice has also sued Illinois and New York, as well as several cities in those states and New Jersey, alleging their policies violate the U.S. Constitution or federal immigration laws.

Officers say they were following established procedures

Zwinck and Olson told officials they thought they were operating according to long-standing procedures.

However, the internal investigation found they had both received and read two emails prior to the passage of the new law about previous limits on cooperation with immigration officials. The most recent was sent on Jan. 30, 2025, after an official for Homeland Security Investigations, part of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, had asked state and local law enforcement officers at a law enforcement meeting to contact HSI or ICE if they arrested a person for a violent crime who was believed not to be a citizen, the investigation documents said. The email said not to contact HSI or ICE.

Zwinck said he didn't know about the new law and was not interested in immigration enforcement.

“When I was out there, I wanted to find drugs, guns and bad guys,"" Zwinck said at a July 23 disciplinary hearing. ""And sending that information to HSI they provided the ability to give me real time background information on the person I was in contact with,” he said.

Olson, who said he had been with the sheriff’s office 18 years, testified at his disciplinary hearing that it was “standard practice” to send information up to federal agents during traffic stops.

""It was routine for ICE to show up on the back end of a traffic stop to do their thing,” Olson said. “I truly thought what we were doing was condoned by our supervision and lawful.”

A lawyer at a law firm listed as representing both deputies, Michael Lowe, did not immediately return a telephone call or email seeking comment.

Rowell said drug task force members from other law enforcement agencies, including the Colorado State Patrol, also shared information with immigration agents on the Signal chat. The state patrol denied the claim.

The sheriff faulted Attorney General Phil Weiser for filing the lawsuit against Zwinck before a local internal investigation was complete. He called on the Democrat, who is running for governor, to drop it.

“As it stands, the lawsuit filed by the Attorney General’s Office sends a demoralizing message to law enforcement officers across Colorado — that the law may be wielded selectively and publicly for maximum political effect rather than applied fairly and consistently,” he said.

Weiser said last week that he was investigating whether other officers in the chat violated the law.

Spokesperson Lawrence Pacheco said Weiser was presented with evidence of a “blatant violation of state law” and had to act.

""The attorney general has a duty to enforce state laws and protect Coloradans and he’ll continue to do so,” Pacheco said.

330,268,Jess Glynne calls White House deportation video with Jet2 song 'sick',https://ca.news.yahoo.com/jess-glynne-calls-white-house-100227073.html,31/07/2025 11:17,yahoo,GB,deportation,"Jess Glynne has said she feels ""sick"" that the White House has used the viral Jet2holiday advert featuring her song as the audio to a video promoting deportations.

The White House posted a clip on X on Wednesday showing handcuffed people being escorted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) onto a GlobalX flight.

Jet2's advert featuring Glynne's 2015 single Hold my Hand, and a cheery voiceover saying ""nothing beats a Jet2 holiday"" - which has become a meme - is played over the video.

Advertisement Advertisement

Zoe Lister, the advert's voiceover actress, told the BBC she would ""never condone my voiceover being used"" to promote what she called ""Trump and his abhorrent policies"".

""The Jet2 meme has spread a lot of joy and humour around the world but the White House video shows that Trump has neither,"" she added.

Responding to the clip, Glynne said on Instagram that her music ""is about love, unity and spreading positivity - never about division or hate"".

The White House post on X was captioned: ""When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!""

It has been met by some with criticism - one user said the clip was ""embarrassing and unprofessional"", while another said that it ""shows a real lack of humanity"".

Others have praised Trump for his stance on immigration.

It's not the first time the Trump administration has posted memes on its social media account.

Earlier this month, an image with the president's face superimposed on Superman's face was shared on the account with the caption: ""Truth. Justice. The American Way. Superman Trump.""

A few weeks ago the administration posted on X saying: ""Nowhere in the constitution does it say we can't post banger memes.""

President Trump has recently committed $170bn for border and immigration enforcement, including $45bn for detention. ICE, a federal law enforcement agency, will see its funding grow by $76.5bn over five years.

'Politicians shouldn't use this'

The Jet2holiday advert, which went viral at the start of the summer, has been used in more than two million videos on TikTok.

People have used the audio to share funny and chaotic holiday videos - one of the most watched is of a woman on a rollercoaster who gets hit in the chest by a seagull.

The sound has also been put over disastrous moments such as plane fights, holiday mishaps and failed travel plans.

Lister has been working with Jet2holidays for a number of years and does all of the company's voiceovers, from the security announcements on the planes to the voice on the phone lines.

She previously told the BBC she loves the fact the advert has gone viral. Lister and Glynne recently met on Capital FM and the singer said the viral success of the advert was ""a massive surprise"".

""It's the most amazing thing to see though,"" she added.

Lister said she doesn't approve of politicians and similar public figures using the soundtrack.

""That's just not the vibe - it's meant to be funny and a way for people to share ridiculous things that happen to them.

Advertisement Advertisement

""Someone serious like a politician using it to push their political agenda is not something I agree with,"" she said earlier this month.

Lister said she can't believe the advert has gone viral and often hears people listening to the sound when she's out in public.

""It's hilarious that I'm now being booked for gigs and festivals, people can't get enough of it.""

The BBC has contacted Jet2 holidays for comment.

Glynne joins a list of musicians that have publicly opposed Trump using their music over the past years.

Last summer, Abba complained after their hits including The Winner Takes it All were played at one of Trump's presidential campaign rallies. They requested the videos be removed and taken down.

The estate of Sinéad O'Connor has also asked Trump to stop using her music at his political rallies. Her estate told the BBC O'Connor would have been ""disgusted, hurt and insulted"" by his use of her music.

Similarly, Adele distanced herself from the president in 2016 after he played Rolling In The Deep as his ""warm-up"" music and lawyers for Aerosmith star Steven Tyler sent Trump's campaign a cease-and-desist letter in 2015. After the he played the band's hit single Dream On at numerous rallies around the US.

The United States will impose 25% tariffs on Indian goods starting in August, Trump said on social media on Wednesday. Also, he added, ""they have always bought a vast majority of their military equipment from Russia, and are Russia's largest buyer of ENERGY, along with China, at a time when everyone wants Russia to STOP THE KILLING IN UKRAINE."" He said there will be ""a penalty"" for that.

Earlier this month, Trump warned Russia to stop its war in Ukraine or else its trading partners would be hit with 100% ""secondary tariffs."" That came as U.S. lawmakers have been working on a bill that would allow an even tougher punishment of up to 500% tariffs.

India is now the biggest customer of Russian crude oil by volume, according to data from Finland-based think tank the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. China remains the biggest buyer in terms of dollar amount.

Here is a look at how the threats could affect India, a major U.S. partner with one of Asia's largest economies.

""Double standards"" or negotiating tactic?

President Trump's threat against Russia and its trade partners has been met with defiance in New Delhi. Last week, Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said there were ""double standards"" in Trump's threats to punish Russia's trade partners. Misri did not elaborate, but it could be a reference to members of the European Union and others that continue to import fuel from Russia directly or indirectly.

Arun Sankar / AFP via Getty Images / AFP via Getty Images Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri speaks during a press briefing in New Delhi on May 10.

Yet analysts say India may not have much leverage. India enjoys a trade surplus with the U.S., which is India's biggest export market. Plus, a similar U.S. threat has worked in the past: During Trump's first presidency in 2019, India stopped importing oil from Iran after Trump imposed sanctions on Tehran over its nuclear program.

The threats to Moscow's trading partners might not cripple the Russian economy as the U.S. hopes, says Matt Gertken, chief geopolitical strategist at BCA Research, a U.S.-based investment research firm. After previous Western sanctions on Moscow over its war in Ukraine, he says, Russia created a ""shadow fleet"" of tankers — essentially third-party intermediaries — to deliver oil to its importers.

Gertken says Trump's secondary tariff threat is likely a negotiating tactic in the short term. And to avoid blowback, India is likely to capitulate — and could try to procure oil from the shadow fleet, as Bloomberg reports it has done in the past.

""After the initial statements of defiance, there will be business interests in India that would say, 'well, wouldn't it be better if we partly enforce these sanctions, got reprieve from the U.S. and negotiated a trade deal,' "" Gertken says. ""And then later we could deal with any issues that remain about not fully enforcing or not enforcing to the true spirit those Russian sanctions.""

India's imports of Russia's crude oil goes back decades

India increased imports as Russia offered oil at a discounted price after the Kremlin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Today, more than a third of the crude oil India imports is from Moscow. But as India's petroleum minister, Hardeep Singh Puri, recently pointed out, it also imports from nearly 40 other countries. ""I'm not worried at all,"" Puri said, referring to Trump's threat to impose secondary tariffs. ""If something happens, we will deal with it.""

Anindito Mukherjee / Bloomberg via Getty Images / Bloomberg via Getty Images Hardeep Singh Puri, India's oil minister, during the India Energy Week conference in New Delhi on Feb. 11.

The real damage, then, will be to the diplomatic ties between India and the U.S., says Anupam Manur, professor of economics at The Takshashila Institution, a Bengaluru-based think tank and public policy school.

""There was always a section of Indian society which said that the U.S. is India's best and most natural ally,"" Manur says. ""But increasingly, the U.S. keeps threatening India with sanctions where they are not aligned with India's interests.""

Many in India cheered after Trump was reelected to the White House. His ""friendship"" with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was expected to usher in a golden age of partnership against their common rival, China.

In recent months, many Indians were baffled by a number of the Trump administration's actions and claims. This year the U.S. has canceled Indian students' visas and deported Indian immigrants who lacked legal status in the U.S. in handcuffs. Trump contradicted India's government by claiming to have brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan, using trade negotiations as leverage.

Whether or not India stops trading with Russia, there's a risk of oil costs rising. And the average Indian consumer will likely bear the brunt at a time when there's a growing body of research saying most Indians have little money for discretionary spending.

Will this cost India's ""Teflon"" prime minister politically? Manur thinks not.

""Oil has always been understood as an external factor and something that the current government doesn't really have control over,"" he says. ""In India, parties lose elections because of onion prices, not oil.""

336,74,The Cuban migrant on hunger strike at Alligator Alcatraz: ‘It’s up to them to decide whether I live or die’,https://english.elpais.com/usa/2025-07-31/the-cuban-migrant-on-hunger-strike-at-alligator-alcatraz-its-up-to-them-to-decide-whether-i-live-or-die.html,31/07/2025 11:14,elpais,GB,deportation,"Pedro Lorenzo Concepción’s voice seems to be sinking, shipwrecked among the vast wetlands populated by mosquitoes, pythons and alligators that inhabit the Everglades. He picks up the phone from Alligator Alcatraz itself, the feared migrant detention center that the Republicans built in Florida’s backyard. Asked how he’s feeling, he answers that he is obviously not well; today marks nine days of his hunger strike.

“I feel weak, with a lot of heartburn,” says Pedro from the bottom bunk in the cell where he remains with 31 other inmates, some of whom help him get up, hand him a bottle of water, and open it for him, because his strength is running out, as much or more than his patience.

Four days ago he was taken to the hospital. His wife Daimarys Hernández, 40, found out because the partner of another detained migrant called to inform her. Scared, Daimarys immediately called almost every hospital in Miami, where she repeated the same questions: if they knew about him, a 44-year-old Cuban migrant detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and transferred to Alligator Alcatraz prison, who had refused to eat since July 22.

Every medical center responded that they had no news of a patient with those characteristics. They even denied his presence at Kendall Hospital, where she later learned Pedro had been handcuffed for three days while doctors tried to convince him to eat something. Pedro refused. He was offended when they suggested he drink a juice, now that “no one was watching.” He turned around and said, “Do you know why I can’t do that?” he now says, his voice cracking. “Because I have to respect myself and everyone who’s with me.”

This was the reason why he signed a document stating his intention not to receive any kind of assistance. “I don’t want food, I refuse any treatment. I didn’t even ask to be taken to the hospital, because I’m fighting for my family and all Cubans, and I belong where my people are, in prison, suffering the same hardship they are.”

A month before ICE arrested him, Pedro was nervous and agitated. He had seen more than once the images of officers detaining other Cubans in immigration courts or at traffic stops. Governor Ron DeSantis, a staunch ally of Donald Trump, has paved the way for collaboration with the federal government’s anti-immigrant offensive, which so far this year has accumulated more than 10,000 arrests in Florida alone and nearly 60,000 nationwide.

At 8 a.m. on July 8, Pedro and his wife showed up at the ICE office in Miramar, where he had routinely been showing up since a legal problem stripped him of his permanent residency and landed him in jail. More than 10 years ago, he was convicted of guarding a house with marijuana crops and later of serving as a chauffeur for people involved in credit card theft.

The United States tried to deport him twice, but Cuba never accepted him back. For some time now, he had been “calm.” He built a family. That morning, in Miramar, Daimarys waited for him outside the ICE office. Time passed, and her husband didn’t come out. Others walked out, but not him. Suddenly, Daimarys received a call from ICE on her phone. It was Pedro.

“My love, my love, I love you, I’m staying here, I love you, take care of yourself,” he told her. And Daymarys, who recounted the story and couldn’t stop crying, felt her heart clench in her throat. They’d known each other since 2006, ever since he, after two failed attempts, arrived by sea on a raft from Cuba. They have two children, whom they’ve raised and watched grow up. “In a minute, your life falls apart,” she says. “It’s been 19 years of being together.”

“I can’t live like this anymore.”

Pedro barely sleeps, perhaps two or three hours during the long, swampy Everglades nights. “Since I’ve been on hunger strike, I wake up a lot,” he says haltingly. Then he stops, gathers his strength, and continues: “When I lie on my back, it’s like I have a 50-pound (22 kg) weight on top of me; my stomach hurts. I deal with it and say I’m fine, but I’m not.”

In his cell, he has collapsed twice, and his fellow inmates have had to rush to help him up. The days are already taking their toll on his body, and no authority has come forward to find out much more, he says. Sometimes an officer stops and asks how he feels, only when his fellow inmates warn them that Pedro is getting worse. Yesterday, seeing his pale complexion and his pale, dry lips, they led him to the Alligator Alcatraz infirmary and checked his blood pressure. Then he returned to the cell he once imagined himself in.

The day after his arrest, when he confirmed his whereabouts to his wife, he said, “I’m where I told you they were going to bring me.” It was what he feared, and what many in Florida fear: ending up in the place that has become the fiercest and most symbolic face of Trump’s anti-immigrant crusade. A place erected in just eight days on a former airstrip west of Miami, built with tents, trailers, and wire fences, ignoring any environmental demands and right under the noses of the Miccosukee tribe, which has denounced the desecration of “sacred” lands.

In the words of Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier, Alligator Alcatraz is the place where “if someone escapes, there’s not much waiting for them except alligators and pythons.” The multi-million-dollar facility run by the State of Florida, which has the capacity to house approximately 5,000 beds—at a cost of $245 per day each—was designed to be a “rapid processing center.” That is, to facilitate the almost instant deportation of arriving migrants, of which, so far, there are no more than 1,000. At least 100 people have already been deported from the facility.

But Pedro says that if anything really tested his patience, it was realizing that the days go by and no one tells him what will happen to them. During this time, he could lose his job at AVS, an audiovisual services company, and he could be separated from his family. He no longer has control over almost anything, but he does have control over his body. That’s why he decided to go on a hunger strike.

“I’m no longer the master of my life on the streets. ICE can pick me up whenever they want, when they open a new prison. ICE is the one who decides my life,” he says. “And since my life no longer belongs to me, it’s up to them to decide whether I live or die. Because I’m not doing anything by going out onto the streets and continuing to live in this uncertainty, wondering if they’ll pick me up next year. They’re playing with people’s lives. They’re not considering the consequences of taking away a person’s freedom.”

Pedro has felt helpless seeing himself like this, in those cells, treated like a criminal. He remembers the day he arrived at the prison, where they bound his hands and feet and left him on the floor for more than 10 hours. He complains about the same things others have complained about: they don’t have a clock to tell time, they’re only allowed to shower three times a week, with no privacy, they sleep with the lights on 24/7, COVID-19 has spread like wildfire in the center, and there’s a lack of hygiene. A few days ago, the toilets in one cell overflowed, covering the space with feces. The officers took the inmates out, waited for the excrement to dry, and then put them back in.

“I can’t live like this anymore,” says Pedro.

A desperate family

During a call on Tuesday, Daimarys told Pedro she wanted to put one of her sons on the phone. When the boy heard his father, he asked, “Dad, aren’t they giving you food? Why aren’t you eating?” Pedro couldn’t answer, so he asked to talk to his mother right away. “He didn’t have the courage to talk to the boy anymore,” Daimarys says.

The mother struggled to explain to her children why their father isn’t home, why ICE had taken him away. She told them that Pedro had made a mistake in the past, and that now being punished for it once again. “It’s hard to tell your children that he’s doing things right and that he’s still paying,” she says. “If you made a mistake and paid for it, why does it still haunt you years later? And how long are you going to have to keep paying for something you already paid for?”

Pedro has told his wife he doesn’t want to talk to anyone else except her, whom he misses so much. Daimarys, in her job as a manicurist, sometimes has to bow her head so clients don’t see her tears. When she talks to Pedro, whom she can tell is tired, she always asks him to please eat.

“I’m scared. I try to convince him every day. I’d rather he be okay and alive, even if they deport him anywhere in the world, but okay,” she says. “But he tells me he’s already made his decision, that I shouldn’t ask him that anymore. He doesn’t want to be separated from me or his children, or be sent somewhere else. That would break up a family.”

337,38,"A majority of ICE arrests in Trump's first 5 months took place in border and Southern states, figures show",https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ice-arrests-border-and-southern-states/,31/07/2025 10:00,cbsnews,GB,mass migration,"ICE arrests up 120% under Trump compared to Biden in 2024, most arrests in Southern states

Most of the more than 109,000 arrests carried out by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the first five months of President Trump's second term took place in border and Southern states, according to a CBS News analysis of government data.

States in the southern U.S., as well as those along the border with Mexico, saw the highest levels of ICE arrests between the start of Mr. Trump's second term on Jan. 20 and June 27, the figures show.

That continued a trend that predates the current administration, though ICE arrests have increased sharply across the country since last year. During the same time period in 2024, under the Biden administration, ICE made over 49,000 arrests, meaning that arrests by the agency have increased by 120% under the Trump administration.

The statistics indicate that Texas saw nearly a quarter of all ICE arrests during that time period. About 11% of ICE arrests occurred in Florida and 7% in California, followed by 4% in Georgia and 3% in Arizona. ICE made the fewest arrests in Vermont, Alaska and Montana, about 100 total apprehensions combined.

The locations of a small percentage of the arrests could not be discerned from the dataset, which was obtained by a group known as the Deportation Data Project through litigation.

Overall, the individuals arrested by ICE between Jan. 20 and June 27 came from nearly 180 countries, but most were from Latin America or the Caribbean, according to the data.

Mexico was the most common country of citizenship, with nearly 40,000 of those taken into ICE custody listed as Mexican citizens. Nationals of Guatemala and Honduras followed with around 15,000 and 12,000, respectively. Nearly 8,000 were citizens of Venezuela and over 5,000 of El Salvador.

Immigration experts said the concentration of arrests in Southern and border states is not necessarily surprising and can largely be attributed to geography, demographics and the extent to which local law enforcement agencies cooperate with ICE.

Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, explained that ICE tends to focus its resources in areas where local policies permit law enforcement interaction with federal immigration authorities, such as Texas and Florida. Other places, like California, may also see high levels of ICE arrests because they have large communities of immigrants, including those in the U.S. illegally, even though state and local policies limit collaboration with ICE.

""It's easier for ICE to be picking people up from state and local jails where there's cooperation,"" Bush-Joseph said. In cities and states with so-called sanctuary policies, ""ICE has to spend more resources picking up people for at-large arrests,"" she added.

Bush-Joseph also noted the countries of origin for those arrested by ICE align with broader immigration trends. ""Generally, we're talking about countries that are geographically close"" to the U.S., she said.

Latin American and Caribbean immigrants accounted for 84% of all unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. in 2023, according to a recent report from the Migration Policy Institute.

ICE is responsible for arresting, detaining and deporting immigrants living in the U.S. illegally, as well as other noncitizens who lose their legal status, including because of criminal activity. The agency has been given a sweeping mandate by Mr. Trump, tasked with carrying out his campaign promise of overseeing the largest mass deportation effort in American history.

Under the Trump administration, ICE has reversed Biden-era limits on arrests in the interior of the country and allowed deportation agents to arrest a broader group of individuals, including those who are in the U.S. illegally but who lack a criminal record.

Todd Lyons, the acting ICE director, told CBS News recently that while his agents are still prioritizing the arrest of violent offenders who are in the U.S. illegally, anyone found to be in the country in violation of federal immigration law will be taken into custody.

Halfway into Mr. Trump's first year back in the White House, ICE recorded 150,000 deportations, putting the agency on track to carry out the most removals since the Obama administration, over a decade ago, CBS News reported.

339,268,"Geoff Russ: Sorry, progressives, Canada wasn't 'built on slavery' like the U.S.",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/geoff-russ-sorry-progressives-canada-100012899.html,31/07/2025 10:00,yahoo,GB,mass migration,"Spurred on by the so-called reckonings over racism in the United States and its legacy of slavery, many Canadian activists have attempted to import America’s divisive racial politics into Canada. However, examining slavery in Canada on its own terms and in good faith does not result in an identical discourse.

A report released Wednesday by the Aristotle Foundation for Public Policy — titled, “Slavery in Canada: The Facts Rarely Told” — is a fascinating and grim study into the country’s dark history of trafficking in human beings.

Unsurprisingly, the reality of slavery in Canada greatly differed from the U.S. It was far less akin to the American original sin of mass chattel slavery, and fits more squarely within “Indigenous ways of knowing,” a phrase eagerly promoted by the federal government.

Indeed, slavery did not arrive in North America with the Europeans. They merely added their own method of this vile trade to the one that already existed here.

As the Aristotle Foundation has documented, vast Indigenous slave networks sent people to New France “from as far away as the Missouri River basin, Upper Mississippi, the Great Lakes and Chesapeake Bay.”

It was a nexus driven by the desire for wealth, weapons and political power on the part of both the colonists and the Indigenous nations.

Captives seized in war were the most readily available source of slaves for these Indigenous powers. The Aristotle Foundation found that 65 per cent of the slaves in colonial New France were Indigenous, stolen and traded along long-existing routes plied by the Huron, Iroquois and others.

This is a deeply uncomfortable truth that should not be sanitized. If the same criteria for critiquing colonial societies are applied to First Nations, then dozens of Indigenous cultures were “built on slavery.”

Long after the British Empire formally abolished the practice in 1834, it survived among First Nations far longer than is commonly understood.

The Aristotle Foundation’s report specifically mentions Maquinna, the Nuu-chah-nulth chief who resided at Nootka Sound on Vancouver Island. In 1803, following a misunderstanding with the captain of an English trading vessel, Maquinna orchestrated the murder of the entire crew save for two white men. Both were enslaved for over two years before they escaped, living among Indigenous slaves.

Far from being isolated to the Nuu-chah-nulth, the entire Pacific Coast was a hotbed of slavery both before and after Confederation.

The Haida Chief Albert Edward Eda’nsa was born in 1810. When he married in 1850, he owned 12 slaves and received 10 more as a dowry from his bride’s father.

In 1883, Eda’nsa still held human beings in bondage. This was 12 years after British Columbia entered Confederation, 18 years after the end of the American Civil War and half a century after the British Empire abolished slavery.

Chief Eda’nsa was one of the last people in the history of North America to have been a slaveholder. Nonetheless, the widespread practice of slavery among First Nations does not absolve the white colonists.

As detailed by the Aristotle Foundation, there was a noticeable uptick in the acquisition of slaves from Indigenous suppliers by the start of the 18th century in New France. In 1725, “fully half of all colonists who owned a home” in Montreal’s commercial district owned an Indigenous slave.

In total, the number of slaves in New France constituted as much as five per cent of the colony’s population. There were also slaves of African descent, though they were smaller in number than their Indigenous counterparts.

A study led by historian Marcel Trudel that was published in 1960 estimated that no more than 4,185 slaves lived in what became Lower Canada from the mid-1600s to 1834, when slavery was abolished in the British Empire.

There was slavery in the English-speaking colonies, as well. According to the Aristotle report, following the War of Independence in the U.S., up to 3,200 Black slaves were brought into Upper Canada and the Maritimes.

Together with the 3,000 Black Loyalists who migrated to British North America, they formed communities that are among the oldest in Canada.

They had to face crude bigotry from white residents in places like Shelburne, N.S., where race riots over labour competition broke out. That should not be swept under the rug.

However, an examination of our history of slavery will uncover the inevitable truth that Canada was simply not defined by chattel slavery in the way that the U.S. was. While 10-million people were enslaved in the U.S. from 1619 to 1865, the combined number of slaves in Canada over that period was no more than 7,500.

The biggest impact that chattel slavery had on Canada was how it helped spark the American Civil War, which became a motivation for Confederation in 1867.

The numbers and longevity of Indigenous slavery made it the most impactful form of human trafficking in Canada’s history. Is that what advocates had in mind when they declared that the American reckoning with slavery had to be emulated in Canada?

No matter how hard some people wish Canada had been “built on slavery” like the U.S., the assertion is not backed up by the historical record. Slavery did not shape the economic, political or cultural identity of Canada in the way that it moulded the Americans.

The inability or unwillingness to revisit slavery in Canada on its own terms speaks volumes about the ignorance of many on the progressive left.

It is true that the cultural power of the U.S. makes it very difficult to avoid American narratives, but that does not excuse the inauthentic imposition of a foreign history upon our own.

The Conservative Political Action Conference, a gathering of right-wing activists and elected officials that started in the United States, has gone global, hosting mega-events in Brazil, Argentina and Hungary. Foreign leaders, including Argentina President Javier Milei and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele, have raced the stage at CPAC, slamming socialism, calling for tougher policies on crime and railing against all things “woke.”

Now, the left is trying to compete.

This week, political leaders, activists and strategists from a dozen countries across the Americas gather in Mexico City for what organizers are billing as the “CPAC of the left.”

The second annual Panamerican Congress includes a diverse range of participants, from a guerrilla-fighter-turned-politician from Colombia to U.S. Reps. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) and Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.).

The event’s program acknowledges that leftists have not been in conversation across borders in the way the right has, and vows to “remedy this crisis of hemispheric coordination.”

In closed-door meetings and public events, participants will seek to address hemispheric themes such as migration, climate change and Trump’s tariff threats. And they will debate existential questions: With elections looming across the region, what are winning strategies for the left? And how can it combat the growing influence of conservative, anti-establishment populists who are both inspired by — and influencing — the American right?

“We need solutions not only at the individual country level, but also at the continental level,” said Giorgio Jackson, an event organizer who served as minister of social development under Chilean President Gabriel Boric. “We need broad, democratic, progressive alliances.”

Chile’s upcoming presidential election highlights just how much the ideological landscape of the Americas has shifted. Just a handful of years ago, the left was ascendant, with its candidates winning presidencies in one country after the other: Mexico, Argentina, Bolivia, Peru, Chile, Colombia and Brazil.

Boric, a former student protest leader who was just 36 when he took office, embodied the trend, which some christened a “new pink tide,” likening it to the period in the 2000s when Brazil’s Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and Bolivia’s Evo Morales dominated regional politics.

Boric campaigned on a promise that Chile would be the “grave” of free-market orthodoxy and promoted a new constitution that would enshrine gender equality, environmental protections and Indigenous rights.

But a national referendum on the constitution failed. And amid a sluggish economy and growing fears about organized crime and high levels migration from nearby Venezuela, his approval rating has slumped to less than 30%.

Conservative José Antonio Kast, a Trump acolyte who has vowed hard-line security policies, is now leading in the polls for Chile’s November presidential election.

Vowing to fight crime has been a winning strategy for the right across the region, from Ecuador, where conservative President Daniel Noboa has declared war on organized crime, to El Salvador, where Bukele’s mass incarceration of alleged gang members has brought down violence even while sparking concerns about violations of human rights.

“Polls in most countries suggest populations want harsh crackdowns,” said James Bosworth, the founder of Hxagon, a company that provides political risk analysis in Latin America. A strong hand — “mano dura” — is popular, he said.

The left, he said, needs to find a similarly powerful message.

It’s no coincidence that the conference is taking place in Mexico, where leftist President Claudia Sheinbaum won election last year in a landslide. Her Morena party holds a majority in both chambers of Congress and governs most states.

The party’s founder, former president Andrés Manuel López Obrador, was an economic populist, decrying the “mafia of power” that he said controlled Mexico and vowing to “put the poor first.”

Celeste Ascencio Ortega, a Morena congresswoman from Michoacán state, said other countries should consider replicating Morena’s popular welfare programs, which funnel state money to students and the elderly.

“We have to talk about an accumulation of wealth that benefits everyone, not just a few,” she said.

Economic populism has also proved to be a winning strategy in New York’s mayoral race, where Zohran Mamdani beat out establishment candidates in the Democratic primary by focusing on poverty and affordability.

But leftists coming into office in the hemisphere now are hamstrung by harsh economic conditions.

Long gone is the commodities boom that allowed Lula and others to spend generously. Today, inflation drives up food and fuel prices and the threat of a worldwide recession looms.

Leftists also must contend with the aggressive politics of the region’s global superpower.

President Trump has cracked down on migration and has repeatedly threatened nations across Latin America with tariffs, recently saying he’d levy 50% taxes on imports from Brazil, citing a “witch hunt” against Jair Bolsonaro, the far-right former president, who is on trial for allegedly plotting a coup.

In Mexico, whose economy relies largely on exports to the U.S., Trump is threatening 30% tariffs on Mexican imports unless the country does more to combat drug trafficking and migration.

The new taxes are set to go into effect Friday, just as the congress meets in Mexico City. Perhaps to avoid antagonizing Trump by appearing alongside prominent Democrats, Sheinbaum will not be participating in the event, although she may formally welcome its guests, and prominent Morena party members will take part.

The left has suffered a number of losses recently. Kamala Harris lost to Trump. In Argentina, far-right firebrand Milei won on a promise to privatize much of government. Polls in Brazil suggest Lula is nowhere near as popular as he once was heading into next year’s presidential vote. .

But whether those shifts reflect real ideological changes in the region is up for debate.

Many see the pendulum swing from left to right as a feature of politics in the hemisphere, where voters often clamor for change. From to 2018 until 2023, some two dozen national elections went against the incumbent party.

“For approximately 15 years now, there are practically no goverments across the continent that have been reelected,” Jackson said. “These are very difficult conditions for any party.”

Significantly, there will be no representatives at this week’s event from Venezuela, Nicaragua or Cuba, countries with leftist leaders who have taken hard authoritarian turns.

Bosworth said it was incumbent on the left to address those repressive governments, particularly Venezuela, where more than 6 million people have fled political, economic and humanitarian crises in recent years.

“Venezuela is the great failure of the left in Latin America, and it struggles to move beyond that,” he said. “If this movement is going to do anything, they can’t ignore the fact that Venezuela exists.”",NewsData.io,-6.26,,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.77,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/la-times/,https://ground.news/interest/los-angeles-times,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/los-angeles-times-media-bias,LEAST BIASED (1.5),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Left,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,latimes.com,,latimes,47,USA,,,,

The Hazaras: An Overlooked Humanitarian Crisis in Afghanistan

In a world overwhelmed by ongoing global humanitarian crises, the suffering of the Hazaras remains largely invisible to many. The ethno-religious group native to Central Asia has faced systematic persecution, targeted violence, and mass killings for over two centuries, making it one of the most persecuted groups in Afghanistan. The Hazaras have been repeatedly targeted by a range of regimes and nonstate actors, including the country’s current de facto rulers, the Taliban.

This spotlight piece is meant to bring attention to their plight and will be followed by a New Lines Institute investigative report on the historic and ongoing genocide against the Hazaras, set to be published in the coming months.

Who Are the Hazaras?

The Hazaras are concentrated primarily in Afghanistan, where they make up about 20% of the population. Of their global population of 14 million, 8 million to 10 million live in Afghanistan. Historical migration, forced displacement, and ethnic cleansing have pushed smaller populations of Hazaras into Iran and Pakistan, with diaspora groups distributed throughout the Western world.

Historically, the Hazaras were highland farmers and seminomadic people living in the rugged mountainous regions of central Afghanistan. They built fortified villages of flat-roofed homes and practiced subsistence farming under a feudal system before the 1880s. The Hazaras maintained control over the Hazaristan region in central Afghanistan until that time, when the central government in Kabul forcibly revoked their autonomy.

Hazaras are often characterized by their distinct Asiatic features, their use of Hazaragi (a dialect of Farsi), and their predominantly Shia Muslim faith – factors that have long set them apart from other major ethnic groups in Afghanistan. Their religious and ethnic identity has made them the target of persistent sectarian and state-sponsored violence and political scapegoating, especially in Afghanistan, where Sunni Islam dominates.

In the 19th century, during a brutal campaign led by Abdur Rahman Khan, the emir of Kabul, more than half of the Hazara population was massacred. Ever since, they have endured mass killings, discrimination, and marginalization, and have been subjected to arbitrary arrests, torture, forced conversion from Shia to Sunni Islam, sexual violence, and systematic displacement at the hands of a succession of Afghan rulers.

The Taliban’s Influence and Continued Persecution

In August 2021, the Taliban took control of the country, becoming its de facto rulers after internationally backed President Ashraf Ghani fled amid the withdrawal of NATO and U.S. troops. The legitimacy of the Taliban government is not internationally recognized, and U.N. travel bans and sanctions targeting Taliban leaders have been entirely ineffective in stopping human rights violations in the country.

The Taliban, who enforces a harsh interpretation of Sharia, impose draconian restrictions on women and girls. Their rule is marked by arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances, widespread gender-based violence, unlawful killings, obstruction of humanitarian aid, and public executions. To top it off, they have denied entry to the U.N. special rapporteur on Afghanistan.

Women and girls, specifically, face sweeping restrictions under Taliban rule, including bans on secondary and higher education; access to gyms, parks, public baths, and other public spaces; participation in sports and media; most public-sector employment; and work with nongovernmental organizations. They are also prohibited from traveling without a male guardian, speaking publicly, or driving, and they must wear full-body coverings. Naturally, they are banned from protesting any of these conditions.

The U.N. has hesitated (with lots of “may amount tos”) to officially call the Taliban’s treatment of women and girls what it is: gender apartheid.

Triple Persecution for Hazara Women and Girls

Since the Taliban takeover, Shia-Hazaras have faced escalating violence affecting places of worship, schools, workplaces, and daily life. They are excluded from the Taliban’s government and are subjected to systemic economic marginalization and widespread religious discrimination. Terrorist attacks and mass killings targeting the community have become more commonplace. In the three years since the Taliban reassumed power, at least 61 attacks against Hazaras have been documented. Of these, Taliban forces committed 12, with 16 by the Islamic State/Daesh. The perpetrators of the rest remain unknown. The Taliban have forcibly displaced an estimated 25,000 Hazaras during this time.

Hazara women and girls exist at a triple axis of persecution of their ethnic identity, religious affiliation, and gender. Attacks under the Taliban have deliberately targeted women and symbols of womanhood; in September 2022, 54 women, most of whom were Hazara, were killed in the bombing of the Kaaj Education Center. In May 2020, 24 Hazara women (including pregnant women and newborns) were slaughtered in an attack on the a maternity ward in Dasht-e Barchi.

Gaining International Attention & Support

Finally in 2025 the plight of the Hazara people is beginning to receive some international attention. As part of the U.N. Human Rights Council meetings in June, New Lines Institute participated in the event called Triple Persecution: Hazara Women at the Crossroads of Gender, Ethnic, and Religious Persecution in Afghanistan, sharing details of our forthcoming report that presents a rigorous legal and archival analysis of the ongoing ethnic cleansing of the Hazara people.

This powerful and action-oriented event centered local voices while demanding concrete measures, safeguards, and, most critically, long-overdue recognition of the Hazaras’ suffering. Participants demanded decisive action from member states and the United Nations, but the event’s overarching theme was the urgent need for acknowledgement. The emphasis was on raising awareness, validating the Hazara experience, facilitating their access to refugee protections, and ensuring widespread understanding of the ongoing and persistent injustices against them.

To learn more about the Hazara, check out these resources, and stay tuned for New Lines’ report in the fall.

343,159,Christian refugees caught in the crosshairs of U.S. immigration policy,https://www.nhpr.org/2025-07-31/christian-refugees-caught-in-the-crosshairs-of-u-s-immigration-policy,31/07/2025 09:00,nhpr,GB,mass migration,"On a Sunday in June, Pastor Ara Torosian gave a message to his congregation in Los Angeles: If detained by immigration officers, ""first, call your lawyer, and second, call your pastor.""

It didn't take long. By the end of the month, two families reached out to Torosian, one through their lawyer and another through a spouse, to notify him they were being detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

""There are hundreds of Iranian Christians from different churches that are in danger of deportation,"" Torosian said. ""And if they go back to Iran, there's a big danger. Many, many of them will be in prison.""

Torosian has been advocating for the release from ICE custody of the Iranian members of his congregation, who entered the U.S. to escape religious persecution in their home country. According to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, Iranian authorities routinely target members of minority faith communities, especially Christians who converted from Islam.

One of the families in his congregation entered the U.S. with the app formerly known as CBP One, which under the Biden administration allowed migrants to schedule asylum appointments at legal ports of entry. The Trump administration this year shuttered that function of the app and told everyone who entered the country with the app to self-deport.

Torosian told NPR that one couple and their child were released from detention over the weekend, but they were placed in an alternative to detention program with an ankle monitor. The others, a couple, remain in separate detention facilities.

Religious persecution is one of the many reasons individuals can claim asylum or apply to be a refugee. But the Trump administration's overhaul of the U.S. asylum and refugee systems has taken a toll on people fleeing religious persecution — many of whom saw the U.S. as a symbol of religious freedom.

The pause on most refugee admissions and curbs on some asylum claims mark a shift from the administration's first term, which offered support for some Christian refugees, even while tightening immigration overall.

The White House says the president still supports Christians worldwide.

""President Trump has a humanitarian heart, and especially cares deeply for Christians around the world who are facing persecution for their faith. Any individual who fears persecution for religious reasons is able to apply for asylum to remain in the United States,"" said Abigail Jackson, a White House spokeswoman. ""The Trump administration is also working to undo the damage by the Biden administration, who admitted countless poorly vetted migrants into the United States through temporary programs.""

Jackson added that 13,000 individuals have been granted asylum since the start of the administration. During a similar period, the Biden administration approved roughly 18,000 asylum cases through immigration courts, according to data from Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse.

In May, Trump signed an executive order to establish a White House Religious Liberty Commission, focused on promoting ""America's founding principle of religious freedom.""

Prior to signing, he said: ""We're bringing religion back to our country and it's a big deal.""

Fleeing persecution

But the broader numbers of asylum approvals mask struggles for particular families, especially those who first entered the country under temporary programs.

An Afghan Christian in Oklahoma said last month he has been waiting more than six months for an update on his asylum application. The man, who declined to give his name for fear of persecution due to his immigration status, recalled fearing for his life after the Taliban took control in 2021.

Three years later, he and his family fled to Brazil and later traveled by foot and boat to the U.S.-Mexico border. They entered the U.S. through the CBP One app.

Although he hoped to feel safer in the U.S., the fear of deportation and potentially facing persecution in Afghanistan still haunts him.

"" My family and I, we can't sleep,"" he said. ""All the time, we are scared.""

Matthew Soerens, vice president of advocacy and policy for World Relief, a Christian humanitarian organization and refugee resettlement agency, said religion is often a big factor in persecution worldwide.

"" Everyone wants to stay home when they can, but often it reaches a point where people feel that they have no choice but to leave home,"" he said. ""And that is a tragedy, but it's even more tragic when then they have nowhere to go.""

By the end of last year, there were more than 10 million Christian immigrants in the U.S. vulnerable to deportation, whether because they have no legal status or their protections such as temporary protected status could be withdrawn, according to a report by World Relief and other Christian and immigration organizations.

The report notes that 8% of all Christians in the U.S., including Catholics and Evangelicals, are either personally at risk for deportation or are in a household with someone who is.

While it is difficult to quantify how many refugees are granted status because of religious persecution, Christian denominations made up the largest group among refugee arrivals in fiscal year 2024, according to the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.

"" Last year at least, and in most of the last several years, the majority of refugees we resettled happened to be Christians,"" Soerens said. ""More than half of them come from countries where Christians face persecution.""

Christians face religious-based violence in countries in the Middle East and Africa, according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in 2025.

Trump's immigration policies affect Christian immigrants

In addition to changes to refugee and asylum policies, advocates for Christian refugees and asylum-seekers have also expressed concern over the loss of temporary protected status for migrants from Afghanistan. The country is ranked among the most dangerous places for Christians, according to a watch list by Open Doors, a group that supports persecuted Christians.

Some of the administration's changes to the country's refugee and asylum systems have been challenged in court, including a suit brought by refugee resettlement groups over the administration's halt on refugee admissions and resettlement. A small group of refugees was recently allowed into the U.S. amid the legal challenges.

The stricter tone of the Trump administration's approach to immigration has also disheartened some people who believed there would be some exceptions to Trump's goals of mass deportation, ""because they had understood that he was going to champion the cause of persecuted Christians,"" World Relief's Soerens said.

Polling data shows more nuance. While some Christian organizations have protested against Trump's treatment of legal and illegal immigration, white Christians are among the groups most likely to approve of Trump's handling of immigration, according to a poll from the Public Religion Research Institute.

There have been slivers of opportunity. In June, the administration announced its new travel ban but included some exceptions, including immigrant visas for ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran.

Still, organizations are calling for broader protections. A group of faith leaders sent a letter and distributed petitions calling on the Trump administration to protect hundreds of Afghan Christians from deportation as their temporary protected status and other legal protections end.

Torosian, the pastor in Los Angeles, traveled to Washington, D.C., this month to conduct a silent prayer outside the White House and meet with Republican members of Congress to advocate for exceptions to Trump's deportation policies.

Ahead of his travels, he said he received hundreds of messages on social media from Iranian and other Christians fearing deportation.

""I came as a refugee here. So their pain is my pain right now. If they are in prison, in detention, I am in prison,"" Torosian said, noting that he sought refuge from Iran, in part, for religious persecution. ""I will not rest until they come back home.""

While it is difficult to quantify how many refugees are granted status because of religious persecution, Christian denominations made up the largest group among refugee arrivals in fiscal year 2024, according to the Department of State's Bureau of Population, Refugees and Migration.

"" Last year at least, and in most of the last several years, the majority of refugees we resettled happened to be Christians,"" Soerens said. ""More than half of them come from countries where Christians face persecution.""

Christians face religious-based violence in countries in the Middle East and Africa, according to the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom in 2025.

Trump's immigration policies affect Christian immigrants

In addition to changes to refugee and asylum policies, advocates for Christian refugees and asylum-seekers have also expressed concern over the loss of temporary protected status for migrants from Afghanistan. The country is ranked among the most dangerous places for Christians, according to a watch list by Open Doors, a group that supports persecuted Christians.

Some of the administration's changes to the country's refugee and asylum systems have been challenged in court, including a suit brought by refugee resettlement groups over the administration's halt on refugee admissions and resettlement. A small group of refugees was recently allowed into the U.S. amid the legal challenges.

The stricter tone of the Trump administration's approach to immigration has also disheartened some people who believed there would be some exceptions to Trump's goals of mass deportation, ""because they had understood that he was going to champion the cause of persecuted Christians,"" World Relief's Soerens said.

Polling data shows more nuance. While some Christian organizations have protested against Trump's treatment of legal and illegal immigration, white Christians are among the groups most likely to approve of Trump's handling of immigration, according to a poll from the Public Religion Research Institute.

There have been slivers of opportunity. In June, the administration announced its new travel ban but included some exceptions, including immigrant visas for ethnic and religious minorities facing persecution in Iran.

Still, organizations are calling for broader protections. A group of faith leaders sent a letter and distributed petitions calling on the Trump administration to protect hundreds of Afghan Christians from deportation as their temporary protected status and other legal protections end.

Torosian, the pastor in Los Angeles, traveled to Washington, D.C., this month to conduct a silent prayer outside the White House and meet with Republican members of Congress to advocate for exceptions to Trump's deportation policies.

Ahead of his travels, he said he received hundreds of messages on social media from Iranian and other Christians fearing deportation.

""I came as a refugee here. So their pain is my pain right now. If they are in prison, in detention, I am in prison,"" Torosian said, noting that he sought refuge from Iran, in part, for religious persecution. ""I will not rest until they come back home.""

If this park is constructed, which includes a dog park, who will pay for the maintenance and upkeep, which could be quite extensive?

The official told a local TV reporter at the scene what was about to happen. “He can either give us a license,” he said, “or we’ll smash the fucking window out and drag him out.” Then, as the driver refused to exit the car, officers broke the glass.

It was one of nearly 50 documented instances of immigration agents breaking vehicle windows that ProPublica has identified from social media, local news accounts, lawsuits and interviews since President Donald Trump took office six months ago. Using the same methods, we found just eight in the previous decade. Neither number is comprehensive. The government releases no relevant statistics.

Use-of-force experts and former Immigration and Customs Enforcement insiders say the tactic was rarely used during previous administrations. They say there is no known policy change greenlighting agents’ smashing of windows. Rather, it’s a part of a broader shattering of norms.

There are arrest quotas, and they are increasingly aggressive. “There’s been an emphasis placed on speed and numbers that did not exist before,” says Deborah Fleischaker, who served as ICE chief of staff under President Joe Biden.

Officers who break glass aren’t being disciplined — they’re being promoted. The official from Maryland, Matthew Elliston, now occupies a senior position at headquarters and oversees field operations on the East Coast. On the other side of the country, a Border Patrol chief who also embraced the tactic, Gregory Bovino, was put in charge of sweeps in Los Angeles. (Neither answered ProPublica’s questions.)

352,228,What to Do — And Not to Do — About Trump Judge Like Emil Bove,https://theintercept.com/2025/07/31/emil-bove-judge-courts-trump/,31/07/2025 09:00,theintercept,GB,illegal alien,"Emil Bove, the nominee to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, is sworn in before his confirmation hearing in the Senate on June 25, 2025, in Washington.

President Donald Trump’s second term has so far been a constant barrage of unconstitutional actions and illegal orders. So it was thus no surprise when the Senate on Monday confirmed Trump’s former personal lawyer and Justice Department lackey, Emil Bove, to a lifetime appointment on the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.

That 50 Republican senators would install this fascist bootlicker to one of the most powerful judicial positions in the land for life is, as MSNBC legal analyst Andrew Weissmann put it, “a nail in the coffin” for a system of checks and balances on authoritarian presidential overreach.

There’s a risk, however, after a grave blow like this to legal, political, and constitutional norms, that liberal epitaphs to the American constitutional order will mourn the wrong thing.

Bove’s appointment confirms something worse than the Republican embrace of lawlessness. He represents the Republicans’ use and abuse of our fraught constitutional order for the purposes of enacting profound, life-denying, and long-lasting injustices to uphold a white nationalist regime.

Liberal epitaphs to the American constitutional order risk mourning the wrong thing.

Calling on the restoration of preexisting norms of law and constitutionality to reverse course will be, at best, insufficient. After all, liberal reliance on a system of order above justice helped deliver us Trump and his jurist enablers in the first place.

This is not to understate how appalling it is that Bove has been appointed a federal judge.

“It is one thing to put lab-designed Federalist Society members on courts across the country — and, to be clear, several of Trump’s nominees from his first administration went far beyond that,” wrote legal journalist Chris Geidner when Trump nominated Bove, “but it is another thing altogether to name a lawless loyalist to a federal appeals court.”

Geidner called Bove’s confirmation a “line that cannot be crossed.” It has now been crossed.

Bove is perhaps best known as the Justice Department official who dismissed corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams — a decision that led more than 10 Justice Department attorneys to resign in protest. He fired federal prosecutors who had worked on January 6 cases.

According to three Justice Department whistleblower accounts, Bove also told federal attorneys that they “would need to consider telling the courts ‘fuck you’” and ignore orders blocking the administration from sending immigrants to El Salvador’s gulag. Over 900 former Justice Department attorneys, identifying with both parties, wrote letters opposing Bove’s judgeship.

Yet Republican senators refused to hear whistleblower testimony and dismissed the widespread concerns about Bove as Democratic meddling. As usual, they did what the president asked.

Democrats’ Role

Bove’s new, permanent position assures more serious harms to come. Given how few cases are heard by the Supreme Court, the 3rd Circuit is most often the final voice in the law for cases from Delaware, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.

Bove has made unwaveringly clear that, for him, the law is the president’s will. This position is now standard in the Republican Party and all too consistently affirmed by a Supreme Court majority committed to unitary executive theory to vest authoritarian powers in Trump’s hands.

Earlier this month, Geidner posted on social media that “should Bove be confirmed — which he should not be — he should immediately be the subject of an impeachment inquiry should Dems retake Congress.”

Based on his actions at the Department of Justice, there are ample grounds to call for impeachment. Democrats should vow to do this immediately.

Senate Democrats carry significant blame for Bove’s judgeship, too.

Senate Democrats, after all, carry significant blame for Bove’s judgeship, too. His seat should have been filled by Biden nominee, Adeel Mangi, who would have been the first Muslim judge on a federal appeals court. Instead of shutting down vile, Islamophobic Republican attacks against Mangi, Senate Democrats allowed the smears to gain ground and eventually stood down on the nomination.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday said, “To confirm Mr. Bove is a sacrilegious act against our democracy.”

He did not mention that, when he was Senate majority leader, he permitted a relentless Islamophobic campaign to tank Mangi, a qualified nominee, which left the judge’s seat open for Trump’s taking.

The Democratic establishment may lament Bove’s confirmation as “a dark, dark day,” but we have no reason to think that this party leadership will bring us toward the light. Geidner’s suggestion — to pursue impeachment — would be the very least that Democrats can do. What they should already be doing is using every tool in their power to hinder Trump’s deportation machine.

Given the Democrats’ own vile embrace of harsh border rule, I am not holding my breath.

Not Our Savior

The judges who have continued to push back directly against Trump’s illegal actions, meanwhile, remain a crucial constraint on some of the administration’s worst assaults on our rights. These judges are under unprecedented attack.

On the same day Bove was confirmed, Trump’s Justice Department filed a baseless misconduct complaint against U.S. District Judge James Boasberg. In March, Boasberg issued an order to block deportation flights to El Salvador under Trump’s invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act — the very sort of order that Bove reportedly told attorneys to say “fuck you” to.

In an obscene retaliatory escalation, the Justice Department’s complaint claims that Boasberg’s alleged comments — that the administration could trigger a “constitutional crisis” by disregarding court orders — “have undermined the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary.” The complaint says that the administration has “always complied with all court orders.”

The idea that it constitutes judicial misconduct to suggest otherwise, despite clear evidence of the executive’s disregard for certain unfavorable court orders, is the sort of authoritarian logic that obviates concerns about a constitutional crisis in the worst way: There can be no crisis if fascist rule silences all constitutional pushback.

Then the problem is not a constitutional order in crisis, but a fascist order without opposition.

This is not yet the state of affairs. The courts — certain courts, at least — are not yet a dead end. It should be increasingly clear, however, that they will not deliver us from fascism either.

As legal scholar Aziz Rana wrote earlier this year, the left should “strongly back litigation efforts and condemn Trump’s defiance of the courts,” but not because the courts are a terrain of liberatory struggle.

Rana is clear that “the reason to oppose Trump’s violation of court orders is not out of a general faith in judges or constitutional norms,” but because they are a tool, however limited, for protecting people and holding the administration to account.

“Fuck You” to Humanity

The affront at the heart of Bove’s confirmation is not that he does not respect the law — although that should no doubt be disqualifying for a judge. If that’s where we object, however, we risk lionizing a criminal legal system that also gives rise to racist policing and mass incarceration.

Bove’s violence lies primarily in his commitment to a form of injustice that ensures impunity for the corrupt and powerful, while the poorest and most vulnerable are treated as wholly disposable.

The infamous advice Bove allegedly gave to ignore court orders over deportations was a “fuck you” to the Constitution and the rule of law, yes, but above all it was a “fuck you” to the over 200 men who were rounded up, kidnapped, shaved, beaten, and tortured in a foreign gulag without any recourse. It was a “fuck you” to human beings.

It should go without saying that the constitutional order in and of itself has never in practice guaranteed equality and justice for all. The constitutionalization of slavery’s abolition and many basic civil rights protections took extraordinary social struggle and political work. The successful dismantling of the constitutional right to an abortion took decades of political organizing, too. Nothing in the Constitution guarantees progress.

“The great social movements of the past, from abolition to civil rights, labour to women’s suffrage, famously called for the defiance of unjust court judgments that sustained slavery, segregation and disenfranchisement, or criminalized union organizing,” Rana noted. “Considering the current right-wing control over the courts, the left may find itself in a similar place in the coming years, calling for civil disobedience of judicial authority.”

With judges like Bove in place, such action will likely be all the more necessary.",NewsData.io,-14.02,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,37.39,"theintercept, TheIntercept.com, Intercept  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-intercept/,https://ground.news/interest/the-intercept,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/intercept,LEFT (-6.8),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.4),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Left,"First Look Media, Pierre Omidyar",2014,-3.6,Left,High,Left,Left,Left,Left,Left,theintercept.com,,theintercept,6,USA,,,,
353,164,Federal Appeals Court To Hear Arguments in Case That Could Determine Fate of ‘Liberation Day’ Tariffs,https://www.nysun.com/article/court-hear-arguments-case-could-determine-fate-trumps-liberation-day-tariffs,31/07/2025 07:55,nysun,GB,illegal alien,"The future of one of the president’s signature policies hangs in the balance as his ‘reciprocal tariffs’ are supposed to take effect on August 1.

The future of one of the core pillars of President Trump’s economic policy hangs in the balance as a federal appeals court hears oral arguments Thursday to decide whether he can use an emergency authority to unilaterally impose so-called reciprocal tariffs.

In February, Mr. Trump said he would impose tariffs on China, Canada, and Mexico, calling the flow of fentanyl into America a national emergency that can only be tackled via the import taxes. In April, he announced his “Liberation Day” 10 percent global baseline tariffs, saying trade deficits also are a national emergency. Those tariffs are set to take effect on August 1.

The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which has jurisdiction over international trade matters, will hear arguments as it weighs whether the president has the authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 to impose the tariffs.

The Constitution gives Congress the power to impose tariffs. However, lawmakers can and have delegated some tariff authority to the president in recent years.

One of the questions surrounding the 1977 law, which gives the president the ability to impose economic sanctions to respond to “unusual and extraordinary” threats to America’s “national security, foreign policy, or economy,” is whether it gives the president the ability to impose tariffs.

Mr. Trump is the first president to try to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to impose tariffs.

In a filing, the Department of Justice argued that lawmakers “meant for the president to use his IEEPA powers as a tool to create leverage, just as Congress and the president have long done in other international-trade contexts.”

The administration has also argued that there is “no basis” for a “meaningful judicial review of President Trump’s findings” that there is an “extraordinary and unusual threat” necessitating the tariffs.

However, in May, a three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of International Trade ruled that the IEEPA does not give the president “unbounded” authority to impose tariffs.

“An unlimited delegation of tariff authority would constitute an improper abdication of legislative power to another branch of government,” the court said. “Regardless of whether the court views the president’s actions through the nondelegation doctrine, through the major questions doctrine, or simply with separation of powers in mind, any interpretation of IEEPA that delegates unlimited tariff authority is unconstitutional.”

The Trump administration appealed the ruling to the Federal Circuit, which put the lower court’s ruling on hold.

Twelve Democrat-run states and five small businesses involved in the case argue that the IEEPA gives the president no authority to impose tariffs. Instead, they say the law only refers to measures such as embargoes and similar sanctions.

Several conservative think tanks, including Advancing American Freedom, filed amicus briefs in the case arguing that Mr. Trump’s interpretation violates the nondelegation doctrine, which states that Congress cannot delegate its legislative authority to another branch of government. A libertarian think tank, the Cato Institute, wrote in an amicus brief that the IEEPA gives the president the authority to adjust tariff rates once they are passed by Congress. However, it said the law does not give the president the authority to impose them unilaterally without congressional authorization.

Meanwhile, the American Enterprise Institute argued in its brief that trade imbalances do not constitute an emergency, and that tariffs would not be an effective measure to counter them anyway.

It is expected that whichever side loses at the Federal Circuit will appeal to the Supreme Court.

One argument that might add to the drama surrounding the decision is that the Trump administration argues that even if the court rules against the tariffs, they should not be blocked nationally due to the Supreme Court’s decision limiting nationwide injunctions.

If the court rules in Mr. Trump’s favor, it could give him broad authority to use emergency powers to implement his economic agenda.

In his second term, Mr. Trump has frequently sought to claim emergency powers to swiftly carry out his agenda. In the spring, the federal government sought to use the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to bypass the standard review process and quickly deport Venezuelan illegal immigrants who the administration claimed were members of a gang. However, the Supreme Court blocked the administration from using the law because of concerns that the migrants were not receiving due process.

Maura Healey announced Friday that the final hotel shelters in Massachusetts have closed, and she has formally terminated the emergency declaration she issued in August of 2023.

“When we took office, families were being placed in hotels all across the state, and families were staying in shelter for months – sometimes years – at a time. There was no plan in place to reform the shelter system to handle the surge in demand, protect taxpayer dollars or help families leave shelter. We can all agree that a hotel is no place to raise a family. So we took action,” Healey said in a statement. “As a result of my reforms and our efforts to help families get jobs and stable housing, we have fewer families in shelter than the day we took office, and all hotel shelters are now closed – months ahead of schedule. We’re saving taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars and putting families on a path to self-sustainability.”

The state had previously shut down 24 shelters in June, leaving only four of them operating in July.

In addition to hotels, Healey said the Norfolk Rapid Shelter located at the former Bay State Correctional Center and the Chelsea Rapid Shelter sites have shut down.

Emergency shelters in Massachusetts hotels for migrants have been a point of contention for years, with concerns ranging from safety to financial, but the shelters have been really the only landing place for new arrivals seeking to build a better life in the state.

Soon after she took office, Healey declared a state of emergency and imposed a cap on the system at 7,500 families in 2023. Without a cap, she said the caseload was projected to have reached 13,000 families by the summer of 2024.

The governor also worked with the Legislature to reform the Right to Shelter law to implement a six-month length of stay limit, require proof of Massachusetts residency and require that all family members had lawful immigration status, with limited exemptions.

All 32 hotel shelters in Massachusetts will close this summer, which could impact thousands of families. We spoke with a woman living in one of the facilities, who said it's not a great place to live, as well as Gov. Maura Healey and State Auditor Diana DiZoglio, who released a new audit of the emergency shelter system.

At the height of the program last year, there were more than 120 active hotel shelters in the state.

The Healey Administration said two months ago that there had been a decline in the hotel shelter caseload, after they'd spent hundreds of millions of dollars on the program over the last three years to assist families.

367,136,"Rajya Sabha erupts over denied debate requests, adjourned briefly amid uproar",https://munsifdaily.com/rajya-sabha-erupts-over-denied-debate-requests/,01/08/2025 07:13,munsifdaily,GB,migrant,"New Delhi: The Rajya Sabha witnessed a stormy start to its Friday proceedings, with the House adjourned till noon following a heated standoff between the Chair and Opposition members.

Deputy Chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh announced that 30 notices had been received under Rule 267, seeking suspension of business to discuss matters of urgent public importance. However, he ruled that none of the submissions conformed to the procedural requirements and therefore could not be admitted.

This triggered immediate uproar from the Opposition benches, who accused the Chair of stifling debate on critical national issues.

Among the concerns raised were demands for a discussion on the Special Investigation Report in Bihar, voiced by a wide coalition of members, including Md Nadimul Haque (Trinamool Congress), Manoj Kumar Jha (RJD), Tiruchi Siva (DMK MP), Ranjeet Ranjan (Congress), Neeraj Dangi (Congress), Rajani Ashokrao Patil (Congress), and others.

Simultaneously, Opposition members from Odisha flagged the alarming rise in crimes against women and children, while representatives from West Bengal raised the issue of discrimination against Bengali migrant workers in other states.

Jebi Mather (Congress) and CPI(MP)’s A.A. Rahim’s notice was for a debate on the arrest of two nuns in Durg, Chhattisgarh, while Sanjay Singh (AAP) and Ramjilal Suman (SP) pressed for a discussion on the economic fallout of tariffs and penalties imposed by former US President Donald Trump on Indian exports. CPI(M)’s V. Sivadasan demanded a discussion on the crisis of mass layoffs in the Indian IT sector.

Despite repeated appeals, including a pointed intervention by Manoj Kumar Jha, the Deputy Chairman stood firm, stating that the matter concerning the SIR was sub-judice and under the jurisdiction of the Election Commission of India, a constitutional authority.

He reiterated that the House’s rules were clear and that Zero Hour and Question Hour could not be converted into a platform for suspended business.

This assertion only intensified the protests, with members continuing to shout slogans — “Vote chori band karo” and “Kesaria pe halla bol” — which echoed through the chamber, as members accused the Chair of denying them the right to raise grievances and issues of national importance.

Ashok Kumar Mittal of the Aam Aadmi Party rose to read out his notice for Zero Hour, but it could not be heard due to the pandemonium. The Speaker tried to pacify the Opposition members by saying, “Pura desh dekh raha hai… aap jan samasya nahi uthane de rahe hain, aap rules follow nahi karna chahte (you are not allowing fellow members to raise public issues as you do not want to follow rules).”

As the din rendered proceedings inaudible, the House was forced to adjourn.

Earlier in the day, several ministers tabled official papers and reports. Ministers Jitendra Prasad, Ram Nath Thakur, Dr. L. Murugan, Kamlesh Paswan, Navneet Singh, Bhupathi Raju Srinivas Sharma, and Pabitra Margherita presented updates on rural development and railways, including the second and sixth reports on rural development and the third report of the Standing Committee on Railways from the 18th Lok Sabha.

A statement was also made regarding government business for the upcoming week.

The legislative agenda outlined by the government included proposals for extending Presidential Rule for another six months, along with a series of Bills such as the Carriage of Goods by Sea Bill, the Coastal Shipping Bill 2025, the Merchant Shipping Bill, and the Indian Sports Bill.

Other items included the National Sports Bill, the National Anti-Doping Amendment Bill 2025, the Manipur Goods and Services Tax Bill, and the Appropriation Bill for Manipur for the financial year 2025–26.

A Bill proposing the readjustment of Scheduled Tribe representation in Goa was also to be introduced in next week’s business.

As the House prepared to reconvene post-noon, the mood remained tense. With the Opposition determined to press its case and the Chair holding firm on procedural grounds, the day’s proceedings appeared poised for further deadlock.",NewsData.io,,,not found,,,,"munsifdaily, The Munsif Daily",not found,https://ground.news/interest/the-munsif-daily_381de1,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,munsifdaily.com,,munsifdaily,224,UK,,,,

""These households are not illegal immigrants, asylum seekers or refugees""

A council has spoken out to dispel rumours about the residents of a hotel near Cardiff Airport. The Vale of Glamorgan Council said there has been ""misinformation and speculation"" about residents staying temporarily at the Holiday Inn Express in Rhoose.

The hotel has been selected by the Ministry of Defence (MOD) for use as temporary accommodation for entitled persons (EPs) from Afghanistan on a short-term basis, the Vale of Glamorgan Council has said in a statement. It said that it is a UK Government scheme, led by the MOD.

The hotel has already been used previously to home families in desperate situations.

Conservative regional Senedd member for South Wales Central, Andrew RT Davies, has questioned the appropriateness of a site with limited access to facilities and services.

A statement from the council read: ""The MOD is the most appropriate organisation to provide details about the arrangement.

""However, as there has been speculation and misinformation about the project on social media and within the local community, the council feels it is important that residents are given the facts.

""As EPs, this group have the right to live in the UK following their efforts supporting the British military in Afghanistan.

""These households are not illegal immigrants, asylum seekers or refugees.

""The UK Government has granted them indefinite leave to remain in this country, which is now regarded as their home.

""The first of two intakes, which is expected shortly, will consist of 19 families with children, three couples and a single person.

This temporary arrangement, lasting up to nine months, is in place while they are helped to find more permanent accommodation across the UK.""

Leader of the Vale of Glamorgan Council, councillor Lis Burnett, said: “This location has been selected by the MOD as part of an operation to help a distinct group of people who have fled Afghanistan after working in partnership with UK Forces in that country.

“They have every right to live in this country following the commitment and loyalty they have shown and, in a large number of cases, the sacrifices they have made.

“This is not a council initiative, but one organised and operated by the MOD, which we are supporting.

""As with previous schemes, funding has been provided by the UK Government.

“The communities of the Vale have a long history of helping those in need and values relating to tolerance, acceptance, understanding and inclusivity are a central feature of this council’s ongoing ethos and approach.

“Naturally, we also care deeply about our existing residents and feel you should be informed about what’s happening in your locality.

“Over recent weeks, council teams have been working with colleagues from the MOD, Welsh Government and other agencies to prepare for arrivals.

“Initial conversations have taken place with local schools to assess existing capacity and the possibility of placing children, but no final decisions can be made until the EPs arrive and the age of the children is known.

‌



""As is common when dealing with sensitive issues like this, these discussions have needed to be kept confidential.

“The UK Government will provide funding to support education and increase the capacity of health services such as doctor’s surgeries.

“We have a shining example of how successful a temporary placement of EPs can be in nearby St Athan, where the local community embraced arrivals from Afghanistan staying on the army base there.

‌



“Those individuals were invited to join local sports clubs, while residents worked together to collect items they may need to be more comfortable. I’m confident the people of Rhoose, Barry and the wider Vale of Glamorgan area will be equally welcoming.

“Many of these people will have suffered great trauma, given up everything and left their homes to move to a new country.

""It is highly likely they will feel vulnerable and scared as they start a completely new life.

‌



“The Vale will be these families’ first home in the UK – it is up to us to help them acclimatise and adjust to life here. As a community, I’m sure we will offer them the empathy and dignity they deserve.

“I’m proud of our previous achievements. People in the Vale have a consistent track record of greeting new arrivals with warmth, hospitality and compassion. That is what we do because that is the kind of place we all want to live in.”

The council says it is in regular contact with the MOD and other partners and ""will provide further updates on this matter as the situation develops"".

The event, sanctioned by FIFA, seeks to establish a 23-player women's squad for upcoming friendly internationals.

Many players from Afghanistan's women's national team sought refuge after the Taliban took control in 2021, banning women's sports across the nation. Efforts to bring these women back into the international fold have gained momentum, with FIFA approving the creation of a special Afghan women's refugee team.

Under the guidance of former Scotland international Pauline Hamill, this initiative extends beyond merely assembling a team, offering players opportunities for professional growth, equipment access, and mentorship. FIFA President Gianni Infantino highlighted the project's significance, emphasizing plans to expand it globally, supporting women athletes everywhere.

380,231,Rapists among those jailed at Teesside Crown Court in July,https://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/25355033.rapists-among-jailed-teesside-crown-court-july/,01/08/2025 07:00,thenorthernecho,,asylum,"We take a look at some of the most serious offenders to be sentenced through July, including a cruel fraudster at Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court.

Hotel rapist

A rapist who refused to listen when a woman repeatedly asked him to stop has been locked up.

Thomas English was having consensual sex with the woman, but when he failed to stop despite her repeated requests, she was forced to push him off her.

Teesside Crown Court heard how the 24-year-old had picked the woman up from the Leeds area before bringing her to Darlington for a night out.

Rebecca Brown, prosecuting, said the pair were staying at the Premier Inn at Morton Park in January 2022 when the rape happened after meeting online and becoming friends.

She said the complainant engaged in consensual sex in the hotel room with the defendant, but asked him to stop as she was getting sore.

In a victim impact statement, the woman blasted her rapist for waiting until the last minute to admit what he had done to her.

She said: “Thomas, why take it right to the end? Did you think that I would give up? If you really knew me, you would know that I am a strong woman who stands up for what is right.""

English, of Bushel Hill Drive, Mowden, Darlington, pleaded guilty to rape after the jury was sworn in at the beginning of his trial.

David Ward, mitigating, said his client had expressed his shame and remorse in his pre-sentence report.

Judge Stephen Ashurst told the defendant it was a shame he didn’t plead guilty at an earlier stage when he had already made admissions to the victim in messages.

Sentencing English to three years in prison for raping the woman, he said: “She told you that she wanted you to stop, ultimately, you said you carried on for no more than 30 seconds, that it was a 30-second mistake.

“Your victim begs to differ; she maintains that she asked you not once but four times to stop.”

Manipulative rapist

A rapist who targeted a vulnerable woman to satisfy his sexual needs has been jailed for the brutal attack.

Hamed Kianipanah repeatedly told his victim that the sex attack was consensual throughout the ordeal in 2022.

The 34-year-old was described as manipulative and a domestic abuser after he was found guilty following a trial at Teesside Crown Court.

Dr Christopher Wood, prosecuting, said the rape had a devastating impact on the victim, who suffered from a number of medical conditions.

The court heard how Kianipanah had befriended his victim while he was living in the Stockton area, while his asylum application was being processed.

Dr Wood said the defendant turned to the internet to find sexual partners while he was living apart from his wife.

He said the couple entered a consensual relationship before the defendant forced himself on the woman just before they were due to head out to a party after she handed over a large sum of money to him.

Kianipanah, of Brook Road, Brent, London, was found guilty of a single count of rape following a trial.

Robert Mochrie, mitigating, said his client was of previous good character before his conviction and continues to deny the offence.

Judge Jonathan Carrol passed a 12-year extended sentence, meaning Kianipanah will serve nine years in custody followed by three additional years on licence.

Kianipanah was also ordered to sign the sex offenders’ register for life as a result of his conviction.

Balaclava-clad burglar

A burglar who ram-raided a shop before taking police on a high-speed chase was arrested after he crashed his van into a lamppost.

Daniel Pears used the Transit flatbed van to smash his way into the Co-op in Easingwold before stealing more than £900 from the tills and grabbing a bottle of booze.

The 37-year-old driving the distinctive van, with a refrigerator strapped to the back, in the area before attempting to pull him over as he raced around North Yorkshire.

Teesside Crown Court heard how Pears sped off swerving in and out of traffic on the A19 while at points driving in the wrong direction towards oncoming traffic.

Caroline McGurk, prosecuting, said CCTV captured Pears entering the shop via the damaged security shutter wearing high-vis trousers, a fleece and a balaclava.

“He left the store with the money and a bottle of spirit before driving away,” she said.

Pears, of Bishopton Lane, Middlesbrough, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and burglary following his arrest in the early hours of April 5 this year.

He also pleaded guilty to two breaches of a community order imposed for previous offences including assaulting a police officer.

Lee Goodchild, mitigating, said his client had been struggling with drink and drug problems at the time of the offence.

Recorder Aisha Wadoodi sentence Pears to a total of 18 months for all offences and banned him from driving for 21 months after admitting he stole the cash and bottle of vodka.

She said: “This was an appalling piece of driving and it is right to say that you were subject to three community orders at the time, so you were being provided with help in relation to staying out of trouble.""

Cruel fraudster

A fraudster who betrayed the trust of an elderly couple who treated her like one of their own children has walked free from court.

Nikki Alderson stole £3,900 from the New Brancepeth couple after she was given access to their bank account to help them with essentials as their health failed.

The 43-year-old withdrew the cash on a number of occasions over several months before her breach of trust was discovered, Newton Aycliffe Magistrates' Court heard on Thursday (July 10).

Heather Blair, prosecuting, said the husband had passed away since the theft and his wife was now living in a care home after being diagnosed with dementia.

The court heard how Alderson had paid back £780 to the family but there was still £3,900 outstanding after the couple's bank account was checked.

The elderly man, who has since passed away, said in his victim impact statement that Alderson’s theft had left his family devastated.

Alderson, of Briar Close in Fencehouses, Houghton-le-Spring, pleaded guilty to theft and fraud by false representation between September 2023 and March 2024.

Adam Scott, mitigating, urged the magistrates to follow the recommendations in his client’s pre-sentence report.

John Hames, the chairman of the bench, said: “These matters have passed the custodial threshold, it is a clear breach of trust of vulnerable victims.

“It was committed over a period of time and the money has never been recovered.""

Alderson was sentenced to eight months in prison suspended for 12 months.

She was also ordered to attend 15 rehabilitation activity requirement days and repay the £3,900 to the family.",NewsData.io,,,not found,,,,"thenorthernecho, The Northern Echo, thenorthernecho.co.uk  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-northern-echo-bias/,https://ground.news/interest/the-northern-echo,not found,LEAST BIASED,HIGH,United Kingdom,,Newspaper,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,High,Center,Center,Unknown,Unknown,Center,thenorthernecho.co.uk,,thenorthernecho,79,United Kingdom,,,,

The list is part of an effort by the right-wing government in Rome to speed up the vetting of asylum requests and to allow fewer people to enter Italy.

The Italian government aims to bring migrants hailing from countries designated as safe and intercepted in the Mediterranean Sea to a reception centre in Albania where their asylum requests are examined under an accelerated procedure.

Two Bangladeshi nationals challenged the rejection of their requests for international protection based on the assumption that Bangladesh is a safe country as per the list.

The Italian court dealing with the matter called on the European Court of Justice to clarify if the Italian government was allowed to compile the list of safe countries under EU law, if Rome has to unveil its sources for declaring a country as safe and what criteria have to be respected.

With right-wing positions gaining popularity across the 27-member bloc, many EU countries are adapting a tougher stance on migration.

Furious locals descended onto the Stanwell Hotel in Spelthorne, Surrey after the Home Office recently confirmed that it was changing from a mixed accommodation building to one housing just male migrants.

Dozens of protestors carried signs reading “just say no” and were heard chanting ""protect our kids"", as police monitored the demonstration.

It came after another protest took place outside The Bell Hotel in Epping, Essex amid calls by the local council and MP for its closure after an Ethiopian resident was charged with sexual assault, harassment and inciting a girl to engage in sexual activity.

Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 41, who arrived in Britain via small boat on June 29, denies any wrongdoing and remains in custody.

On Thursday, officers from Essex Police facilitated a march at The Bell Hotel towards the village’s High Street, by the same group, and no arrests were made.

In a letter sent to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, Spelthorne Borough Council leader Joanne Sexton raised concerns regarding changes to the Stanwell Hotel.

Ms Sexton added that the families already placed at the hotel had been ""integrating well and building community ties"".

However, Ms Sexton warned that ""this abrupt change risks undermining all that”, adding that she is ""alarmed about the potential consequences of the proposed changes and the impact they will have"".

The DAFT visa program provides a pathway for these individuals to start anew by fostering small business initiatives, thereby offering an escape from policy-induced perils.

Under Trump's administration, several policies have hindered rights for LGBTQ+ communities, leading individuals like Alex and Lucy, a trans couple, to Amsterdam, where they can openly experience the freedom to live as they are. Though official data is scarce, the increase in DAFT visa applications highlights an uptick in migration among this group.

Despite the ease offered by the DAFT visa, the process of relocating is not within everyone's reach, raising concerns among activists advocating for broader asylum options. The Dutch government faces calls to reevaluate the U.S. status as a safe haven for queer asylum seekers —a complex political maneuver— as the U.S. witnesses a rollback of vital LGBTQ+ rights.

Sailing through Sydney Harbour and out into the Pacific Ocean at this time of year, one might well catch a glimpse of a gentle giant or two making their passage up the east coast of Australia. Each year, an estimated 40,000 or more humpback whales make the long journey up from their feeding grounds near the Antarctic landmass to the warmer waters of Queensland to breed and calve. It is one of nature’s great journeys and, supposedly, quite the sight – though a few whale watchers this week have been left disappointed with the massive mammals keeping their heads under water and out of the gathering storms that have battered the Sydney shores.

This weekend, another great mass migration will come to an end. It is tough to place an exact figure on the volume of the sea of red that has again filled the city streets, given the existing British and Irish influence in Sydney, but the travelling fans have come in the hope of history and an expectation that their side will finish the Test series in the right way. More than two months after they first came together at a hotel in Richmond, it is certain that when the British and Irish Lions finally disassemble on Sunday, they will do so with a series won – but the goal for this team, set out by Andy Farrell in those embryonic days, has always been 3-0.

“I never think you should shy away from shooting for the stars because you might end up on the moon,” head coach Farrell explained with his squad having made no secret of their ambition. “That’s pretty good as well.

“That’s the quality that we’re chasing. I don’t think you should shy away from challenging each other, and if you don’t get there, then hopefully it’s somewhere near.

“It sets the mentality in my mind of what delivering means, and you’ve always got a level to aim at.”

A defeat to Argentina in Dublin is something of a bugbear given it takes emulating the “Invincibles” of 1974 off the table, but there are plenty of historians within and beyond the squad cooing eagerly over the prospect of a whitewash. Even Willie John McBride’s glorious vintage did not manage that, a draw in the fourth match of that South Africa series taking a slight shine off a trip upon which the Lions won every other game.

Indeed, one must delve deeper into the annals to retrieve the last clean sweep. The 1927 adventure in Argentina is a relic of a bygone age – it was the first time the side yet to be known as the Pumas sported the now-familiar blue and white hoops, while visiting captain David MacMyn wrote in his travel diary of practising daily on the long sea voyage down to South America.

“We were all imbued with the desire to play as it should be played, and there was no laziness in our preparation on board the ship,” MacMyn wrote. “We train hard. Every morning we had practice of scrum, backs, physical training of all kinds and swimming before lunch. At night we had many conversations in front of the blackboard and we made all kinds of plans. And so, the hard training and the free exchange of ideas stimulated us for the exhausting days that we had ahead.”

Perhaps the Scottish forward and Farrell would have found themselves kindred spirits. There is much in MacMyn’s diary that would chime with the words and deeds of the Lions head coach on this trip, from a balance of fun and fierce work ethic to a wish to play the game in the right way. On Thursday, Farrell spoke with pride of not just the results his team have achieved but the ambitious manner in which they have achieved them; it hasn’t always clicked on this tour, yet you could never accuse the tourists of playing with too cautious a streak.

The theme of this week has been “one last push”, with Farrell strapping up weary and wounded warriors to go again in a familiar-looking team. The presence of two covering replacements for the back row, plus the versatile Ollie Chessum, is in part a nod to the heavy workloads shouldered by Tadhg Beirne, Tom Curry and Jack Conan, three of the Lions’ best in the Tests.

Much has been made of the unique challenge Farrell faces in getting his side up for this game with the series won – a task Ian McGeechan did not succeed in on the 1997 tour – but this has equally been a tricky week for his counterpart Joe Schmidt. The Australia head coach has run the full gamut of emotions in a search for the whys and wherefores of defeat snatched from the jaws of victory in Melbourne, from deep introspection to (perhaps understandable) frustration and fury at the bounces of the ball and 50/50 decisions that did not fall the Wallabies’ way.

“It was an incredibly deflated group,” Schmidt muttered morosely. “Tuesday was tough, actually, to get them up off the canvas, and on Thursday there was a little bit of an upswing, and we’ve just got to keep that momentum. Hopefully they can be sharp and then springboard their way into the Test match.”

open image in gallery The Wallabies will feel they let a golden opportunity slip in Melbourne ( Getty )

The veteran coach found himself forced to defend the selection of Nic White, who will start at scrum-half in his final international appearance, dismissing accusations that it was a selection made for anything other than rugby reasons. “I’m not a sentimentalist,” Schmidt stressed. “It’s a Test match and you pick people who are capable of playing that Test match, and we believe that Nic is.” The experienced nine’s kicking game in anticipated squalls will be handy, while his competitive spirit is undoubted and perhaps necessary in lifting the Australia squad.

It is about this time on any tour when one begins to ponder the nebulous concept of legacies, a look to the future and past simultaneously, to imagine how this series and these sides will come to be remembered in time. The MCG humdinger, a sporting spectacle to rival any, has ensured that even a damp squib in the final Test will not necessarily leave this affair lagging far behind recent tours. The Wallabies, too, proved a few people wrong; let us hope this can be a step in the right direction towards a genuine title tilt at a home World Cup in 2027. Another strong showing would see the belief from the Australian public grow.

But for these Lions, who have talked of wanting to be remembered as one of the best in history? A 2-1 win over a middling opponent would not probably do that, but a whitewash achieved in some style would greatly enhance their reputation. Like most sides in this modern age, plenty has been sacrificed on the altar of high performance during this tour; now is the time to provide a lasting memory of a truly great British and Irish Lions team.",NewsData.io,-6.88,,https://adfontesmedia.com/independent-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,38.49,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/,https://ground.news/interest/the-independent,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/independent-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,,,-2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,independent.co.uk,,independentuk,56,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Independent,

418,41,SME housebuilders are key to growth – and the Conservative revival,https://www.cityam.com/sme-housebuilders-are-key-to-growth-and-the-conservative-revival/,01/08/2025 04:58,cityam,,mass migration,"SME housebuilders are key to growth – and the Conservative revival

The number of build to rent completions has increased by almost 16 per cent in the past year

Housing was a major cause of the Conservative collapse – particularly with young people. If we want to build the right houses in the right places, SMEs are the answer, says Jack Rankin

Like the Chancellor, I’m no economist. She might have a degree in PPE, but you don’t need that to work out that for years demand for housing has been too high and supply too low. Now those in think-tank land have confirmed it: mass migration has pushed up rents £132 per month in England and we’re some 6.5 million homes short of where we need to be.

People will write PhDs in the future about my party’s collapse at last year’s general election, but for those under 50, housing – or rather the lack of it – was a massive factor. It’s no surprise then that in last year’s election my party polled terribly with anyone under 50. I said at the time that it felt like every young-ish Conservative voter had been at my wedding. I’m glad to have been proven wrong on this: if anything, this has given new purpose to young professional groups like NextGen Tories, Conservative YIMBY or Looking for Growth who are using social media to be the voice of a new generation. Make it easier for young people to own a stake in society and you might just win over a new set of Conservative voters. After all, why be a capitalist if you don’t believe that by your industry and hard work, you could own capital? There can be a tendency in my party to dismiss Gail’s-loving young professionals as a Lib Dem problem, but young people want the same things every generation wants: a strong pound in their pocket, the chance to raise a family and a place to call their own.

Urban sprawl

But this doesn’t have to mean urban sprawl with developers dragging and dropping indentikit homes on the countryside. We are all familiar with the usual objections to pretty much every large-scale development – I’ve raised some of them myself – and these aren’t going away any time soon, despite Labour’s attempts to steamroller local voices in their Planning and Infrastructure Bill. Clearly, squaring that circle isn’t simple, but part of the solution may well lie with SME housebuilders.

When we were building enough homes it was SMEs who accounted for the majority of completions, creating competition in the market both on price and quality. Smaller developers tend to have a much deeper understanding of place – where to build, local styles and materials and how best to work with, rather than against, the glorious English countryside. SMEs will have a bigger stake in the future of these communities – it follows that this kind of development will be easier to sell to local people. Not to mention that without the financial reserves of big developers, SMEs have more incentive to build out quickly.

We also need to stop pretending that London and our other major cities can’t be built up anymore. We’ve seen record low housebuilding in our capital under Labour even though many parts of London are less dense than, Barcelona, or even Leeds: it’s half the density of Paris! As Kemi Badenoch says, young people are paying the price. It’s killing aspiration: you might turn down that great job offer in the city if the pay rise is outweighed by increased rent. We have vast brownfield sites, redundant retail zones, and absurdly low-rise areas just minutes from major stations – there are even prisons in zone 2! If we allowed more upward development, particularly around transport hubs, we could meet housing demand without laying a finger on the green belt.

We have vast brownfield sites, redundant retail zones, and absurdly low-rise areas just minutes from major London stations – there are even prisons in zone 2!

This is where SMEs come in: repurposing a vacant shop in a city centre or building upwards through permitted development rights isn’t worth a bigger developer’s time when they are sitting on masses of green belt; SME housebuilders have a competitive advantage and yet the planning system often seems to work against them. The recent report published by the SME housebuilders APPG reflects this with an overwhelming 96 per cent of SME housebuilders surveyed running into major planning barriers even when sites are available.

Labour have made some positive noises, such as easier access to finance, that have been welcomed by the industry, but there are claims that half of the remaining 2,500 SME housebuilders may well go bust by the next election. This would just be the latest in a series of blows to their ‘1.5 million’ target. Meanwhile, landlords are selling up ahead of the implementation of the Renters Rights Bill and we know by now that Labour aren’t serious about tackling migration, or anything else really. We know the Prime Minister doesn’t get it- according to him there is plenty of housing for asylum seekers.

Politicians need to stop talking about ‘the right homes in the right places’ without a roadmap for how to achieve this. SME housebuilders that can listen to local needs and take on challenging brownfield sites may well hold the answer, and we need policy that reflects this.

Aug. 1 (UPI) -- A federal judge has ruled to postpone the Trump administration's termination of deportation protections for tens of thousands of migrants from Honduras, Nepal and Nicaragua amid litigation.

Judge Trina Thompson of the U.S. District Court in Northern California issued her strongly worded order Thursday, delaying the termination of Temporary Protected Status until at least Nov. 18, when a hearing is scheduled to hear the merits of the case.

The ruling is a win for immigration advocates, who have been fighting Trump's crackdown on immigration and policies seeking to mass-deport migrants in the country.

""The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty and the American dream. That is all plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names and purify their blood. The court disagrees,"" Thompson said in her decision.

TPS was established by Congress in 1990 to shield migrants in the United States from being deported to their home countries experiencing problems, such as war, conflict or famine, where they would be put into harm's way.

Honduras and Nicaragua were both granted TPS designation in January 1999, following the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch a year prior, with Nepal receiving the designation in 2015.

Some 60,000 people from the three countries are currently protected from being deported to their native nations because of TPS, many of whom have been in the United States for decades.

Trump has attempted to dismantle TPS. In early June, he announced it was ending such protections for those from Nepal, followed by doing the same for those from Honduras and Nicaragua. The designations were to be terminated within 60 days -- Aug. 5 for Nepal and Sept. 8 for Honduras and Nicaragua.

The Trump administration cited that conditions in each of the three countries no longer warranted TPS designation.

The move was met with litigation filed by the National TPS Alliance on July 7, arguing the terminations violated the Administrative Procedure Act by failing to follow the necessary review process rules while stating racial animus was the actual motive behind ending the deportation protections.

The next day, National TPS Alliance filed for postponement of the terminations.

""Today's court decision is a powerful affirmation of our humanity and our right to live without fear,"" Sandhya Lama, a TPS holder from Nepal and plaintiff in the case, said in a statement. ""As a TPS holder and mother, this victory means safety, hope and the chance to keep building our lives here.""

In her decision, Thompson, a President Joe Biden appointee, cited comments from Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem about TPS and immigrants as proof of racial animus behind the terminations.

She said Noem had intended to end TPS without first reviewing any country condition reports and that she had expressed bias against the program.

""These statements reflect the secretary's animus against immigrants and the TPS program even though individuals with TPS hold lawful status -- a protected status that we expressly conferred by Congress with the purpose of providing humanitarian relief,"" Thompson said, adding that TPS holders have contributed billion to the economy by legally working, paying taxes and contributing to Medicare.

""By stereotyping the TPS program and immigrants as invaders that are criminal, and by highlighting the need for migration management, Secretary Noem's statements perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.""

Thompson also mentioned comments from Trump and other White House officials about migrants that show racial animus.

The agency said its Fugitive Search Unit (FSU) caught Ham Seong Hwan, 38, and Kim Jongbaek, 21, over fraud operations in a house inside the freeport.

Two other South Koreans, identified as Kim Taekyeong, 37, and Park Jinhyung, 36, were also arrested after being caught working in the said scheme which allegedly lures travelers through various platforms such as fake hotel websites with low rates, flights, and tour offers.

The FSU also arrested on the same day another South Korean identified as Park Youngjun, 43 along Jose Abad Santos Avenue inside Clark Freeport.

The suspect was tagged as an undesirable alien after an Interpol red notice was issued against him.

A warrant of arrest was issued against the foreigner by the Seongnam branch of Suwon District Court for fraud in violation of South Korean laws.

He allegedly created fraudulent accounts and subscription notifications on a major South Korean live-streaming platform, illegally earning 4.6 million Won or more than P190,000.

The operations were conducted in coordination with Korean authorities, the Philippine Air Force in Northern Luzon, and Clark Development Corporation.

""If the US continues its foreign policy, anti-migrant rhetoric, it's going to put founders off and operators off,"" said Husayn Kassai, a founder of the London AI Hub and the chief executive of Quench AI.

""Already you have some students that were considering moving to the US [now] considering the UK, and you have tech founders and operators, which are just as important, again increasingly considering the UK relative to the US,"" he said to Sky News during London Tech Week.

His comments come amid a US political landscape in which immigrant communities across America have been surprised at the speed and ferocity with which new policies, including crackdowns and deportations, have been enacted in Mr Trump's first 100 days in office.

In the last few days, some in California - the home of tech hotspot the San Francisco Bay area - have been taking direct action in protest at the Trump administration's actions.

After selling his previous company Onfido for a record amount last year, Mr Kassai decided to found his new start-up in the UK because of its talent pool.

""In the US, there's talk of there being more talent, more AI talent in particular. That's changing because of some of the US politics.

""[Also,] in places like San Francisco, there may be more AI talent but it's not accessible to early-stage startups,"" he added, saying that's because huge companies like Meta and Google are able to offer such high salaries.

Talent is often the deciding factor in where companies move their operations, according to one expert whose job it is to persuade them to come to the UK.

Laura Citron, chief executive of London and Partners, said she often talks to international founders thinking about where to expand globally.

""Making sure that businesses feel [...] it will be easy for them to bring international talent into the market, that will always be the most important factor.""

""Particularly at the moment, with what's happening geopolitically, that fundamental strength of London in openness and being inclusive and welcoming has suddenly really shot up in people's importance,"" she said.

The UK is the third-largest AI market in the world, according to the government, only beaten by the US and China.

Yesterday, Jensen Huang, chief executive of NVIDIA predicted that within ten years, ""every industry in the UK will be a tech industry"".

The government seems to be banking on that, with investments being announced like yesterday's unveiling of a £187m AI training plan for school students and schemes to encourage infrastructure like data centres to be built around the UK.

In January, the government claimed that, if AI is ""fully embraced"", it could bring £47bn to the economy every year.

But although President Trump's changes to US immigration policy may push more tech workers to the UK, the US still has its draw - and cash.

From 5 July 2024 - the day after Labour won the election - to 31 May 2025, 6,410 people have been arrested on suspicion of working illegally, according to Home Office figures.

This is a rise of 51% on the previous year when the Conservatives were in government, the department says.

As part of Labour's Plan for Change, enforcement officials have made 9,000 visits to restaurants, nail bars, and construction sites, among other premises, to root out those suspected of working without a visa - a 48% increase in activity during the previous year.

Video footage shows the moment 36 people were arrested at a construction site in Belfast's Titanic Quarter where enforcement officials uncovered people breaching their visa conditions and working in the UK having entered the country illegally.

People traffickers often trick migrants into deadly small boat crossings by promising they will be able to find work in the UK, when in reality, those arrive safely are instead forced into squalid conditions, for no or little money.

Employers are supposed to carry out right-to-work checks on all new employees who come from abroad - with those who fail to do so facing £60,000 fines per worker, director disqualifications, and prison sentences of up to five years.

30,000 returned to home countries

Alongside the arrests, since Labour came to power, almost 30,000 people who had no right to be in the UK have been returned to their home countries, according to Home Office data.

The government says it is also introducing tougher laws, extending right-to-work checks, and targeting particular sectors known to be linked to illegal workers.

Dame Angela Eagle, minister for border security and asylum, said: ""For too long, employers have been able to take on and exploit migrants, with people allowed to arrive and work here illegally.

""This will no longer be tolerated on our watch. That's why we are ramping up our enforcement activity and introducing tougher laws to finally get a grip of our immigration and asylum system.""

Eddy Montgomery, director of enforcement, compliance and crime for immigration enforcement, added: ""Our work to tackle illegal working is vital in not only bringing the guilty to account, but also in protecting vulnerable people from exploitation.

The older teen is reportedly in Brazil with family. Sisters Nayara Ferreira De Moura and Karoline Ferreira De Moura of Worcester. National Center for Missing & Exploited Children

Two teenaged children of a Worcester mother detained by federal immigration officials earlier this year have been reported missing, with one traveling back to Brazil according to a national organization and media reports.

Rosane Ferreira De Oliveira, of Brazil, is in federal custody after being detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents on Eureka Street in Worcester in May. She was reportedly lured outside her home by agents who used her grandchild as “bait” before neighbors surrounded ICE agents.

Two of her daughters were present at her arrest, including an adult daughter and 17-year-old Nayara Ferreira De Moura, who was reported missing by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Her 13-year-old sister Karoline Ferreira De Moura was also reported missing by the same organization.

Worcester police confirmed “there are two sisters missing out of Worcester.” A 17-year-old left custody of the Department of Children and Families in late May, and a 13-year-old left custody of DCF on July 20, a spokesperson said. The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children reported that Karoline was last seen July 20 as well.

DCF did not return a request for comment Thursday night.

Lawyer Andrew Lattrulo told MassLive that Nayara is with an older sister in Brazil, but Karoline is still missing.

Charges dropped against mother, teen daughter

Nayara appears to be the same teen girl who was arrested by Worcester police during her mother’s arrest. Officials requested charges be dropped against the teen “given the totality of the circumstances” after the department released body camera footage of the incident.

A local assault and battery with a dangerous weapon charge against Ferreira De Oliveira that was previously cited by ICE was also dropped. She was accused of hitting one of her daughters with a phone charger cable, according to court records. A prosecutor wrote that “the complaining witness in this case does not wish to proceed.”

Before the case was dropped, the woman’s defense attorneys filed a motion to amend the bail conditions asking to be able to be near Nayara, who is the complaining witness. The judge allowed the motion.

“Ferreira de Oliveira is the only parent available to Nayara,” her lawyer Sarah Amorin wrote. “There are many legitimate needs for a custodial parent and 17 year old to have contact with each other, including medical.”

Amorin declined to comment on the missing daughters.

Chaotic ICE arrest in May involved local politician

Worcester neighbors including City Councilor Etel Haxhiaj flocked to the scene of Ferreira de Oliveira’s arrest in May, with people reportedly forming a “human ring” around the mother and children. The daughters tried to stand in front of the ICE vehicle holding their mother to stop the agents from leaving, according to body camera footage.

After her arrest, an ICE spokesperson said Ferreira de Oliveira was a “violent criminal illegal alien” and cited the now-dropped charges in Worcester District Court.

In addition to the teen daughter, another Worcester resident was also arrested, but the most serious charge against them was dropped last week.

Haxhiaj is charged with assault weeks after the confrontation. She pleaded not guilty with a misdemeanor charge of assault and battery on a police officer and interfering with a police officer.The arrests prompted thousands to gather during multiple demonstrations across the city, and dozens of Worcester residents attended a meeting criticizing city council and police.

432,204,Rival anti-migrant and anti-racism protests face off outside a hotel housing migrants in London,https://apnews.com/article/britain-migration-protests-asylum-hotels-2271d550f5a3c14e0821f0eb67fbd861,2025-08-02T18:23:59Z,The Associated Press,US,migrant,"LONDON (AP) — Anti-immigrant and anti-racism demonstrators faced off in London on Saturday in the latest in a series of protests outside hotels housing asylum-seekers.

Several hundred protesters waving Union Jacks gathered outside the Thistle City Barbican Hotel in central London, calling for it to be closed as housing for migrants. Chants including “Scum” and “Britain is full” were directed at the hotel.

Police separated the demonstrators from a larger group of counter-protesters chanting “refugees are welcome here,” as people inside the hotel watched from windows.

Protests against migrants have taken place in recent weeks in Epping, a town on the outskirts of London where an asylum-seeker was accused of sexual assault, and in a smattering of other towns in England.

Protesters say they are concerned about the safety risk posed by the migrants, many of them young men who have recently arrived in Britain in dinghies across the English Channel.

The demonstrations have drawn local people, but have also been attended, and in some cases organized, by far-right groups.

The protests come a year after several days of anti-immigrant rioting across England and Northern Ireland. Crowds in more than two dozen towns attacked hotels housing migrants, as well as mosques, police stations and a library. Some rioters targeted non-white people and threw bricks and fireworks at police.

The summer 2024 violence was sparked when three girls were stabbed to death at a summer dance class in the town of Southport, and online misinformation identified the attacker as a recently arrived migrant. In fact, killer Axel Rudakubana was a British-born 17-year-old.

Experts and community groups warn that the mix of anger, fear, misinformation and political agitating that fueled that violence could erupt again, though protests this summer have been small and largely peaceful.",GNews,-2.46,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.81,"the associated press, Associated Press, AP, apnews.com, ap, ap news, associated press",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press-apnews/,https://ground.news/interest/ap,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/associated-press-media-bias,,,,,,,,Left,Cooperatively owned,1846,-3.02,,,Unknown,Unknown,Left,Left,Left,apnews.com,,the associated press,32,USA,,,,

The plan left lawmakers and advocates demanding more transparency.

Redacted pages on Alligator Alcatraz hurricane plan leave key questions unanswered

The draft, titled ""South Florida Detention Facility Continuity of Operations Plan,"" was issued by the Florida Division of Emergency Management (FDEM).

It outlines broad hurricane evacuation protocols, including transportation, staffing and relocation procedures for detainees. However, large portions of the document — sometimes entire pages — have been blacked out, including the list of five alternate facilities that could be used during an evacuation.

On page 4, the plan reads: ""The geography [of] this location, while ideal for integrated detention operations in support of the DHS–ICE initiatives, is vulnerable to tropical weather.""

It continues: ""All vendors have developed individual continuity planning procedures to include the level of staffing necessary to support the STDF concurrently with evacuation and relocation of detainees to alternate facilities…""

Who those vendors are and what the procedures entail remains unclear.

DeSantis administration defends facility's storm readiness

Gov. Ron DeSantis and state officials addressed the facility's storm readiness at a press conference held at Alligator Alcatraz last week.

FDEM Executive Director Kevin Guthrie said that the facility could withstand winds up to a Category 2 hurricane.

""I may have visited some facilities in the state of Florida. Why? Because this facility, as I've said before, can withstand category winds of up to category 2,"" Guthrie said.

He added that for anything stronger, evacuation would be necessary.

""When we have that situation, we will have to do an evacuation, and it's coming upon the Florida Division of Emergency Management to be able to take care of that,"" Guthrie said.

Florida lawmakers demand clarity

Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a vocal critic of the facility, toured Alligator Alcatraz on July 12 and later referred to it as an ""internment camp.""

Reacting to the redacted plan, she told CBS News Miami: ""We cannot go by just blacked-out information in a 30-page document and just trust the DeSantis administration.""

She emphasized the need for accountability and clarity.

""This is what is unacceptable. We absolutely need to have a clear, written, confirmed plan in hand from the Division of Emergency Management and ICE, who are responsible for these detainees at the end of the day,"" Wasserman Schultz said.

The Metropolitan Police has since imposed conditions on the protest and counter-protest outside the Thistle City Barbican Hotel in Islington.

The protest was organised by local residents under the banner ""Thistle Barbican needs to go - locals say no"".

The group of several hundred people waved union flags and banners, and one man chanted: ""Get these scum off our streets.""

A man wearing an England football shirt was detained by police after getting into an altercation with officers.

There have been nine arrests so far, six of which were for breaching conditions police put on the protests under the Public Order Act. One was for also breaching those conditions, as well as twice assaulting an emergency worker.

Police also arrested a 22-year-old woman for expressing support for Palestine Action.

And a 33-year-old man, who was a part of the anti-immigration demonstration, was arrested for a racially aggravated public order offence.

Rival groups separated by police

Another protest was scheduled in Newcastle on Saturday, outside The New Bridge Hotel, as anti-migrant sentiment ripples through some communities around the country, also flaring up recently in Epping.

The counter-protest in London was organised by local branches of Stand Up To Racism, and supported by former Labour leader and Islington North MP Jeremy Corbyn.

Other community groups including Finsbury Park Mosque and Islington Labour Party were also involved.

Groups online that backed the original protest include ""Patriots of Britain"" and ""Together for the Children"".

At one point, a large group of masked protesters dressed in black, calling themselves anti-fascists, appeared from a side street and marched towards the rival group outside the hotel.

The two groups briefly clashed before police rushed in to separate them.

Why are asylum hotels used?

The government is legally required to provide accommodation and subsistence to destitute asylum seekers while their claims are being decided, most of whom are prohibited from working.

A jump in the use of hotels since 2020 has been attributed to the impacts of the COVID pandemic, a backlog in unresolved asylum cases, and an increase in the number of migrants crossing the Channel in small boats.

However, the number of asylum seekers living in hotels has fallen recently, from 38,079 at the end of 2024 to 32,345 at the end of March 2025, according to the Refugee Council.

How police tried to keep groups apart

The police imposed conditions on both groups in London to prevent ""serious disorder"" and minimise disruption to the community.

Those in the anti-asylum hotel protest were told to remain within King Charles Square, and to gather not before 1pm and wrap up by 4pm.

Those in the counter-protest were to required to stay in an area in Lever Street, and assemble only between 12pm and 4pm, but were still in eye and ear shot of the other group.

Chief Superintendent Clair Haynes, in charge of the policing operation, said: ""We have been in discussions with the organisers of both protests in recent days, building on the ongoing engagement between local officers, community groups and partners.

""We understand that there are strongly held views on all sides.

""Our officers will police without fear or favour, ensuring those exercising their right to protest can do so safely, but intervening at the first sign of actions that cross the line into criminality.""

Both groups of protesters gathered near the Thistle City Barbican hotel in Islington, north London.

Police later said that a number of arrests had been made after scuffles broke out.

The Metropolitan police wrote on X that officers had cleared a junction where counter-protesters had assembled in breach of the conditions in place.

“There have been nine arrests so far, with seven for breaching Public Order Act conditions,” the force said.

The police said the anti-hotel protest was organised by a number of people under the banner “Thistle Barbican needs to go – locals say no”, but it has since been endorsed by groups from outside the area.

Online groups that have voiced support for the protest include Patriots of Britain and Together for the Children.

One speaker at the anti-hotel protest, which had a turnout of about 100 people, claimed counter-protesters had been paid by “the Labour government and the trade unions” to attend.

Some of those who had gathered across the road from the hotel wore Mega (Make England great again) hats and one man was heard chanting “Get these scum off our streets” towards the hotel.

Directly outside the hotel, hundreds of people attended a counter-protest organised by Stand Up to Racism and supported by the former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is the MP for Islington North, located on the other side of the borough. They far outnumbered the anti-hotel protesters.

Some people in the hotel could be seen watching the demonstration from their windows. Sarah Bailey, 63, who is retired, held a sign that said: “To everyone in the hotel, you are valued, wanted [and] welcome.

She said: “I know somebody that has connections with this hotel. I thought it was so important, because I realised they would be looking out of the windows, that we send a positive sign saying you are all these three things.

“I think it’s so important to show people that have come here seeking safety and protection that they are welcome and to stand up to those who scare and bully them.”

Pat Prendergast, 21, said: “I want people to feel safe. I think the [anti-hotel protesters] over there are making people feel unsafe. I want to stand up in solidarity and say that, you know, we want people here.”

Manchester was the scene of further clashes between rival protesters later on Saturday.

Demonstrators calling for mass “remigration” gathered in the city centre for a march organised by the far-right Britain First group, which was confronted by anti-racism groups.

The groups clashed briefly at the start of the protest before being split up police, according to an AFP journalist at the scene.

“Send them back, don’t let them in – just stop them coming in, we’ve got hotels full of immigrants and we’ve got our own homeless people in the streets begging for food but nowhere to live,” said protester Brendan O’Reilly, 66.

Counter-protester Judy, a 60-year-old retired nurse, told AFP she was there “because I don’t want to see people full of hate on the streets of Manchester”.

She added: “Do they want them all to go back or is it just people with brown skin?

437,210,Dream turns to nightmare for midwest town in grip of US migrant crackdown,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/02/immigration-crackdown-hamilton-ohio,2025-08-02T12:00:12Z,The Guardian,GB,migrant,"For 50 long years, life in Hamilton, a town of 63,000 people a half-hour north of Cincinnati, was in decline.

Factories closed and thousands of residents moved away to Cincinnati, Columbus and beyond. The scourge of the opioid epidemic during the early 2000s sucked the life out of Butler county’s seat of government.

But then, slowly, immigrants came to town. And things began to get better.

Inside Mary’s Comida Casera, an unadorned Mexican restaurant serving Guanajuato food on Hamilton’s southside, a telenovela plays on a pair of televisions while two elementary-age kids watch cartoons on a tablet in the corner.

The restaurant, formerly a 136-year-old residential property, along with dozens of Latin American cafes, stores and businesses in the Jefferson and Riverview neighborhoods have helped bring life back to Hamilton’s southside.

This month, the community’s growing presence was acknowledged when a huge mural titled Viva el Sueño – live the dream – was inaugurated in the Jefferson neighborhood.

“As a brown woman who’s called this city home for over two decades, seeing public art that reflects our stories, struggles and dreams was incredibly moving,” says Mitzi Hernandez, a community leader who moved from Mexico City to Hamilton 23 years ago.

“It felt like we were finally being seen.”

Nearly four in 10 residents in a host of census tracts immediately west and south of downtown Hamilton identify as Hispanic. Despite its relatively small size, the number of people in the city who speak a language other than English at home is almost double the Ohio average.

Not only are immigrants contributing to the renewed vibrancy of life in Hamilton through festivals and community outreach work, their income, property and business tax dollars are padding the coffers of local and state authorities.

Fear in the heart of a new American community

But in the center of the neighborhood, a stone’s throw across a grassy area from Mary’s Comida Casera, lies a place that’s increasingly striking fear into the hearts of Hamilton’s immigrants: the Butler county jail.

A report by the Journal-News newspaper that analyzed the jail roster on 8 July found that of the 384 people detained at that time, more than 90% were there on immigration-related charges.

“There’s a real and growing concern,” says Hernandez.

“This fear isn’t limited to just the Hispanic community – it impacts all immigrant groups.”

The jail is run by Richard Jones, an outspoken sheriff who among his long list of anti-immigration policies recently joked that while Florida has “Alligator Alcatraz”, his town has a “swamp squad” – posting images of inflatable crocodiles at the jail to his Facebook page this month. Many locals and rights groups called the posts “cruel”.

Jones and his populist, anti-immigrant messaging enjoy significant support among the local population. Since 2004, he has won every election for sheriff, often prevailing by three-to-one margins or running unopposed. He has appeared on Fox News calling for the death penalty for drug dealers.

But his controversial views go beyond mere rhetoric.

The detaining of hundreds of people on immigration charges earns the jail more than $24,000 a day or $720,000 a month in fees paid by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) – on top of $36 an hour in transportation fees the jail charges Ice.

At this month’s Butler County Fair, the sheriff’s office display included two mangled cars that were involved in a fatal crash last year caused by an undocumented migrant from Mexico whose blood alcohol level was more than twice the legal driving limit. Why it picked this and not any one of the other 31 fatal crashes that happened in the county last year isn’t apparent – emails, calls, voicemails and an in-person visit to the jail by the Guardian failed to secure an interview with Jones.

On the other side of the jail walls is Ayman Soliman, an Egyptian-born, Cincinnati-based imam who was detained this month following the termination of his longstanding asylum status.

His confinement on 9 July, allegedly related to membership of a group purportedly linked to the Muslim Brotherhood – an organization outlawed in Egypt but not by the United States – has sparked recriminations, mounting fear and anger, and violent responses to protests in south-west Ohio.

Soliman’s detention and the outpouring of anger that has followed are emblematic of the wider split in American society, between those who believe the repressive policies of the Trump administration are key to keeping the country safe, and those who think migrants are a cornerstone of the American way of life.

During a court hearing on 22 July, Soliman appeared by video link in a yellow-and-white prison jumpsuit wearing brown glasses and a salt-and-pepper beard. When asked by the immigration judge whether he needed an interpreter he declined.

Soliman’s calm demeanor during the hearing belies what’s at stake for him.

Should he be deported to Egypt, he could face the death penalty; this month, an Egyptian news outlet accused him of being a leading member of the Muslim Brotherhood, which he has vehemently denied.

Cincinnati seethes

His predicament has fueled a groundswell of anger linked to police beatings, felony charges and seemingly impromptu firings.

On 17 July, Madeline Fening and photography intern Lucas Griffith, two CityBeat journalists, were among 15 people arrested on felony rioting charges following an until-then peaceful protest in downtown Cincinnati against Soliman’s detention.

Footage of the arrests shows the demonstrators walking across the John A Roebling Bridge before Kentucky police, whose jurisdiction extends across the city’s Ohio River bridges, repeatedly punch, shoot pepper balls and violently subdue several participants.

While the felony charges initially filed against the reporters have since been dropped (police claimed the journalists “knowingly participated in a riot”), they still face several misdemeanor charges.

In an environment in which the Trump administration has repeatedly vowed to go after elements of the media it deems are hostile to its positions, press freedom groups have assailed the charges.

“Our clients were doing their jobs and should have never been arrested in the first place,” said William Sharp, senior staff attorney for the ACLU of Kentucky, which is defending the journalists.

“A free press is critical to a functioning democracy, and those members of the press who, like our clients, merely cover a story enjoy the full protection of the US and Kentucky constitutions to do so. We look forward to zealously defending them in court.”

The journalists and others face a preliminary hearing on 14 August.

“Journalists and journalism are under threat … It is disappointing that our efforts to cover a protest were deliberately misinterpreted as rioting,” says Ashley Moor, editor of CityBeat, in a statement provided through the ACLU of Kentucky.

“The suggestion that we were rioting was baseless and designed to intimidate us into silence and complicity.”

All the while, the Kenton county police department has placed Zachary Stayton, the officer who repeatedly punched protest participant Brandon Hill, on administrative leave with pay, pending an investigation. Stayton had been previously the subject of a 2023 lawsuit for excessive use of force.

At a preliminary hearing for Hill, who was hospitalized due to the severity of his injuries and who is one of four protestors still facing felony rioting charges, the judge declined to view the video of the punching, stating, “The officer’s testimony is sufficient.”

‘This is my dream job’

Nor have Soliman’s former colleagues escaped apparent punishment for speaking out about his predicament.

For the past decade, the Rev Lizzy Diop worked as a chaplain at the Cincinnati Children’s hospital, four of those years spent alongside Soliman.

“Cincinnati Children’s has patients from around the world and quite a few from the Middle East. It’s a big thing to travel to a new country with a new culture to get medical care – it’s the most stressful time of their lives,” says Diop, who is one of three people Soliman has asked to be allowed to visit him in jail.

“The delight in somebody’s eyes, and the joy they take in [caring for] the kids; he had that.”

When Diop heard that Soliman had been detained, she was shocked.

“He’s not somebody who talks a lot about himself, but early on, he said: ‘I came from Egypt to the United States to save my life.’”

Five days after his detention, she visited Soliman at the jail. Days later, after being interviewed by a local television station – a move she believed was explicitly cleared by her employers – Diop was fired from the hospital.

“I briefly talked to my manager and director, and we decided I would take PTO and meet off-campus and not wear any [hospital] gear [for the television interview],” she says.

“I was talking about a former employee and some particular interaction about visiting a friend who was incarcerated.” When Diop arrived at work the morning after the interview aired, her director told her she was facing serious disciplinary action for violating media policy.

“This is my dream job. It’s a huge part of my identity. I felt like my world, my life, my self had been torn apart,” she says.

“I’ve been here for 10 years, and I’ve never had a disciplinary action; I got an ‘exceeds expectations’ review weeks before I was fired. I’ve done nothing but good work,” she says.

Diop is still at a loss as to why she was fired.

“Have I messed with a donor? Have I caused [the hospital] to fear repercussions from the Trump administration? I don’t have an answer, but those are the two things that I thought of that could have happened.”

Diop isn’t alone.

Days after Adam Allen, another chaplain at Cincinnati Children’s hospital, attended the vigil that preceded the bridge protest, the hospital fired him.

“They’re firing people for speaking out,” Allen told the Cincinnati Enquirer.

Cincinnati Children’s hospital is regarded as one of the top hospitals in the US and receives hundreds of millions of federal government dollars every year for treatment and research. In March, the hospital was one of three healthcare facilities investigated by the federal government on discrimination charges for programs aimed at helping students from minority backgrounds.

“We don’t comment on current or former personnel,” responded a Cincinnati Children’s hospital spokesperson to the Guardian’s query asking why Diop and Allen were fired.

Back in Hamilton, leaders in the Hispanic communities are further panicked by the move last month to allow local law enforcement officers in Butler county to do the job of Ice agents such as detaining and arresting people suspected to be undocumented immigrants. At least 10 Butler county deputies have become certified Ice agents having taken part in a 40-hour training program.

With nearly three-quarters of Hamilton’s foreign-born population not US citizens, an overwhelming majority of the community is living in fear.

“There’s anxiety, especially as we see Ice activity increasing in other states,” says Hernandez.

“But our community is incredibly resilient. We’ve faced hardship before. Moving to a new country in search of a better life takes courage, and despite fear, people continue to push forward. The most important thing we can do is come together.”

There are signs that Republicans in Butler county, where almost 63% of voters backed Trump in November’s presidential election, are growing uneasy with Jones’s and the White House’s anti-immigrant drive.

On Friday, the Butler county prosecutor, Mike Gmoser, a self-declared “lifelong conservative Republican”, warned of “potential liability” and legal implications for county leaders and authorities for imprisoning hundreds of people on immigration rather than criminal charges, and said he had sought the opinion of the state attorney general.

Lucy Connolly was jailed for 31 months in October

The wife of a former Tory county councillor imprisoned for a social media post calling for migrant accommodation to be torched on the day of the Southport tragedy is due for early release. The Court of Appeal has determined that Lucy Connolly, 41, had no intention of encouraging violence through her message stating ""set fire to all the f****** hotels full of the b******* for all I care"".

‌



Connolly, who worked as a childminder prior to her conviction, will walk free from HMP Peterborough in August having completed 40% of her term, according to the Mirror. She was handed a 31-month prison sentence in October for the post, which garnered over 300,000 views before being removed.

‌



The mum was found guilty of stirring up racial hatred amid widespread ""serious disorder"" following the deaths of three youngsters in Southport, reports Lancs Live. False information spread across social platforms claimed the perpetrator was an asylum seeker.

‌



Connolly's complete message stated: ""Mass deportation now, set fire to all the f****** hotels full of the b******* for all I care... if that makes me racist so be it."" Her punishment, delivered at Birmingham Crown Court, aimed ""to both punish and deter"".

Nevertheless, her husband, ex-West Northamptonshire councillor Raymond Connolly, joined other politicians in expressing outrage. Nigel Farage has previously advocated for her release, labelling her prison sentence as ""absolutely excessive"".

‌



Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said: ""People have received less time in jail - or no time - for actual physical and sexual assaults.""

However, Sir Keir Starmer has defended the sentence, stating he would ""always support"" the UK court system.

But Connolly, from Northampton, is expected to be released next month, having served just 40 per cent of her term. One of Connolly's mates said she would be ""with a glass of Whispering Angel in hand"" this time in August, according to the Evening Standard.

But behind the trees flanking one of the carriageways was the reason hundreds had come - another hotel being used to house asylum seekers.

Just as towns and cities around the country have seen protests in recent days, most prominently in Epping in Essex where at least 18 arrests have been made, this time the focus was the Brook Hotel.

It started peacefully - bar the beeping of horns of passing cars and the chants from protesters on both sides.

But in a flash, it all changed.

Witnesses say one of the pro-immigration protesters had approached the much larger group wearing a balaclava and in seconds the pent-up fury spilt over as an angry crowd surged towards the police, shouting and swearing.

Some tried and failed to hold back the furious crowd urging peace as a small group of police and protesters rolled down a verge, while backup officers emerged from a side road.

But as quickly as it started, it was all over - an intense five minutes that seemed to take the wind out of their anger.

Trying to find anyone willing to speak was almost impossible: ""We don't talk to the mainstream media,"" a common phrase.

But David Beane, from nearby Costessey, a veteran and the father of an eight-year-old boy, had clear views he wanted to share.

""I know homeless people from the forces. I got out of the force, no dental treatment, I can't get a doctors. They get everything,"" he said.

""I'm all up for immigrants coming, but sign the paperwork. You show who you are, you come in, you abide by our laws.""

It was David's first time at a protest. Another local man attending was Glen.

""They're in there, free rent, free everything,"" he said.

Referring to the hotel, he added: ""Do you know they are even getting meal tickets to go in that pub with, and they supply meals in there?""

There have been protests in nearby Diss too this week.

The Park Hotel in the town has now informed the Home Office that it will close altogether if it is ever made to house single men rather than families at the location.

Back in Norwich, torrential rain was enough to bring an end to the day's event. Only a few stragglers remained two-and-a-half hours after it had all begun.

440,120,European plans to send asylum seekers to offshore centers in disarray after top court ruling,https://krdo.com/news/2025/08/03/european-plans-to-send-asylum-seekers-to-offshore-centers-in-disarray-after-top-court-ruling/,2025-08-03T11:25:55Z,KRDO,US,asylum,"By Barbie Latza Nadeau, CNN

Rome (CNN) — European countries hoping to mirror Italy’s controversial practice of sending some asylum seekers rescued at sea to overseas deportation centers have been dealt a setback by Europe’s top court.

On Friday, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that while Italy could still utilize the centers it runs in the Albanian cities of Shengiin and Gjader, who can be sent there must be more closely examined to ensure that asylum seekers aren’t being sent back to dangerous situations in their home countries.

The court said that a country of origin can only be considered “safe” after it has been “subject to effective judicial review,” and that a country must be demonstrably safe for all its population, including vulnerable or marginalized groups.

The ECJ ruling will almost certainly impact new EU asylum regulations, which are set to take effect next June and are designed to allow member states to create their own “safe” country lists to expedite and outsource the asylum process.

The EU’s own list, meant to be a guide, includes Bangladesh, Columbia, Egypt, India, Kosovo, Morocco and Tunisia, despite human rights campaigners warning that those countries aren’t safe for all who live there.

“The proposed EU list of ‘safe countries of origin’ deems certain countries, from which 20% or fewer applicants are granted international protection in the EU, to be safe,” Amnesty International said in a July statement. “However, the fact that up to 20% of those applying for international protection from these countries are recognized as refugees indicates that these places are in fact not safe for all,” it added.

The ECJ ruling – which was based on two Bangladeshi asylum seekers who were detained in Albania but argued returning to Bangladesh was unsafe – comes as several European countries have expressed interest in developing their own deportation schemes like the Italian-Albanian partnership.

While that partnership, a multi-million-euro investment of detention centers and “return hubs” in a non-EU country, has been viewed by some countries as a potential blueprint for success, a recent study by the University of Bari found that the Italian scheme has, so far, cost the country more than €74.2 million (approximately $86 million).

The study called the scheme “the most costly, inhumane, and useless instrument in the history of Italian migration policies.”

Still, European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and then European Council president Charles Michel lauded Italy’s 2023 landmark agreement, and in May 2024, the EU established a set of reforms designed to streamline Europe’s approach to managing migration and asylum, particularly around migrants from so-called “safe” countries.

Calling it “fair but firm,” the pact lays out wide-ranging reforms designed to ease the burden on countries that have historically taken the most asylum-seekers among the EU’s 27 member states.

Whether this ECJ ruling will dissuade the development of the detentions hubs remains to be seen.

Italy’s far-right Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni criticized the court’s decision as short sighted, saying that it “weakens policies to combat mass illegal immigration and protect national borders.”

“This is a development that should concern everyone – including the political forces rejoicing today over the ruling – because it further reduces the already limited scope for governments and parliaments to regulate and administer migration,” she said.

Meanwhile, in Italy’s detention centers in Albania, the lives of nearly a dozen people from countries deemed safe, including Egypt and Bangladesh, hang in the balance.

442,37,Court limits Trump's asylum crackdown at the U.S.-Mexico border,https://www.cbsnews.com/texas/news/court-limits-trump-asylum-crackdown-us-mexico-border/,2025-08-02T17:45:41Z,CBS News,US,asylum,"A panel of federal judges on Friday limited President Trump's effort to close the U.S. asylum system at the southern border, saying his administration can't unilaterally suspend laws that bar the U.S. from deporting migrants to places where they would face persecution or torture.

The ruling centers on a proclamation issued by Mr. Trump just hours after he returned to the White House in January, ordering the closure of the asylum system. U.S. border officials have relied on the order to summarily expel those entering the country illegally, without allowing them to request asylum. Mr. Trump justified the sweeping measure on the grounds that the country is facing an ""invasion"" of migrants.

The three-judge panel at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit lifted its administrative pause on a July ruling from a federal judge who found Mr. Trump's proclamation defied U.S. laws that require the federal government to hear the claims of migrants who want to apply for humanitarian protection out of fear that they could be harmed if deported.

That ruling by U.S. District Judge Randolph Moss struck down the Trump administration's asylum ban and would've required officials to stop enforcing it on a legal class comprised of migrants who are or will be in the U.S.

While it lifted its stay on Moss' ruling, the D.C. Circuit panel also narrowed his order, limiting the class members eligible for relief to asylum-seekers already on American soil while Mr. Trump's decree is in effect. The appellate court also limited the scope of Moss' ruling, partially granting a request from the Trump administration.

The panel allowed the Trump administration to continue using the president's proclamation to deny migrants access to the U.S. asylum system, noting that U.S. law permits, but does not require, the government to grant asylum to those who prove they could be persecuted because of their race, religion, politics or other factors.

But the panel also said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to prevent migrants from applying for other forms of humanitarian protections that the U.S. is legally required to give to certain migrants fleeing persecution and torture. They're known as ""withholding of removal"" and protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Those protections have a higher legal threshold than asylum, but unlike asylum, they are mandatory, not discretionary, and must be granted to those who meet the requirements.

The panel was made up of Circuit Judges Patricia Millett and Cornelia Pillard, who were appointed by former President Barack Obama, as well as Gregory G. Katsas, an appointee of Mr. Trump. Each judge filed their own statements in the case, with Pillard and Katsas disagreeing with some aspects of the ruling.

While they had some disagreements, all three judges said Mr. Trump's proclamation could not be used to ignore laws around ""withholding of removal"" or Convention Against Torture protections. Pillard said she would've also blocked the administration from denying migrants the right to apply for asylum.

The judges scheduled expedited proceedings to decide the merits of the case, asking both the government and the advocates challenging Mr. Trump's proclamation to file briefs through Sept. 26.

The lawsuit that triggered Friday's decision was filed by the American Civil Liberties Union and other advocates, who have denounced the Trump administration's border crackdown as a draconian policy that has sent migrants to harm's way.

""The President secured the border in record time at an unprecedented level by using every available legal tool provided by Congress,"" Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin told CBS News in a statement on Saturday. ""A rogue district judge took those tools away, threatening the safety and security of Americans and ignoring a Supreme Court decision issued only days earlier admonishing district courts for granting nationwide injunctions. The Trump Administration is committed to restoring integrity to our immigration system and to our justice system.""

Trump administration officials have credited the president's proclamation and other actions — including the deployment of thousands of additional troops to the southern border — for a historic drop in illegal crossings there.

In July, just 4,600 migrants were caught crossing the southern border illegally, the lowest monthly tally recorded by Border Patrol and a figure the Biden administration reported daily during many months.

560,192,Former ICE official worried agency will go on Proud Boys hiring spree.,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2025/07/masked-ice-agents-secret-proud-boys-trump.html,2025-07-17T17:49:28Z,Slate Magazine,US,deportation,"Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.

In the 22 years since Immigration and Customs Enforcement was created to identify and eliminate border security threats, Congress has again and again failed to reform the badly broken immigration system that ICE polices. That failure has fostered a culture of grievance at ICE and its sister agencies, and Donald Trump’s hard-line immigration position has only indulged that siege mentality. Now, in an effort to push agents to achieve his mass deportation agenda, Trump has granted the agency a massive, record-breaking cash infusion, while in the same stroke, he eliminated the oversight bodies that are supposed to regulate ICE’s actions. One former top ICE official says that there’s a worryingly real possibility that the incoming agents will be seeded from “Proud Boys and other insurrectionists.” Whether or not that nightmare scenario is realized, the results of Trump’s agent expansion and oversight contraction will likely spell disaster for civil liberties across the country.

Since its inception in 2002, ICE has become the second-largest investigative agency in the federal government, and today it has about 21,000 employees and an annual budget of $8 billion. For years, ICE has been accused of using problematic tactics when enforcing immigration law, a trend that has skyrocketed since Trump took office again this year. By March, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem had announced that the three oversight divisions within DHS were effectively shutting down: the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, and the Office of the Citizenship and Immigration Services Ombudsman. These were established by Congress as a way to implement oversight of DHS and focused on protecting detainees’ civil rights and ensuring they were receiving immigration-related benefits. Noem fired a majority of their staff by claiming their work was creating “roadblocks” to immigration enforcement.

The Robert F. Kennedy Human Rights group sued, forcing the oversight bodies to remain open, though key positions are either empty or being held by Trump-aligned figures—Troup Hemenway, a former leader on Project 2025, was appointed acting officer for the Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties.

Meanwhile, the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill awarded ICE $29.9 billion for enforcement and deportation operations—a threefold increase of their current annual budget. Even more funding will be provided to hire 10,000 new immigration enforcement agents, intended to push “the rate of deportations to reach as high as 1 million per year,” Noem announced. All in all, DHS, which oversees ICE, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, and Customs and Border Protection, secured $165 billion in the new legislation.

Scott Shuchart, former assistant director of ICE under the Biden administration, does not believe the agency is capable of spending this money responsibly. “This administration is led by criminals, and they’re going to keep doing unlawful and terrible things,” he told me. It’s hard to keep track of just how unprecedented, expansive, and legally questionable the Trump administration’s push on immigration enforcement has been, from arresting immigrants at courthouses and revoking legal status from hundreds of thousands of people to targeting birthright citizenship. It’s led to a massive wave of lawsuits, which the federal government is mostly losing.

ICE is largely the face of these actions, with about 9,000 people working under Enforcement and Removal Operations, which are the officers tasked with enforcing civil interior immigration law. They go into local communities, identify immigrants being targeted by the administration, and then go on to arrest and detain them. Since Trump took office, these officers have been wearing masks to obscure their identities as they arrest people, inciting widespread fear and confusion across American communities. Some states have pushed back by introducing legislation that would ban law enforcement from wearing masks or a personal disguise while performing their duties. A group of detainees also filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration arguing that masks enable ICE to flout the Constitution and federal law.

The OBBB has appropriated funding to double this department to 20,000, which Shuchart is certain will drastically change the agency’s culture. “I’m very worried that they are going to be Proud Boys and other insurrectionists and hoodlums,” Shuchart said. “What self-respecting person who wants a meaningful career in law enforcement would go to work at the ERO right now, knowing the way ERO comports itself?” Hiring ERO officers typically takes months, as applicants must go through a security clearance process and then spend time at a training academy. Shuchart explained that Border Patrol officers traditionally make up a large share of ERO officers, since that unit is considered an entry path into federal law enforcement and hires younger applicants with less experience.

From his time at ICE, Shuchart said ERO’s culture was already one of grievance and self-pity. The job was considered difficult; they canvass the entire country for immigrants who are here without legal status, and do so with too few resources. They resent sanctuary cities, which are local jurisdictions that don’t work with federal immigration efforts, feeling that they put ICE in danger and made their job harder. And if there was a death of a migrant in a detention center, it was “rarely anyone’s fault,” said Shuchart, with officers blaming the detention center’s conditions on inadequate funding.

During Trump’s first term, ProPublica discovered a Facebook group made up of employees of CBP in which participants, including a CBP supervisor, made sexualized posts about members of Congress and used degrading language to describe migrants. Since Trump took office, the culture has further shifted, with officers working around the clock under pressure to meet impossibly high arrest quotas. One career ICE official told the Atlantic: “It’s miserable.”

The toxicity is spreading to local law enforcement, as federal agents raid their communities completely masked and unidentifiable, which ends up eroding residents’ trust in the police.

However, the Trump administration’s approach to immigration, manipulating existing laws and often straight-up violating them, is not exactly new. Disturbing reports of abuse at immigration detention centers surfaced under the Biden administration, problematic family detention tactics were used by the Obama administration, and Trump’s first administration pursued a notorious zero-tolerance policy that resulted in thousands of parents being deported while their children remained in the U.S. “Our system makes no sense whatsoever and serves nobody’s interests,” Shuchart said. “The only thing that’s ever going to work is legislation.”

Shuchart believes the Trump administration’s solution, which has thus far included firing staff, eliminating guardrails, and throwing billions more dollars at an overwhelmed agency so it can meet the president’s mass deportation goal as quickly as possible, is pure fantasy.

445,204,Court limits Italy’s fast-track return of rejected asylum seekers to ‘safe’ countries,https://apnews.com/article/italy-eu-court-migrants-ecj-b8b681b5329321d006d1fea0b2d76b9e,2025-08-01T16:07:59Z,The Associated Press,US,asylum,"ROME (AP) — Judges at the European Union’s top court ruled Friday that Italy may fast-track the deportation of migrants to countries it deems “safe,” but only under certain conditions.

The Court of Justice of the European Union was asked to weigh in on whether Italy’s accelerated asylum process — used to swiftly return migrants from countries not experiencing war or major crises — complies with EU law.

The case centered on two Bangladeshi nationals rescued at sea by the Italian navy last year and transferred to a detention center in Albania. Because Bangladesh appears on Italy’s list of “safe” countries, their asylum claims were fast-tracked and ultimately rejected.

Italy’s government, led by Premier Giorgia Meloni, introduced the fast-track system and offshore detention centers in Albania as part of a broader strategy to reduce migration. Both measures have drawn widespread criticism.

Italian courts have ruled against the policies and referred several cases to the EU’s court in Luxembourg for clarification.

Opposition politicians say the scheme is expensive, complicated and damaging to migrants’ rights. A non-governmental delegation observing the process in Albania says it illegally deprives migrants of assistance during their asylum procedures.

The Luxembourg-based court on Friday said that while having a fast-track procedure doesn’t violate EU law, the designation of safe countries must be subject to judicial scrutiny so migrants can challenge their asylum decisions.

Meloni’s office expressed surprise at the ruling, insisting Italy’s migration policy is the purview of the executive and legislative branches and shouldn’t be subject to judicial review.

The decision “weakens policies to counter mass illegal immigration and defend national borders,” Meloni’s office said in a statement, adding that it “further reduces the already narrow margins of autonomy of governments and parliaments” to control migration.

Italian Justice Minister Carlo Nordio later added that the ruling “recognizes Italy’s right to designate a third country as a ‘safe country of origin’ even through a legislative act,” but he, too, was critical of the call for judicial reviews.

Advocates for migrants, however, heralded the decision. The Italian branch of Doctors Without Boarders said the decision created “a clear principle” that EU member states cannot declare a country safe without judicial review. “It is no longer possible to use opaque legislative acts lacking verifiable sources to justify the swift rejection of protection applications,” the group said.

The court ruling also noted a country cannot be deemed safe if there is insufficient protection for vulnerable groups. The country in question must be “safe for its entire population and not just for part of it,” the 22-page decision says.

An Italian court held last year that migrants from Bangladesh and Egypt couldn’t be immediately returned because those countries are not safe enough.

Judges at the Rome District Court, which referred the case to Luxembourg, will have the final say in determining whether the procedure was correctly applied for the two Bangladeshi nationals. ___

446,213,Lopez: ICE is redefining detention as an open-ended threat,https://www.mercurynews.com/2025/07/30/lopez-ice-is-redefining-detention-as-an-open-ended-threat/,2025-07-30T10:30:55Z,The Mercury News,US,asylum,"Mandatory detention is the newest and potentially most powerful weapon in the White House’s arsenal for turbo-charging deportations. Once arrested, immigrants without legal status will, with few exceptions, be held in custody until they are deported by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. That means they are no longer eligible, as in the past, to post bond at a hearing and have an immigration judge decide their fate.

ICE alone will be the decider.

That threatens to transform temporary detention centers into long-term prisons — and to strip immigrants of the constitutional rights that are due to every person in the U.S., regardless of legal status.

Acting ICE Director Todd M. Lyons wrote in a July memo obtained by the Washington Post that immigrants should be detained “for the duration of their removal proceedings,” a process that can stretch out for months, or even years, given judicial backlogs. That could affect millions of immigrants.

It is an aggressive move from an agency that is becoming increasingly reckless in its handling of immigrants. The policy is already expected to draw a court challenge questioning the constitutionality of sidestepping judges.

David Bier, director of immigration studies for the libertarian Cato Institute, told me it is part of a strategy to gain “total control” over the removal process. “Judges make an independent determination based on facts,” he said. “They’re not going to just do what ICE wants.” Once the norm, such independence now seems to strike this administration as an intolerable act of defiance.

Even before the new policy was announced, it had become common since Trump took office for judges to approve dismissal of deportation proceedings against an immigrant only to have ICE officers arrest the person in the court’s hallway and fast-track their deportation.

Perversely, this new tactic punishes the very immigrants who stand the best chance to become eligible for asylum or another legal status, Bier said, adding that “these are the immigrants who usually have clean records, steady jobs. They are complying.”

‘Easy marks’

That compliance also makes them easy marks for a dragnet that makes little distinction between high- and low-priority removals. ICE agents struggling to meet the quotas of Stephen Miller, the White House deputy chief of staff, are looking for quick wins. It is far easier to arrest someone who shows up to a regular check-in than to hunt down a criminal who left no forwarding address.

ICE is still far short of the holding facilities needed for its bumped-up enforcement efforts, but the agency has made its intentions clear: Temporary tent facilities such as “Alligator Alcatraz” in the Florida Everglades may become the new template, even as existing detention centers fill to bursting. In the tax-and-spending law signed at the beginning of July, the agency received funding for a capacity of 100,000 beds.

“The idea,” Bier said, “is to force them into a choice of being detained for months or even years, or just give up and leave.”

This is just wrong; someone with a good case for asylum should not be facing imprisonment until they self-deport. Stepped-up detentions, while falling well short of White House goals, have already resulted in reports of overcrowding, inadequate food and lack of medical attention — all for people who, in many instances, face no criminal charges.

Under normal circumstances, those in detention would get top priority for a hearing within one to two weeks, according to acting ICE director Lyons. But a backlog of an estimated 3.5 million cases makes that unlikely. So does the shortage of immigration judges.

Although the White House has said it will hire more judges, since Trump took office, more than 100 immigration judges have resigned or been fired.

More beds, detentions

Democratic U.S. Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois said at least one of those firings was punishment for a judge who “took time to show me the court and explain its functions.” The judge, he said, later received a Justice Department email that stated immigration judges should not be talking directly with members of Congress.

Durbin, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, called the judge’s abrupt termination an “abuse of power.” More beds mean more detentions. Fewer judges mean those immigrants might be imprisoned longer — a lot longer. And those who believe they have the best shot at legal status will be the most determined to gut it out, for as long as it takes.

The result could be the deliberate, long-term imprisonment of individuals not convicted of a crime.

Under the Constitution, both immigrants and citizens have a right to due process and equal treatment under the law. If the Constitution is to have any meaning at all, those rights cannot become just another casualty.

Congress has given ICE a budget that is 62% larger than that of the entire federal prison system, according to calculations by the non-partisan American Immigration Council. Under the new tax law, its budget for enforcement and removal operations will triple. ICE now has ample resources to do this the right way: Hunt down criminals and deport them. Hire more judges who are well-qualified and independent. Insist on humane treatment in what should be short-term detention facilities. There are no longer excuses not to do so, and the American public should demand it.

447,210,‘Our north is the south’: Softball leagues flourish in Brazilian city as Cuban arrivals outnumber Venezuelans for first time,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/02/cuban-asylum-seekers-outnumber-venezuelans-brazil,2025-08-02T12:00:10Z,The Guardian,GB,asylum,"If he had been able to choose, Roberto Hernandez Tello, 59, would have gone to the United States last May, when he left Cuba in search of a better life.

However, due to Donald Trump’s anti-immigration policies, he ended up in Curitiba, in southern Brazil, 3,940 miles from his native Camagüey.

Thousands of his compatriots have arrived in Brazil this year, contributing to a shift in which, for the first time, more Cubans than Venezuelans are applying for asylum in Latin America’s largest country.

“I love Cuba, but with the crisis it’s impossible to live there now,” said Tello. “I have a 31-year-old son who lives in the US. But since Trump scrapped the parole, I chose to come to Brazil,” he added, referring to the US president’s elimination of the humanitarian programme known as CHNV, which had benefited migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela.

For years, Venezuela’s political and economic crises has driven people out of the country, creating a global diaspora of nearly 8 million. However, as of June this year, Brazil has had twice as many asylum requests from Cubans, 19,419, compared with Venezuelans, 9,850.

Cubans typically travel to Guyana or Suriname, countries with less bureaucratic visa processes, before crossing the land border into the northern Brazilian states of Roraima and Amapá.

But many are continuing their journey way down south, particularly to Curitiba – a city home to 1.8 million and the capital of Paraná state – which ranks just behind the northern entry-point towns in Cuban asylum requests.

The city has the highest GDP of the southern state capitals and is known for its strong public transportation, healthcare and education systems.

There are so many Cubans and Venezuelans in Curitiba that they’ve formed two leagues of softball, a sport virtually unknown in football-obsessed Brazil.

About 350 players, split across 16 teams, play the larger-ball, compact version of baseball on makeshift pitches of two parks in São José dos Pinhais, just outside Curitiba.

The catcher of one team, Ernesto Alberto Keiser Limonta, 30, arrived last year. He lives with his wife and is now focused on bringing the rest of the family to join them. “I chose Curitiba because I was told it’s a prosperous, safe city that has a lot of work,” he said.

Almost every Sunday, Limonta takes to the field in full uniform – cap, jersey bearing the flags of Cuba and Brazil, trousers, socks, and cleats without metal studs, to avoid injuries that could prevent someone from working the next day.

Given that the heavy influx of Venezuelans began earlier, they make up most of the players, but the roughly 20 Cubans have managed to form a dedicated Team Cuba.

“There’s a saying among migrants – and now it’s being repeated by Cubans – that our north is the south,” said one Venezuelan, Angel Blanco, 44, who founded one of the leagues.

The movement began last year when – according to the UN Refugee Agency – Brazil became the country with the highest number of Cubans applying for asylum (22,288 applications), ahead of Mexico (17,884) and the US (13,685). The figures could be even higher, as many Cubans struggle even to submit their requests.

Tello, for instance, has been seeking help from the humanitarian NGO José as he still has not been able to book an appointment with the federal police to formally register his request. Only with the protocol, which also serves as an ID, can migrants be officially hired by Brazilian employers.

Appointments must be booked online, and the next available slot wasn’t until November, Tello said. “I’m afraid I’ll run out of money – and if I do, I’ll end up sleeping on the streets. In this cold, I’d be dead within days,” he added, referring to the city’s climate, where temperatures can drop to 5C.

A federal police spokesperson said the gap was “due to high and growing demand” and that “ongoing efforts to expand capacity have not been enough to keep pace with the exponential number of migrants arriving in the region.”

Yaneth Corina Lara Garcia, a Venezuelan who works as an integration assistant at the non-profit organisation Cáritas Curitiba, said: “It’s six months in which, unable to get formal work, Cuban migrants end up vulnerable to exploitation – including modern slavery.”

Another common challenge for Cubans is having their university degrees recognised, which forces many into lower-paid jobs, such as construction or cooking.

Yarismeli Nardo, 36, a psychologist who has lived in Curitiba since 2019, is one of the few to have had her degree recognised. But it wasn’t easy, she says. The Federal University of Paraná opens just one application round per year, requiring a lengthy list of documents – often difficult to obtain in Cuba – as well as exams and interviews.

However, she persisted, and while working as a pharmacy sales assistant, Nardo completed the process. She now spends two days a week working as a psychologist at a clinic and the rest as an IT technician.

Now, six years after she left, Nardo is planning her first holiday back to Cuba.

“I want to save a little money, because my biggest wish is to see my grandmother, who’s 94,” she said. “When I first came here, I felt as if I was nobody – starting from scratch, where no one knew me. Now I feel as if I’m finally catching my breath.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

A man has been arrested on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed terror organisation following a demonstration outside a hotel in Altrincham where asylum seekers are being housed.

‌



Rival protesters clashed outside the Cresta Court hotel on Sunday evening (July 27) prompting a significant police operation. Following the demo, a 25-year-old man was arrested outside another hotel housing asylum seekers in Hoylake, Wirral, on Thursday.

‌



He was arrested on suspicion of inviting support for a proscribed organisation, believed to be National Action. The neo-Nazi group was banned, or 'proscribed', in December 2016. The alleged offence is said to have occurred outside the Cresta Court on Sunday, not the hotel in Hoylake.

‌



At the demo in Altrincham on Sunday, groups waving Union Jack flags which read 'Uniting Britain' and 'The Great Britain National Protest' gathered opposite the Cresta Court hotel on Church Street.

The hotel closed last year, with all future bookings moved to alternative hotels in and around Trafford. It came after the owners of the venue reportedly agreed a deal with Serco.

‌



Counter-protesters also gathered directly outside the venue brandishing banners and signs. Plaques which read 'stop the far right' and 'stand up to racism' were waved as groups shouted across to one another. Chants of 'say it loud, say it clear, refugees are welcome here' were also shouted into a microphone.

Police officers including riot-trained Tactical Aid Unit cops were also at the scene. Officers were seen speaking to members of both groups as insults were exchanged. The protest was also livestreamed on YouTube to thousands of viewers.

Safe to say the definition of mental illness was not the same as it is today. Inmates could end up being committed for anything from promiscuity to poverty.

It was here that Dr Jean-Martin Charcot developed his theory of hysteria, a word whose etymology goes back to the Greek word for uterus. Breaking with a long tradition of doctors who attributed erratic behaviour in women to a wandering womb, Charcot treated hysteria as a neurological disorder. He insisted men could be susceptible too.

In that and other areas, Charcot was a medical pioneer, even if his use of hypnosis, photography and showmanship strike us as eccentric today. We no longer ask patients to perform their illness for a curious audience nor do we recognise his four stages of hysteria.

That conditions in Victorian asylums were less than ideal and that women have had a raw deal due to the slow evolution of psychiatry hardly needs saying. What makes Helena McBurney’s script so riveting is the way it blends misogyny and mental illness into fluid theatrical poetry, blurring the line between medic and patient in a play that is half lecture, half nightmare.

Dressed in silky off-white trousers and a top buttoned up the back like a designer straitjacket, actor Charlotte McBurney gives a high-precision performance that crackles with vulnerability, confusion and intelligence.

Neil Hudson, the Conservative MP for Epping Forest, has signed a letter along with other local politicians urging Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to make The Bell Hotel a priority for urgent decommissioning.

Mr Hudson told Sky News that protests at the site have led to ""deeply troubling and unsettling"" scenes, with people coming from outside the area ""not to support the real concerns of our local community, but to disrupt and cause violence"".

He said: ""This is a crisis that risks boiling over, and for the safety of our community, the government must get a grip on this situation now, and they must listen and act quickly to close the hotel.""

The letter to the home secretary, which requests an urgent meeting, was also signed by neighbouring Conservative MP Alex Burghart, Epping Forest District Council leader Christopher Whitbread, leader of Essex County Council Kevin Bentley, and Police, Fire and Crime Commissioner for Essex Roger Hirst.

It also expresses concerns about the use of the Phoenix Hotel in North Weald, in Mr Burghart's Brentwood and Ongar constituency, to house asylum seekers, which has been subject to alleged arson attacks.

The letter said the sites are ""proving to be entirely unsuitable"" and ""placing an unsustainable strain on police resources"".

They added that this is ""creating significant community tension, and leading to public disorder that is unacceptable to our residents and deeply concerning for the safety of all involved"".

Multiple demonstrations have been held outside The Bell since 13 July after an asylum seeker was charged with allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl.

Hadush Gerberslasie Kebatu, 38, who was charged with sexual assault, denies the allegations. He is due to stand trial in August.

Since the disorder broke out, Essex Police said 14 people have been charged in connection with the protests and there have been 23 arrests, while eight officers have been injured.

One of the injured officers required hospitalisation ""after being struck in the face with a bottle"", the letter from the authorities said.

It said that ""large-scale protests and counter-protests"" have attracted more than 2,000 people on some days and deploying police to the demonstrations is ""putting our ability to maintain public safety at risk"".

""We support the Home Office's wider objective of reducing reliance on hotels and are keen to work with you. However, we urge you to accelerate this process and make The Bell Hotel in Epping a priority for urgent closure,"" the letter added.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves said last month that the government would close all asylum seeker hotels by the end of this parliament but with record numbers still crossing the Channel, it is not clear how this will be achieved or where those awaiting a decision will go.

As Sky's home editor Jason Farrell reports, tensions have also flared in Altrincham near Manchester, where a hotel has been repurposed to house asylum seekers.

Last week, Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News he ""gets the public's frustration"" over asylum hotels.

However, it is not clear if they have immediate plans to shut down The Bell.

Sky News has been testing the mood in Altrincham since locals were first informed last November that the Cresta Court Hotel was being repurposed from accommodating short business stays and local events into lodgings for hundreds of male asylum seekers who crossed the Channel on small boats.

Over the course of eight months there have been angry town meetings, regular low-level protests and last Sunday around 80 people from each side turned up outside the hotel with banners, flags and loudspeakers.

""We stopped the Germans, why can't we stop dinghies,"" says local man Dave Haydock under a St George's cross cap.

""We're paying for them to be in there and there's British people out on the streets,"" added local businessman Steve, who is waving a Union Flag. ""They're not fleeing a war to come to Britain - they're coming from France - they are coming because of all the benefits - and everyone in the UK now knows that.""

Cost, benefits and risk to women are recurring themes.

""These people coming over without any documentation,"" says local Clare Jones as she points in the direction of two schools. ""I'm not a racist. I'm just a concerned mum. I don't feel safe in my own community.""

A man behind a mask who didn't want to appear on camera says the media ""sneers"" at these protests because the media is middle class and ""this is a working-class movement"".

Altrincham is one of Manchester's most affluent towns, but there are much poorer areas close by.

The social demographic at the protests was mixed.

On either side of the A56 I met business owners, nurses, teachers and pensioners.

Both groups were also largely made up of locals.

A handful of social media ""professional"" protesters also turned up, pointing cameras at anything they could film - making selfie videos for their TikTok and YouTube followers.

A small line of police officers was in place to keep the peace.

The counter-protesters forming a line to protect the hotel. Described as ""lefties"" by the anti-migrant demonstrators, the counter-protesters feel that the people opposite are either ""far right, fascists"" or ""being manipulated by the far right"".

Altrincham resident Alison O'Connell said ""this is very frightening"" as she pointed at the anti-migrant demonstrators. ""We are just here to show support for the refugees in the hotel,"" she added.

Counter-protester Steph Phoenix said: ""Knowing personally people in the hotels, I know they are not coming for our money. These people are desperate. They don't come over for a laugh, they are coming over because they are escaping something terrible in their own country.""

Nahella Ashraf, co-chair of Greater Manchester Stand Up To Racism, said: ""There needs to be an honest conversation about what the problems are in society. Refugees are not to blame. People are worried about the cost of living crisis, but it's not caused by refugees. By housing people in these hotels, we've not taken accommodation away from anyone in Britain.""

Migrants disappeared into their rooms during the protest, some peering out of their bedroom windows.

Their voices are rarely heard in this debate.

The next day, hotel security advised them not to talk to us.

Those we did speak to all had stories of fleeing instability and threat. Some had just arrived, others had been here months.

Many were anxious about the protests, but equally not put off from their decision to come.

One said he had recently told a local who had been abusive: ""I struggled to get here. It was just luck you were born here.""

The fears of increased crime expressed by residents in November don't appear to have transpired. But Conservative councillor Nathan Evans, who called the first town meeting, says groups of men in the park, men praying in the public library and warning letters from schools to parents about groups of men near the school gates have all caused ""an unease across the town"". He says he has warned the police of a ""simmering issue"".

Protesters on either side don't agree on much but both see the hotel as a symbol of broken promises from successive governments - a failure to manage migration in a way that doesn't inflame communities. What remains is anger.

Multiple demonstrations have been held outside The Bell Hotel in the Essex town since 13 July after an asylum seeker was charged with allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl.

The number of people charged in connection with demonstrations at the premises now stands at 14, according to police.

Phillip Curson, 52, and Martin Peagram, 33, appeared at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court on Tuesday charged with violent disorder over a 17 July protest outside the hotel.

The demonstration started peacefully but escalated into what officers described as ""scattered incidents of violence"" targeting police and property.

Eight officers were injured and a number of police vehicles were damaged as missiles were thrown.

Curson, of Upminster, east London, gave no indication of plea and was granted conditional bail until an appearance before Chelmsford Crown Court on 26 August.

Prosecutor Sharon Hall said it is alleged Curson had been stamping on a police van and ""lunging and kicking out"" at officers.

Peagram, of Loughton, Essex, indicated a plea of guilty to the charge of violent disorder and was remanded in custody until an appearance before Chelmsford Crown Court in the week beginning 1 September.

On Sunday, three people were arrested at the latest demonstration outside the hotel, as protesters waved union flags while Stand Up To Racism counter-protesters marched to the hotel with signs reading: ""Stop scapegoating refugees and migrants.""

Essex Police said there was an ""escalation of violence"" during protests at the same site on 13, 17, 20 and 24 July, involving hundreds of people.

The protests took place after an asylum seeker was charged with sexual assault after he allegedly attempted to kiss a 14-year-old girl.

454,125,"Contributor: Under Trump, U.S. returns to treating violence against women as a 'private matter'",https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2025-08-03/womens-rights-refugee-gender-human-rights,2025-08-03T14:00:00Z,Los Angeles Times,US,refugee,"The U.S. has been waffling for decades over whether women have a right to refugee protection when fleeing gender-based violence. Under different administrations, the Department of Justice has established and reversed precedents, issued and repealed rulings. But the latest flip-flop by the Trump administration is not just another toggle between rules.

In July, the Trump administration’s high court of immigration, the Board of Immigration Appeals, issued a deeply troubling decision . The ruling held that a “particular social group” — one of the five grounds for refugee protection — cannot be defined by gender, or by gender combined with nationality. The ruling, in a case known as Matter of K-E-S-G- , is binding on all adjudicators across the country.

The legal reasoning is both unpersuasive and alarming. It seeks to return refugee law to an era when violence against women was dismissed as a private matter, not of concern to governments or human rights institutions. It is part of a broader, ongoing assault by the Trump administration on women’s rights and immigrant rights — in this case, attempting to turn back history to 1992.

It was in 1993, at the Vienna Conference on Human Rights , when the catchphrase “women’s rights are human rights” gained global prominence. This was a response to the long-standing focus on the violation of civil and political rights by governments, while much of the violence against women was committed by nonstate actors. Women and girls fleeing gender-based violence were considered outside the bounds of protection. But the Vienna Conference marked a turning point, leading to transformative change in how governments and international bodies addressed gender-based violence — because much of the violence in this world is targeted at women. Laws and policies were adopted worldwide to advance women’s rights, including for those seeking refugee protection.

Under international and U.S. law , a refugee is someone with a well-founded fear of persecution linked to that person’s “race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion,” which are commonly referred to as the protected grounds. Gender is not explicitly listed, and as a result, women fleeing gender-based forms of persecution, such as honor killings, female genital cutting, sexual slavery or domestic violence, were often denied protection, with their risk wrongly categorized as “personal” or “private,” and not connected to one of the protected grounds.

To address the misconception that women are outside the ambit of refugee protection, beginning in 1985 the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees issued a series of guidance documents explaining that although “gender” is not listed as a protected ground, women could often be considered a “particular social group” within a country. The commissioner called on countries that were parties to the international refugee treaty — the 1951 Refugee Convention and its 1967 Protocol — to issue guidance for their adjudicators to recognize the ways in which gender-based claims could meet the refugee definition.

The United States was among the first to respond to the call. In 1995, the Department of Justice issued a document instructing asylum officers to consider the evolving understanding of women’s rights as human rights. The following year, the Board of Immigration Appeals issued a watershed decision , granting asylum to a young woman fleeing genital cutting. The court recognized that claims of gender-based violence could qualify under the “particular social group” category.

Yet the path forward was anything but smooth. In 1999, the same court denied asylum to a Guatemalan woman who endured a decade of brutal beatings and death threats from her husband, while the state refused to intervene. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno found the decision to be so out of step with U.S. policy that she used her authority to vacate it . And so women remained eligible to be considered a “particular social group” when seeking refuge in the U.S. The view was affirmed by a 2014 case recognizing that women fleeing domestic violence could indeed qualify for asylum.

But that progress was short-lived. In 2018, Atty. Gen. Jeff Sessions took jurisdiction over the case of Anabel , a Salvadoran survivor of domestic violence to whom the top U.S. immigration court had granted asylum.

Sessions ruled that domestic violence is an act of personal or private violence, rather than persecution on account of a protected ground. This characterization of the violence as personal or private was in direct repudiation of the principle that women’s rights are human rights, deserving of human rights remedies, such as asylum.

The Biden administration sought to undo the damage. In 2021, Atty. Gen. Merrick Garland vacated that ruling and reinstated the 2014 precedent, restoring a measure of protection for gender claims.

Now comes the recent ruling from the immigration court under the Trump administration. Going beyond Sessions’ determination that gender violence is personal, the court is striking at the heart of the legal framework itself by barring gender or gender-plus-nationality as a valid way to define a social group. This erects an even higher barrier for women and girls fleeing persecution. It is a transparent attempt to roll back decades of legal progress and return us to a time when women’s suffering was invisible in refugee law.

The implications are profound. This ruling will make it far more difficult for women and girls to win asylum, even though their claims often involve some of the most egregious human rights violations. But it does not foreclose all claims — each must still be decided on its own facts — and there is no doubt the precedent will be challenged in federal courts across the country.

Another reversal is now sorely needed, to get the struggle for gender equality moving in the right direction again. Our refugee laws should protect women, because women should not be subject to gender-based violence. That is, in fact, one of our human rights.

456,204,Texas man indicted for fatally shooting Afghan refugee who had helped US troops defuse bombs,https://apnews.com/article/afghan-refugee-fatal-shooting-houston-d10fe7077e39d80ebec2fd9beb016744,2025-08-01T02:46:46Z,The Associated Press,US,refugee,"HOUSTON (AP) — The brother of an Afghan refugee who helped U.S. forces defuse bombs during the war in Afghanistan expressed frustration Thursday that it took more than three months for the Texas man accused of fatally shooting his sibling over a parking dispute to be indicted in the case.

When Abdul Rahman Waziri, 31, was shot while getting his mail at his Houston apartment complex on April 27, police knew who the alleged shooter was as the man had identified himself to officers at the scene, according to authorities. Katia Trevon Bougere, 31, told officers “he and Waziri were arguing over parking,” police said.

“After consulting with the Harris County District Attorney’s Office, the male was released and the investigation continued,” Houston police said in a statement a day after the shooting.

On June 17, police said the case would be referred to a grand jury. Bougere was indicted on Monday on a murder charge. Bougere was not arrested after his murder indictment but issued a summons to appear in court on Aug. 5.

Abdullah Khan, Waziri’s older brother, said he and his family were upset that months had passed without any developments in the case.

“It was heartbreaking … it was really hopeless. I couldn’t imagine if someone is killing someone senselessly. And then the person walking free for months and months. It’s just terrible,” Khan, 36, told The Associated Press during a phone interview.

Waziri and his brother had worked for the Afghan National Mine Reduction Group, a highly trained unit that cleared improvised explosive devices and mines for U.S. Army Special Forces and Afghan commandos.

A group of Green Berets who had worked with the National Mine Reduction Group had sent a letter in May to Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare asking for action in the case. A Change.org petition by the 1208 Foundation that asked for the alleged shooter to be charged has received more than 86,000 signatures. The foundation provides aid to Afghans who worked with U.S. Special Forces to clear explosives.

The Harris County District Attorney’s Office declined to comment on the case.

“As the case is pending, it’s not our office’s policy to discuss facts related to the investigation,” spokesperson Courtney Fischer said in an email.

Court records did not list an attorney for Bougere. He did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

Omar Khawaja, an attorney for Waziri’s family, said Bougere has claimed that he shot Waziri in self-defense.

Waziri “was known as a gentle giant ... not someone who is going to lose his cool over a dispute in a parking lot,” Khawaja said.

Khan said his brother had parked his car in front of the mailboxes at his apartment complex and was getting his mail when he was confronted by Bougere.

A witness who saw the physical confrontation between Waziri and Bougere indicated Waziri was not the aggressor and had raised his hands and told Bougere, “Don’t shoot,” Khan said.

Khan had worked with the National Mine Reduction Group from 2008 until coming to the U.S. in 2020. Waziri worked for the unit from 2016 until U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021.

Khan settled in Tampa, Florida. Waziri lived with his brother before coming to Houston about two years ago. Khan said his brother had planned to return to Tampa with his wife and two daughters after his apartment lease in Houston had ended.

“When he came and we were feeling safe, we were like, ’Oh, thank God. We got out of Afghanistan and no more gunfire, no more bombs.’ But unfortunately for my brother, it happened to him,” Khan said.

457,204,"Lebanon’s UN refugee agency chief hopes at least 200,000 Syrian refugees return under new plan",https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-syria-refugees-un-unhcr-conflict-d4c5847a30c90fd8e51317f4b271f740,2025-07-31T19:54:37Z,The Associated Press,US,refugee,"BEIRUT (AP) — The UN refugee agency’s representative in Lebanon said Thursday he hopes that at least 200,000 Syrian refugees return from Lebanon by the end of the year under a new government-backed return plan.

Before former President Bashar Assad was ousted in a lightning insurgent offensive in December, only about 1% of the Syrian refugees in Lebanon said they were planning to return, UNHCR’s outgoing Lebanon Representative Ivo Freijsen said.

“That has now changed ... 24% of the Syrian refugee community in Lebanon is now thinking or planning about going back during the next 12 months. So that’s a very positive shift,” Freijsen told The Associated Press in an interview.

Syria’s uprising-turned-conflict displaced half of the country’s prewar population of 23 million over the last 14 years. Lebanon hosted an estimated 1.5 million refugees, making up roughly a quarter of Lebanon’s six million people at one point. Officials estimate that at least 1 million refugees are still in the country today.

Scaling up a new return plan

The UNHCR had said for years that Syria was not yet safe for return, despite mounting pressure from Lebanese authorities since the country plunged into an economic crisis in 2019.

That policy has changed since the Assad dynasty’s decades-long autocratic rule came to an end. Many of the refugees in Lebanon had fled because they were political opponents of Assad or to avoid forced conscription into his army.

Freijsen said that the agency was able to confirm at least 120,000 Syrian refugees leaving Lebanon since Assad’s fall without any help from UN groups or charities.

“But we now have this scheme available, and we hope to be able to scale up,” Freijsen said. “Collectively, we have now made it as easy as possible for Syrians to go back to Syria, to their home country.”

Under the plan, the UNHCR and International Organization for Migration will provide $100 for each family member and transportation by bus, while the Lebanese authorities would waive any outstanding fees or fines that they owe for violating residency requirements.

Once they cross the border, the UN agencies will help the returning refugees secure missing documents, offer legal and mental health support, and some aid.

At least 17,000 Syrians have signed up so far, with most opting to take their own vehicles. Freijsen observed a small test run on Tuesday of 72 Syrians leaving by bus through Lebanon’s Masnaa border crossing with Syria. He said about a quarter of surveyed Syrian refugees want to return or plan to do so in the next year, a surge from almost none less than a year ago.

“We have a most ambitious target, objective and hope, of 400,000 (returns) by the end of this year. Again that’s most optimistic,” he said. “But if we get a final figure by the year between 200,000 and 400,000, that would be very positive.”

Syria’s economy still far from recovered

The UN estimates it will cost hundreds of billions of dollars to rebuild Syria and make its economy viable again, when 90% of its population lives in poverty. A new administration led by interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has restored diplomatic ties with Arab Gulf nations and Western nations. U.S. President Donald Trump recently announced that Washington would lift sanctions from Syria, which swiftly paved the way for large business deals with Turkey, Qatar, Saudi Arabia.

But Syria will need to time for its economy to bounce back, and its new authorities are still struggling with exerting their authority across the entire country as they try to reach settlement with opposing groups that have at times led to violent conflict. UN agencies have also faced massive budget cuts which have scaled down the size of their teams and the amount of aid they can give. All that could hamper the sustainability of refugees returning home, Freijsen warned.

“People are prepared to go back with lots of issues and struggle and issues to overcome, provided that they can also earn a living. And that is still difficult,” said Freijsen.

Meanwhile, over 100,000 new Syrian refugees have fled to Lebanon since Assad’s fall, mainly from the Shiite Muslim community fearful of revenge against them by the new Sunni-led authorities.

They were followed by tens of thousands of members of the Alawite religious minority from Syria’s coastal province who fled after an insurgent attack on the new authorities by Assad loyalists turned into dayslong conflict and led to targeted sectarian revenge attacks that killed hundreds of mostly Alawite civilians.

The new refugees have arrived at a time when aid is shrinking for the refugees already present.

“We are most impressed by what local authorities and communities are doing to receive them. And we try to support them,” Freijsen said. “But we think it’s going to take a little bit of time before these people can start to have the confidence to go back, because what they have gone through is quite atrocious.”",GNews,-2.46,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.81,"the associated press, Associated Press, AP, apnews.com, ap, ap news, associated press",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/associated-press-apnews/,https://ground.news/interest/ap,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/associated-press-media-bias,,,,,,,,Left,Cooperatively owned,1846,-3.02,,,Unknown,Unknown,Left,Left,Left,apnews.com,,the associated press,32,USA,,,,

It’s the latest bizarre turn in a case that has sparked protests in Houston and prompted Green Berets to write letters to public officials demanding justice for their fallen former comrade.

“A husband and father was senselessly killed, and while we are grateful the grand jury returned a murder charge, it is outrageous that the man accused of taking his life is being allowed to appear by summons — not arrested, not handcuffed, not treated like the violent offender he is alleged to be.”

Asked why prosecutors didn’t issue an arrest warrant, a spokeswoman for the Harris County district attorney’s office responded with a brief statement.

“After a grand jury indicted the defendant, the clerk’s office issued a summons and he’s required to appear in court,” the statement read.

Efforts to reach Bougere were not successful, and it was not immediately clear if he had hired an attorney.

For five years, Waziri served in an elite unit tasked with helping to protect Green Berets in Afghanistan. He made it to the U.S. in 2021 and settled in Houston with his wife and two young daughters, only to be gunned down outside his apartment complex, Houston police said.

The gunman spoke to police officers at the scene but was let go without being charged, police said. Three months passed with no updates from law enforcement officials. But on Monday, a Houston grand jury returned an indictment charging Bougere with felony murder, according to a copy obtained by NBC News.

The charging documents include a “request for summons” that calls on Bougere to appear in court at 9 a.m. next Tuesday, Aug. 5.

“Failure to appear will result in a warrant being issued for your arrest,” it states.

David Kwok, an associate professor of law at the University of Houston Law Center, said state law allows for prosecutors to request a summons rather than an arrest warrant even for people accused of murder and other violent crimes. But it was unclear to him why the Harris County district attorney’s office would make such a decision in this case.

“It certainly provokes a lot of questions,” he said.

Eddie Cortes, a veteran defense attorney in Houston who has no connection to this case, said it is an unusual course of action but it typically comes down to whether the defendant has hired a lawyer who is known to prosecutors.

""They're not going to do this with somebody who is just Joe Blow off the street,"" said Cortes. ""But they will if the guy has counsel, and he's a well-respected longtime defense attorney here in town.""

Bougere hails from the Los Angeles area, according to online records, and he competed in the high jump at Lynwood High School.

In 2020, he filed paperwork in Texas to launch a company called Black Kartier Militia LLC, according to state records. No other information was immediately available.

The fatal shooting took place on the evening of April 27. Just before 9:10 p.m., Waziri drove into the parking lot of his apartment complex and hopped out of his Toyota Camry, according to surveillance footage provided to NBC News by the family’s attorney.

A man pulled up in a car behind his vehicle, leading to a confrontation that ended with Waziri lying on the ground, with multiple gunshot wounds.

The surveillance footage did not capture the shooting or the moments beforehand, but the other man was seen calmly walking away afterward.

Waziri was unarmed at the time, according to Khawaja, his family’s lawyer.

Houston police said in a statement that responding officers were approached at the scene by a man who identified himself as the shooter and said he and Waziri were “arguing over parking.” Officers interviewed the man and took possession of his gun but then let him go.

The spokeswoman for the district attorney’s office told NBC News in May that prosecutors were waiting for additional information from investigators before deciding whether to bring charges.

Abdullah Khan, Waziri’s brother, said that he was “very happy” with the grand jury’s decision, but that he doesn’t understand why it took so long for the suspect to be charged.

5,210,Judge blocks Trump plan to tie states’ transportation funds to immigration enforcement,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/transportation-funds-immigration-enforcement-trump-lawsuit,2025-06-19T21:51:18Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"A federal judge on Thursday blocked Donald Trump’s administration from forcing 20 Democratic-led states to cooperate with immigration enforcement in order to receive billions of dollars in transportation grant funding.

Chief US District Judge John McConnell in Providence, Rhode Island, granted the states’ request for an injunction barring the Department of Transportation’s policy, saying the states were likely to succeed on the merits of some or all of their claims.

The Trump administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The ruling came in a lawsuit filed by a group of Democratic state attorneys general who argued the administration was seeking to unlawfully hold federal funds hostage to coerce them into adhering to Trump’s hardline immigration agenda.

The states argued the US transportation secretary, Sean Duffy, lacked the authority to impose immigration-enforcement conditions on funding that Congress appropriated to help states sustain roads, highways, bridges and other transportation projects.

Since returning to office on 20 January, Trump has signed several executive orders that have called for cutting off federal funding to so-called sanctuary jurisdictions that do not cooperate with US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) as his administration has moved to conduct mass deportations.

Sanctuary jurisdictions generally have laws and policies that limit or prevent local law enforcement from assisting federal officers with civil immigration arrests.

The justice department has filed a series of lawsuits against such jurisdictions, including Illinois, New York and Colorado, challenging laws in those Democratic-led states that it says hinder federal immigration enforcement.

The lawsuit before McConnell, who was appointed by Barack Obama, was filed after Duffy on 24 April notified states they could lose transportation funding if they do not cooperate with the enforcement of federal law, including with Ice in its efforts to enforce immigration law.

The states argue that policy is improper and amounts to an unconstitutionally ambiguous condition on the states’ ability to receive funding authorized by Congress as it leaves unclear what exactly would constitute adequate cooperation.

The administration has argued the policy was within Duffy’s discretion and that conditions should be upheld as there is nothing improper about requiring states to comply with federal law.

The 20 states are separately pursuing a similar case also in Rhode Island challenging new immigration enforcement conditions that the homeland security department imposed on grant programs.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,Y

Hundreds of teachers marched through downtown L.A. to call on LAUSD to do more to protect students from immigration raids.

DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES (KABC) -- Hundreds of teachers marched through downtown Los Angeles Saturday to call on LAUSD to do more to protect students from immigration raids.

Educators marched a quarter of a mile through downtown to LAUSD headquarters. They chanted ""ICE out of L.A."" and ""immigrants are welcome here.""

The marchers challenged LAUSD to do more to keep students of color and their families safe when it comes to immigration enforcement.

""They have waited outside of our campuses,"" said Maria Miranda, with United Teachers Los Angeles. ""They have tried to enter our schools and they have sought families going to their child's graduation ceremony.""

UTLA, the union representing the teachers, claims the district's safety policies don't go far enough. With less than two weeks until the new school year, students at the rally also raised concerns.

""Fear has spread through our classrooms,"" LAUSD student Vanessa Guerrero told the crowd at the rally. ""Some students are too scared to come to school.""

The group urged the district to prevent federal agents from coming within a two-block radius of any school, provide food and personal supplies and offer virtual learning for immigrant students. They also called on local and state leaders to help bring back deported students.

One teacher at the rally said one of her students was deported after they were taken into ICE custody with their mother during an immigration appointment.

""Instead of preparing for her senior year, she is hiding from persecution in Guatemala,"" the teacher said.

The rally comes just as a federal appeals court upheld a lower court ruling blocking the Trump administration from carrying out indiscriminate immigration arrests.

The school district issued a statement Saturday that reads in part:

They want to “send us back to a world where a U.S. citizen ... can be grabbed, slammed against a fence and have his phone and ID taken from him just because he was working at a tow yard in a Latino neighborhood,” American Civil Liberties Union attorney Mohammad Tajsar told the court Monday.

The federal government argued that it hadn’t been given enough time to collect and present evidence in the lawsuit, given that it was filed shortly before the July 4 holiday and a hearing was held the following week.

“It’s a very serious thing to say that multiple federal government agencies have a policy of violating the Constitution,” attorney Jacob Roth said.

He also argued that the lower court’s order was too broad, and that immigrant advocates did not present enough evidence to prove that the government had an official policy of stopping people without reasonable suspicion.

He referred to the four factors of race, language, presence at a location, and occupation that were listed in the temporary restraining order, saying the court should not be able to ban the government from using them at all. He also argued that the order was unclear on what exactly is permissible under law.

“Legally, I think it’s appropriate to use the factors for reasonable suspicion,” Roth said

The judges sharply questioned the government over their arguments.

“No one has suggested that you cannot consider these factors at all,” Judge Jennifer Sung said.

However, those factors alone only form a “broad profile” and don’t satisfy the reasonable suspicion standard to stop someone, she said.

Sung, a Biden appointee, said that in an area like Los Angeles, where Latinos make up as much as half the population, those factors “cannot possibly weed out those who have undocumented status and those who have documented legal status.”

She also asked: “What is the harm to being told not to do something that you claim you’re already not doing?”

A panel of judges at the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit largely denied a Trump administration request to suspend the lower court ruling, which required federal immigration officials to have reasonable suspicion that someone is in the country illegally before detaining them.

The immigration raids at the center of the legal battle triggered massive protests in the Los Angeles area in June, as well as widespread fears among the region's large Latino community. While most demonstrations were peaceful, instances of violence led President Trump to deploy National Guard troops and U.S. Marines to Los Angeles with orders to protect federal buildings and the immigration agents enforcing his far-reaching crackdown on illegal immigration. Most of them have since been demobilized.

Those high-profile immigration arrests in California have continued, led by Customs and Border Protection agents who have been assigned to help Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers with furthering the Trump administration's mass deportation campaign — in some cases, far away from the U.S.-Mexico border.

Beyond requiring CBP and ICE to have reasonable suspicion before detaining someone, the July order from U.S. District Judge Maame Ewusi-Mensah Frimpong prohibited federal agents from basing arrests on people's race or ethnicity, the fact that they speak Spanish or have an accent, their presence in a location, or their occupation.

Frimpong stated that any immigration arrests that relied exclusively on these factors violated the U.S. Constitution's 4th Amendment, which protects individuals from unreasonable searches and seizures.

""We agree with the district court that, in the context of the Central District of California, the four enumerated factors at issue — apparent race or ethnicity, speaking Spanish or speaking English with an accent, particular location, and type of work, even when considered together — describe only a broad profile and 'do not demonstrate reasonable suspicion for any particular stop,'"" the 9th Circuit panel wrote in its opinion Friday.

The panel was comprised of Circuit Judges Ronald M. Gould, Marsha S. Berzon, and Jennifer Sung, appointees of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Joe Biden.

The cases cited in the lawsuit against the Los Angeles-area immigration sweeps involved arrests in June near a car wash, a tow yard and other locations where U.S. citizens were among those questioned about their legal status and detained by federal agents. Advocates have described the operations as ""roving patrols.""

The 9th Circuit did alter one part of Frimpong's ruling, removing an exception to her ban on using the four factors that include people's race and vocation when making arrests. The panel said that an ""except as permitted by law"" clause in her order was too vague.

Pro-immigrant advocates hailed Friday's ruling, denouncing the Trump administration's immigration sweeps as indiscriminate raids that have instilled fear in the Los Angeles area.

""Every person, regardless of immigration status, has the right to live, work, and belong in their community without being hunted, harassed, or locked away,"" said Lindsay Toczylowski, president of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, a Los Angeles-based group that represents those facing deportation.

The Trump administration has maintained in court that federal officials rely on intelligence packages and certain information — like ""past experiences"" that immigrants living in the U.S. illegally frequent or work at certain locations — when carrying out immigration enforcement operations.

In a statement to CBS News on Saturday, Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said that ""unelected judges are undermining the will of the American people.""

""What makes someone a target of ICE is if they are illegally in the U.S.—NOT their skin color, race, or ethnicity,"" she said. ""America's brave men and women are removing murderers, MS-13 gang members, pedophiles, rapists—truly the worst of the worst from Golden State communities. 70% of ICE arrests are of criminal illegal aliens who have been convicted or have pending charges.

466,210,Inside the neighborhood patrols watching for Ice: ‘They thought they could scare us – but this is LA’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/03/los-angeles-ice-patrols-union-del-barrio-immigration,2025-08-03T12:00:40Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"Dawn broke on a foggy morning on Terminal Island, an artificial slice of land that rests where the city of Los Angeles meets the Pacific Ocean. Sea lions barked in the distance as sleek, white SUVs drove through a checkpoint into a federal prison. Chavo Romero, his hair pulled back in a ponytail, sipped coffee as he watched them.

He awoke before daybreak, taking the day off from his public health job to drive here in the dark. Romero is part of a coalition of trained volunteers called Union del Barrio, who patrol the barrios, or neighbourhoods, to look for immigration enforcement, “La Migra.” When they spot Ice activity, they post videos that go viral, alerting people to seek shelter.

Since June, Union del Barrio volunteers have been patrolling Terminal Island, where they say federal immigration agents have been staging enforcement operations. Agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice), Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and other agencies arrive here early in the morning, Romero said, before being dispatched to conduct raids across southern California. “They’re clocking in to go kidnap people. They see us, they flip us off.”

By arriving early at Terminal Island, the volunteers have a strong vantage point to alert their larger network about which vehicles are leaving the staging area – sending photos that show the make, model, color and plate number. This enables immigrant communities to be on the look out for these vehicles. For instance, Romero said they have seen the same large white van on Terminal Island that was also involved in a violent raid at a cannabis farm in Ventura county. More than 200 people were arrested and one man died.

The patrol’s work is personal for Romero, who is from the farming community of Oxnard in Ventura county. His parents are fieldworkers who are Indigenous to Mexico – his dad is Tepehuan and his mom is Guachichil. Romero, who wore an army green Union del Barrio t-shirt on this July morning, joined the group 30 years ago.

The Los Angeles patrols date back to 1992, after the riots that erupted when officers were acquitted of brutally beating Rodney King, and in recent months they have emerged as a beacon of resistance as California becomes a frontline for raids against immigrant communities. The mass arrests reached a violent crescendo in June, when agents in military-style clothing grabbed people with brown skin off the streets of Los Angeles, dragging them into vans and locking them in detention facilities.

On 11 July, a judge issued a temporary restraining order restricting agents from arresting people based on race or occupation anywhere in the Central District of California, a federal court that serves over 19 million people in southern and central California. The order slowed arrests in Los Angeles, but didn’t stop them. And immigration enforcement received a windfall this month of $75bn from Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, noted Romero.

“We’re tripling down on our patrols,” he said. “The whole order was to end racial profiling … But the restraining order doesn’t say stop the deportation and detention.”

“That will never stop,” he added. “It’s a multi-billion dollar industry that needs to keep going.”

‘The city is under siege’

Life for immigrants in the US has become more precarious since Donald Trump took office and declared an emergency at the US-Mexico border, paving the way for raids in the 100-mile border zone, including Los Angeles. But few were prepared for just how dire things have become.

In June, federal agents wearing mirrored glasses and ski masks swept through Home Depots, car washes and street vendor stands. They approached people with brown skin in the barrios, demanding to see IDs and asking where they’re from. They tackled people and dragged them into unmarked vans. According to a lawsuit filed by the ACLU, agents typically had no warrants or prior information about the people they arrested – they approached them based on skin color or occupation.

Keli Reynolds, a Los Angeles immigration attorney and founding partner of Olmos & Reynolds, has worked immigration cases under five administrations stretching back to George W Bush. “I’ve never seen it like this, and I’ve been practicing for 20 years,” she said. “The city is under siege. People are terrified.” She noted that none of her clients who were detained since the siege began in June had criminal records.

“They were detaining people, tackling them, and there was absolutely no reasonable suspicion,” she said. “They were sweeping areas and detaining, I would say, almost 100% Latinos, anybody with brown skin.”

In her 11 July order, the judge agreed with the ACLU that there was “a mountain of evidence” to support the allegations. But she acknowledged that the federal government is allowed to carry out large-scale immigration enforcement in Los Angeles. The order essentially tells Ice to follow the constitution, Reynolds said.

The White House denies that agents have targeted people based on skin color. On 18 July, in response to a reporter’s question, Kristi Noem, the Homeland Security secretary called it a “false narrative that has been put out there in the media”. She scolded the reporter: “Don’t you dare ever say that again.”

Ice agents appear to have shifted their strategy since the order, Reynolds said. They are now picking people up outside their homes while claiming to have warrants, whether or not they actually produce one.

Renyolds said in one case in LA County, her client was detained by agents who did not identify themselves. “They told her they had a warrant but they didn’t show her a warrant. And she even asked to see a warrant, and they said they didn’t have to show it to her,” she said.

In another incident reported by LA Taco, agents tried to arrest a woman at her Huntington Park home, but the community confronted them and demanded a warrant.

Federal agents continue to target Home Depots, but now it’s happening outside of the Central District, Romero said. On 22 July, Union del Barrio posted a video showing Ice agents detaining two workers at a Home Depot in Encinitas, outside of the zone protected by the order.

‘We’re not backing down’

Los Angeles has not returned to normal. The barrios remain cautiously quiet. Street vendors have returned to the sidewalks, although in smaller numbers. People check social media for Ice activity before running errands.

“We’re treating it like a cease fire,” said Ron Gochez, founder of Union del Barrio’s Los Angeles chapter. “During a cease fire, you have to regroup your forces, because you know it’s going to start again.”

The group’s patrols are a model for the larger Community Self-Defense Coalition, which holds training sessions to teach people to document Ice activity. Union del Barrio is using this time to train more volunteers. Gochez estimated they have trained 750 people since the court order.

Gochez is skeptical that the Trump administration, which has routinely defied the courts, will continue respecting the order. “We don’t anticipate the Trump administration respecting this if it doesn’t go his way,” Gochez said. “What we anticipate is three and a half more years of repression against us.”

The raids are part of a 500-year anti-colonial struggle, Gochez said. “We know we’re going to take losses, but in the end, we’re going to win.”

Back on Terminal Island at around 7.30am, a black four-by-four truck with a federal plate pulled up and a man stepped out, watching the volunteers. Romero believed they were being surveilled.

In June, Union del Barrio found itself in the crosshairs of the administration. Josh Hawley, a Trump ally and chair of the Senate subcommittee on crime and counterterrorism, sent a letter accusing them of “aiding and abetting criminal conduct” and providing “logistical and financial resources” in relation to the resistance protests. Union del Barrio rejected the allegations, noting that protesters were responding to “a rapidly growing number of intentionally cruel, increasingly violent, militarized immigration operations across the United States”.

“They were asking us to voluntarily cease and desist,” said Romero. “We were like: ‘We’re going to voluntarily tell you no.’”

As he spoke, Romero was interrupted by the thrumming of an LAPD helicopter overhead – a familiar sound in the Los Angeles barrios. It flew over the group several times.

Romero views the city as a frontline. “Los Angeles is the most heavily populated urban center of Mexicans north of the border,” he said. “If they’re able to crush the LA resistance, that means they’re going to be able to do it anywhere else. That’s why LA as a frontline has been a critical space to show that the community is organized, and we’re not backing down.”

He feels proud of the city for providing an example of how communities across the country can resist raids. “They really thought they were going to come in and scare everyone into their corners, but this is LA — and LA is resisting.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
467,210,Trump has militarized the immigration system. Now is the time to stand up,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/aug/03/trump-us-immigration,2025-08-03T11:00:39Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"On the Fourth of July, President Trump signed his sweeping signature domestic policy bill into law. He called it “beautiful”. I would call it a grave and existential threat to our already precarious democracy.

Perhaps the biggest headline to emerge from this bill is that it tears giant holes into our social safety net to ensure our nation’s wealthiest could benefit from additional tax breaks. But for those of us on the frontlines of the fight to protect immigrants’ rights, it signaled the further entrenchment of an authoritarian regime being created on the backs of immigrants. Irrespective of our immigration status or views on immigration, we should all be concerned because we will all be affected: the sheer quantity of resources set aside for immigration enforcement will turbocharge the militarization of our country.

History has taught us that social justice movements can play a significant role in protecting democracies when they are at risk from authoritarian regimes. This bill should be a wakeup call for us all to step up in defense of our democracy before it is too late. Here is what we should anticipate.

The law hands over a staggering $170bn to the Department of Homeland Security to ramp up this administration’s brutal immigration enforcement agenda. Among the direct beneficiaries of this largesse is Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice).

Even without these resources, Ice has already been responsible for outrageous and unconstitutional acts that are hacking away at our democracy. It is Ice agents in masks who are kidnapping our neighbors, snatching them off the streets, at courthouses or their workplaces, shoving them into SUVs, and taking them to detention centers. Many have been deported without even being given the right to go before a judge.

Ice agents are using unimaginably harsh tactics. They are violently smashing car windows, ripping parents away from their kids, and targeting children at school. The audacity of their lawlessness and cruelty – often on public display – is unprecedented.

The Trump administration has shown a willingness to crack down violently on those who speak out against its immigration policies. Even public officials have been caught in this dragnet, including California senator Alex Padilla, New Jersey congresswoman LaMonica McIver, Newark mayor Ras Baraka, and New York City mayoral candidate Brad Lander. Every one of these violent encounters has been caught on film.

With this new and massive infusion of resources now being handed over to the DHS and Ice, we will soon see many more abductions on our streets, more family separations, and more brutal crackdowns on dissenters. We are also likely to see the widespread militarization of our communities, consistent with what has already transpired in parts of California: heavily armed military officers in battle fatigues carrying out violent raids with the use of tear gas and rubber bullets; the storming of public venues such as MacArthur Park in Los Angeles for no reason other than to instill fear and intimidation; and government-sanctioned attempts to silence and intimidate public officials and activists through arrests, violence, criminal sanctions and prosecutions.

As scenes previewed by militarized Los Angeles become commonplace in cities across the country – in blue states, to make an example, and in red states eager to collude – many more Americans will perhaps come to realize the full impact of this bill and recognize that the same system that cages immigrants closes rural hospitals. The same ideology that justifies family separation does not flinch when taking away food from the hungry. A government that disappears immigrants to foreign torture prisons without a day in court cannot be trusted to uphold your rights either. The machine of state violence, once built, expands.

So, what are we to do? How do we move forward?

It is incumbent on all of us to double down and meet the moment with the urgency it demands. That means committing to doing what we can to protect the most vulnerable amongst us and hold public officials accountable. We must be loud in our opposition to the attacks on our democracy and actively exercise our freedoms to protect it. We must contact our members of Congress to demand that they uphold the rule of law and take on those actively working to undermine our system of checks and balances. We must join the protests and the growing movement of people from all walks of life who are actively fighting authoritarianism. We must do everything we can to support our immigrant friends, neighbors and community members whose lives are being torn apart by this administration.

Finally, we must also vigorously reject the paralyzing lure of fatalism – that the future will merely be an extension of our present rather than something we can build together. If our government can pour boundless resources into hurting people, there is nothing radical or unrealistic in insisting that those same resources could be used to better all of our lives.

At the National Immigration Law Center, we will continue using every tool at our disposal to fight back against Trump’s attacks on our communities. We are clear eyed about how we got here and what the stakes are. Just because this moment demands defense, it will not stop us from standing firm in the declaration that a pathway to a better world still exists.

What’s giving me hope now

What’s giving me hope now is the number of people who are joining a rapidly growing movement fighting back against this administration’s authoritarian plans. They include courageous immigrants who refuse to be silenced or dehumanized; retirees who are spending time being of service to impacted immigrants, engaging elected officials and/or attending rallies and town halls; courageous young people who refuse to accept the status quo and are putting their bodies on the line; and entire communities who are speaking out and doing everything possible to protect their neighbors.

All of us have a role in upholding justice and preserving our democracy. I’m heartened to see people from all walks of life determined to do their part and remain optimistic that this movement will get bigger and stronger over time.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

It comes following a report that two men charged in connection with the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl are Afghan migrants.

Ahmad Mulakhil, aged 23, has been accused of rape. Mohammad Kabir, aged 23, has been accused of kidnap, strangulation and aiding and abetting rape of a girl under 13.

Both have appeared in court in connection with the alleged incident in the Cheveral Street area on Tuesday, July 22 and are now due to appear at crown court on August 26. The registered addresses of the duo are in Nuneaton.

The Warwickshire Police statement reads in full: ""There's been some questions about what we do and don't release as part of a high-profile investigation such as this.

""Following the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Nuneaton on Tuesday 22 July we started an immediate and fast-moving investigation.

""This provided specialist support for the victim and involves detectives, neighbourhood teams and experts from across the force.

""The impact of such a crime is felt across the community, of which we are a part.

""Our neighbourhood officers work every day with local community partners.

""When something significant happens, we brief these partners and local elected officials on the circumstances of the crime, the investigation, the work being undertaken to arrest those responsible and how local people and partners can help a concerned community.

""Where relevant, sensitive information around locations, details of the crime and policing activity to catch offenders can be shared, with a warning that this is sensitive or confidential information and disclosure by those being briefed could affect future court hearings.

""We work to hold offenders to account and will always do everything in our power to present a robust case to the courts and protect the integrity of court proceedings.

""Once someone is charged with an offence, we follow national guidance. This guidance does not include sharing ethnicity or immigration status.

""As our investigation progresses, the victim remains at the forefront of our focus, and we will continue to work with our partners – providing updates and working alongside the people of Nuneaton.""",GNews,,,not found,,,,"coventry telegraph, Coventry Telegraph, coventrytelegraph.net, coventry live, coventrylive",not found,,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,coventrytelegraph.net,,coventry telegraph,248,UK,,,,

A protest against the use of a hotel to accommodate asylum seekers has begun, with rival groups of protesters separated by police. The Metropolitan Police has imposed conditions on a protest and counter-protest outside the Thistle City Barbican Hotel in Islington, north London.

People believed to be migrants watched from open windows inside the hotel as protesters chanted and banged drums in the street below on Saturday afternoon. Some waved and blew kisses at protesters in the street below.

A man wearing an England football shirt was detained by police after getting into an angry confrontation with officers. A protest and counter-protest will also take place in Newcastle outside The New Bridge Hotel on Saturday.

The Metropolitan Police said the protest against the use of the Islington hotel was organised by local residents under the banner “Thistle Barbican needs to go – locals say no”. A counter-protest, organised by Stand Up To Racism and supported by former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, as well as other groups including Finsbury Park Mosque and Islington Labour Party, is also taking place.

Police said the anti-asylum hotel protest had been “endorsed by groups from outside the local community, which is likely to increase the number of people attending”. Online groups that have voiced support for the protest include “Patriots of Britain” and “Together for the Children”. A student counter-protester outside the Thistle City Barbican Hotel said he wants migrants to “feel safe” in the UK.

Pat Prendergast, 21, said: “I want people to feel safe. I think the (rival protesters) over there are making people feel unsafe. I want to stand up in solidarity and say that, you know, we want people here. We want migrants. We want asylum seekers.”

A noticeably smaller group of protesters waved union flags and held banners outside the hotel. “Get these scum off our streets”, one man chanted in the direction of the hotel.

A large group of masked protesters dressed in black chanting “we are anti-fascist” appeared from a side street and marched towards the rival group outside the hotel. There were brief clashes before police rushed in to separate the two groups.

The Metropolitan Police said plans were in place to “respond to any protest activity in the vicinity of other hotels in London being used to accommodate asylum seekers”. Conditions on the anti-asylum hotel protest include that anyone participating must remain within King Charles Square and that the assembly must not begin before 1pm and must conclude by 4pm. Police said conditions on the counter-protest include that participants must remain in Lever Street, near the junction with Central Street, and that the assembly must not begin before 12pm and must conclude by 4pm.

Chief Superintendent Clair Haynes, in charge of the policing operation, said: “We have been in discussions with the organisers of both protests in recent days, building on the ongoing engagement between local officers, community groups and partners.

“We understand that there are strongly held views on all sides. Our officers will police without fear or favour, ensuring those exercising their right to protest can do so safely, but intervening at the first sign of actions that cross the line into criminality.

“We have used our powers under the Public Order Act to put conditions in place to prevent serious disorder and to minimise serious disruption to the lives of people and businesses in the local community.

“Those conditions identify two distinct protest areas where the protests must take place, meaning the groups will be separated but still within sight and sound of each other.”

There are also posts online advertising a “for our children, for our future” protest in Newcastle on Saturday outside The New Bridge Hotel. A “stop the far right and fascists in Newcastle” counter-protest has been organised by Stand Up To Racism at the nearby Laing Art Gallery.

In a statement, the organisers of the counter protest said: “Yet again far-right and fascist thugs are intent on bringing their message of hate to Newcastle. They aim to build on years of Islamophobia, anti-migrant sentiment and scapegoating.

“In Epping and elsewhere recently we have already seen intimidation and violence aimed at refugees, migrants and asylum seekers. Newcastle, like the rest of the North East, has a well-earned reputation for unity in the face of those who seek to divide us. Whatever problems we face, racism and division are not the answer.”

Northumbria Police have been approached for comment. Meanwhile, about 100 people attended a protest outside the Stanwell Hotel in Spelthorne, Surrey, on Friday evening, during which a packet of lit firelighters was thrown at police, Surrey Police said.

472,210,Language on immigration in UK news and politics found to have ‘shaped backlash against antiracism’,https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/aug/02/language-on-immigration-in-uk-news-and-politics-found-to-have-shaped-backlash-against-antiracism,2025-08-02T07:00:05Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"A pattern of “hostile language” in news reports and UK parliamentary debates is more likely to describe people of colour as immigrants, or with less sympathy, researchers have found.

The race equality thinktank the Runnymede Trust analysed more than 63m words from 52,990 news articles and 317 House of Commons debates on immigration between 2019 and the general election in July 2024.

Researchers concluded that the use of language about race and immigration by media and politicians has helped shape “the increase in reactionary politics and backlash against antiracism which has emboldened the far right in this country”.

The report, A Hostile Environment: Language, Race, Surveillance and the Media is the second in a series. The first phase of the research analysed parliamentary and media reports from 2010 to 2014. It found that “illegal” was the most commonly linked word to migrants in parliamentary debates, which the researchers said reinforced the perception of migration as inherently unlawful.

The latest report found that between 2019 and 2024 “the word ‘illegal’ has became an even stronger word association with the terms ‘migrant’ and ‘immigrant’ in both news and parliamentary debates than it was in the 2010–14 period”, which, the authors claim, “shows that the defining characteristic of migrants has been cemented as illegality over the past decade”.

The study claims that since 2014, “hostile environment” immigration policies have worked to “expand and normalise the surveillance state” through legislation, reporting measures and data sharing.

When the researchers filtered “words associated with immigrants” in news data by nationality, religion, ethnicity and geographical location, they found the word “Mexican” was most strongly associated, “typically in the context of news reports about the USA”.

Referring to the second- and third-placed terms in that category, the report added that “Chinese” and “Indian” were also very strongly associated with “immigrant(s)”, usually when reporting about immigration “in the UK context”.

The other most commonly used signifiers of identity associated with the word “immigrants” in news were “Asian”, “Irish”, “Haitian”, “Muslim”, “Jewish”, “non-white”, “Venezuelan”, “Cuban” and “African”.

“Overwhelmingly, when the UK news media represents immigrants, the image that is invoked … is of an ethnically minoritised person,” the report added.

Meanwhile, in Hansard data of parliamentary debates, the top 10 words most strongly associated with migration were “illegal”, “net”, “committee”, “act”, “bill”, “tackle”, “level”, “reduce”, “system,” and “mass”.

The report said parliamentarians “are more likely to use humanising terms when talking about Ukrainians” – such as “guest”, “brave”, “community” or “diaspora”.

The report claims: “Racist discourse from the highest levels of UK society, including politicians and the media, is used to frame immigration as an existential threat to the British way of life … this works to justify ever more hostile immigration policies.”

The report added: “One stark example of the partnership between parliament and the news media in framing public perceptions of immigration in the UK can be found in connection with the ‘stop the boats’ political slogan.

“The explicit use of this slogan by rioters in the summer of 2024 on banners and in chants demonstrates that the hostile language we have identified in our analysis has emboldened sectors of the UK public to engage in racist violence.

“Throughout the 2019-24 period, news articles and political debates disseminating this kind of narrative come out in fairly close alignment with each other, both reaching their peak in 2023 and declining slightly into 2024, but with still very high levels of usage.”

The Home Office has been approached for comment.

The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said the disorder of August 2024 – which followed the Southport attack – ‘“highlighted the need for a new approach to community cohesion” and that a task force was developing a strategic national approach, while £1.5bn was being invested in community services in 75 areas nationwide.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

One year ago, as the riots that started in Southport spread across the country, people in the old coalfields started to join in the action. In Wath upon Dearne, a former pit area in the metropolitan borough of Rotherham, rioters clashed with police outside a Holiday Inn Express, leading to some of the most appalling violence of that summer. The hotel’s residents, housed there by the Home Office while it processed their asylum claims, said they felt a deep terror when they saw the mob set bins alight and storm the building. It was the event that produced some of the most memorable images of the riots. For all the distinct 2020s character of the livestreamed disturbances, the clashes invoked the past too. Not only was the hotel built on former colliery land, but to some former miners, the violence was reminiscent of the battle between police and picketers at nearby Orgreave 40 years earlier. Back then, protesters also claimed to be defending their way of life, though from deindustrialisation rather than immigration.

Britain’s former coalfields have become deeply disenchanted with politics. When I conducted ethnographic research in mining areas in Nottinghamshire back in 2021 and 2022, long before the events at Southport and beyond, people predicted social unrest. Millie, a care worker and mother of four, told me then that she was done with mainstream politics. “Don’t like Labour much, don’t like the Tories at all. They come in, ‘You will do as we say.’ Don’t have much of a chance of standing up to them.” In her view, the media was complicit and ordinary people were kept in the dark. She told me: “I’ve been predicting there will be riots soon.”

On recent returns to Mansfield and its surrounding villages, the prospect of further rioting has become more urgent. Keir Starmer and Angela Rayner have also spoken of the risk of renewed unrest. Only last month protesters from north Nottinghamshire mining communities marched against asylum hotels, spurred on by the comments of local Reform MP Lee Anderson about an ongoing rape trial. Some locals are animated principally by anger at immigration. In their apocalyptic visions, they are defending not just women and girls but their whiteness, too. For others, however, these concerns are secondary to a wider sense of political voicelessness and apathy in national decline. Millie was among this latter group, which feels that politicians had done nothing and that all they did was tell lies. I asked her why that was. “Money,” Millie said. “It’s always money. Money and greed. You’re not telling me they’re not having their pockets lined.”

Millie’s anger was driven by the loss of sports facilities, the disappearance of the Sure Start centres, and the loss of the shared spaces she held dear. Everything had been “taken away”. Even simple activities such as a family cinema trip or roller-skating at one of the few remaining leisure centres set her back more than she could afford. She would love to be able to drop her kids off to play with the pit band, as her father, a miner, had done with her. But the facilities had shut. “When the pits started closing, they lost funding and stuff. I mean, it’s still about, don’t get me wrong. But it’s not as rife as it used to be… My kids don’t understand it because they never had it. But it hurts me, because what am I to do?”

To understand the anger of the mining towns, we need to understand the history of miners’ welfare. This takes us back to Southport, long before Southport became a shorthand in the national press for the disaffected working class. The Victorian seaside resort was the preferred location for conferences of the northern working class. Its train station was easily reached from Liverpool and Manchester and grand hotels sprang up to host them. (One of these was the ornate red-brick structure of the Scarisbrick Hotel, which would much later be used as an asylum hotel for several months.) Late-19th-century accounts in regional newspapers describe a remarkable sight at one of the conferences: in the early hours of the morning, the sky above the town came alive as the miners – many of whom flew pigeons for a hobby – released their birds to fly back home, while the miners themselves remained in Southport to vote on proposals for the eight-hour working day.

After the First World War, the miners met at Southport again to discuss their demands, having paused strike activity for the duration of the fighting. They wanted to be put in charge of the industry – nationalisation under worker control, as well as wage increases and a reduction in the working day. They threatened to go on strike. The government baulked at their demands, but the ensuing Sankey commission did recommend that colliery owners be charged one penny per tonne of coal, to be put towards social, cultural and medical amenities. This was promptly made law in the Welfare Fund clause of the 1920 Mining Industry Act – the clause from which welfares derive their name.

Sports pitches, pithead baths and social clubs sprang up around Britain’s collieries, all funded by the levy, and, after nationalisation, by the state. The welfares and other amenities were not just useful for community well-being, but also helped to forge a social tie between representatives and the represented. Bolstered by social investment, MPs could prove they cared about the communities that had elected them. In reality, the Welfare Fund investment reflected the structural power of miners over the energy source upon which industry and households depended. Nonetheless, people use the provision as an example of care and recognition. When these were lost in the ravages of deindustrialisation and austerity, it was felt like a moral injury. Politicians still claim to care, but what have their constituents got to show for it?

Quantitative research by the economic geography professors Maria Abreu and Calvin Jones has shown that former coal-mining areas have lower levels of political participation, a lack of political trust and a low sense of political efficacy even compared with economically and demographically similar places. Other recent research tells us that closures of GP practices, pubs and shops are all associated with elevated support for the far right. These losses of social infrastructure are all the more impactful in former mining areas because there was more to lose. The decay of amenities won by the labour movement have become a potent symbol of decline. Today, ex-miners who were once connected to hundreds of others through a dense web of social provision tell me they live increasingly private lives in their private homes. Some end up on dubious Facebook pages and YouTube channels. They come to imagine their homes as embattled fortresses, under siege from disorder and diversity outside.

The Wath Main Colliery memorial in South Yorkshire is a ten-minute walk from the Holiday Inn where everything kicked off in August 2024. Fifteen minutes’ walk the other way there’s a large distribution centre, which regeneration officials had hoped would provide an employment alternative. It is often said that places like Mansfield or Wath were forgotten or left behind, and many of us are guilty of talking about ex-industrial areas as though time stopped shortly after the miners’ strike. Nothing could be further from the truth. In Wath, like in Mansfield, there have been frantic policy interventions to lure footloose businesses and make the land productive again. As a result, many former pit areas have similar landscapes: a big Tesco, expensive newbuild housing and a waste incineration plant – if planners can get it past the local residents.

Like Nottinghamshire, Wath ended up with distribution centres. Here, it is the clothing retailer Next; in Nottinghamshire it’s Amazon and Sports Direct. In Wath, as in the South Wales valleys, they received call centres too. And of course, where land, rent and rates are cheap, the government will soon see an opportunity to make savings. There is never any money to keep Sure Start going or to keep the welfare alive, but people who depend on the state can be dealt with on the cheap. It is, perhaps, easier for Serco and other government contractors to house asylums seekers in one place, rather than disperse smaller groups more widely. To the surprise of no one, this is not a recipe for social cohesion. Racism and xenophobia exist everywhere, but combined with structural decline they make for a particularly toxic politics, and it is not hard to see how far-right visions of civil disorder and societal breakdown could meld with more mundane concerns and a widely shared anti-politics.

In a new report for IPPR, I make the case for the return of a miners’ welfare fund to combat declinism and alienation. Where it was once levied on colliery owners, it should now raise its budget from the large online businesses, such as Amazon, that have filled post-industrial Britain with gargantuan distribution centres. Private-sector-led approaches to regeneration have left mining communities with exploitative jobs and crumbling social infrastructures. Things seem only ever to get worse. Instead, the state could use a 21st-century welfare fund to revive community centres, facilitate affordable family activities and help community groups take neglected spaces into common ownership, reclaiming the mundane utopia of the sports pitch and the pit band. Memories of the affordances of the previous generation of welfare facilities speak to its understated pleasures. “Pit bands – you really got a feel for the pit community,” Millie told me. “Stuck together, had a laugh.”

474,210,US appeals court indicates it might declare Trump’s birthright citizenship order unconstitutional,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/judge-trump-birthright-citizenship-unconstitutional,2025-08-01T22:00:08Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"Donald Trump’s order restricting birthright citizenship appeared on Friday to be headed toward being declared unconstitutional by a second federal appeals court, as judges expressed deep skepticism about a key piece of the US president’s hardline immigration agenda.

A three-judge panel of the Boston-based first US circuit court of appeals sharply questioned a lawyer with the federal justice department as to why they should overturn two lower-court judges who blocked the order from taking effect.

Those lower-court judges include one in Boston who last week reaffirmed his prior decision to block the order’s enforcement nationally, even after the US supreme court in June curbed the power of judges to broadly enjoin that and other policies.

The San Francisco-based ninth US circuit court of appeals last week became the first federal appeals court to hold Trump’s order as unconstitutional. Its ultimate fate will probably be determined by the supreme court.

Eric McArthur, a justice department attorney, said on Friday that the citizenship clause of the US constitution’s 14th amendment, which was ratified in 1868 after the US civil war, rightly extended citizenship to the children of newly freed enslaved Black people.

“It did not extend birthright citizenship as a matter of constitutional right” to the children of people in the US without documentation, he said.

But the judges questioned how that argument was consistent with the supreme court’s 1898 ruling interpreting the clause in United States v Wong Kim Ark, long understood as guaranteeing American citizenship to children born in the US to non-citizen parents.

“We have an opinion by the supreme court that we aren’t free to disregard,” said David Barron, the chief US circuit judge who like his two colleagues was appointed by a Democratic president.

Trump’s executive order, issued on the Republican’s first day back in the Oval Office on 20 January, directs agencies to refuse to recognize the citizenship of US-born children who do not have at least one parent who is a US citizen or lawful permanent resident, also known as a “green card” holder.

Every court to consider the order’s merits has declared it unconstitutional, including the three judges who halted the order’s enforcement nationally. Those judges included Leo Sorokin, a US district judge in Boston, who ruled in favor of 18 Democratic-led states and the District of Columbia, who had swiftly challenged Trump’s policy in court.

“The supreme court has repeatedly recognized children born to individuals who are here unlawfully or who are here on a temporary basis are nonetheless birthright citizens,” Shankar Duraiswamy, a lawyer for New Jersey, argued on Friday.

The 6-3 conservative majority US supreme court on 27 June sided with the administration in the litigation by restricting the ability of judges to issue so-called universal injunctions and directing lower courts that had blocked Trump’s policy nationally to reconsider the scope of their orders.

But the ruling contained exceptions, allowing federal judges in Massachusetts and New Hampshire and the ninth circuit to issue new decisions stopping Trump’s order from taking effect nationally.

The rulings on appeal to the first circuit were issued by Sorokin and the New Hampshire judge, who originally issued a narrow injunction but more recently issued a new decision in a recently filed class action blocking Trump’s order nationwide.

Separately, in an immigration-related ruling on Friday, US district Judge Jia Cobb in Washington DC blocked the Trump administration from fast-tracking the deportation of potentially hundreds of thousands of immigrants who were paroled into the country under humanitarian programs during Joe Biden’s presidency.

Cobb said it served the public interest to put on hold the Department of Homeland Security’s expedited removals for those who entered with temporary parole rather than cause irreparable harm to immigrants by allowing them.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
9,210,Ice is cracking down on Trump’s own supporters. Will they change their minds? | Tayo Bero,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/19/ice-trump-supporters-crackdown,2025-06-19T14:00:09Z,The Guardian,GB,immigration,"By now, the cycle of Donald Trump supporters being slapped in the face by his policies is common enough that it shouldn’t warrant a response. What is noteworthy is the fact that his crusade of mass deportations seems to have taken the Maga crowd by surprise in a way that makes little sense if you’ve been paying attention to Trump, his campaign promises, his party and the people he surrounds himself with.

Even as they witness friends and family members hurt by this administration’s immigration clampdowns, some Trump supporters appear resistant to doing a full 180.

Bradley Bartell, whose wife, Camila Muñoz, was recently detained, says he has no regrets about voting for Trump. Muñoz is from Peru and overstayed a work-study visa that expired right when Covid hit. She was trying to get permanent residency in the US when she was detained.

“I don’t regret the vote,” Bartell told Newsweek. His rationale? Trump is a victim of a bad immigration system that his administration inherited. “He didn’t create the system but he does have an opportunity to improve it. Hopefully, all this attention will bring to light how broken it is.”

For Jensy Machado from Manassas, Virginia, things are a bit more complex. Machado, a naturalized US citizen, was driving to work when, according to NBC 4, he was stopped by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) agents, who brandished guns and surrounded his truck. According to Machado, a man facing a deportation order had given Machado’s home address as his, and when Machado assured agents that they had the wrong person and offered them his Virginia driver’s license, they ordered him to leave his car and handcuffed him.

“I was a Trump supporter,” Machado, who is Hispanic, said. “I voted for Trump last election, but, because I thought it was going to be like … against criminals, not every Hispanic, Spanish-lookalike.

“They will assume that we are all illegals,” he continued. “They’re just following Hispanic people.”

Machado said his support for the administration had been shaken. Others have been rattled by how and where Trump’s policies are being applied.

That dissonance is well articulated in a recent New York Times piece about a small Missouri town that supported Trump – and is now grappling with the effects of his decisions.

Many residents of Kennett, Missouri, were stunned when a beloved neighbor, Carol, was arrested and jailed to await deportation after being summoned to Ice offices in St Louis in April. According to the government, Carol came to the US from Hong Kong in 2004, and has spent the past two decades trying to secure legal stay in the country, ultimately being granted a temporary permission to stay known as an order of supervision. Carol’s most recent order of supervision was supposed to be valid through August 2025, but on the day of her arrest, she was told it was being terminated.

Now, despite the fact that she’s spent the last two decades building a life and community in this small town, getting married and buying a house, she’s spent weeks moving between jails as she awaits a final decision on her deportation.

“I voted for Donald Trump, and so did practically everyone here,” said Vanessa Cowart, who knows Carol from church. “But no one voted to deport moms. We were all under the impression we were just getting rid of the gangs, the people who came here in droves … This is Carol.”

That last line – and the Kennett story as a whole – reveals a deeply American way of thinking about law and order and civil liberties: that anything is fair game once someone is considered a “criminal”. It’s an idea that has been sent into overdrive in the Trump years, where “criminal” has become a catch-all for the most evil, dangerous and undesirable in our communities, and shorthand for referencing anyone society doesn’t want to deal with.

Trump ran on a campaign of hate, and the voters who helped cement that hatred and codify it into policy are now encountering the kind of state-sanctioned violence they endorsed at the ballot box.

Still, to say “I told you so” in a moment like this is not only useless, it feels like a cruel understatement when the thing you were warning about is so destructive.

So what can we learn from this? US leadership is clearly invested in the destruction of vulnerable American lives. If people who have been directly affected by Trump’s behaviour still find reasons to rationalize his leadership, it’s a reminder that ousting this regime will require the rest of us to speak out against tyranny and the establishment politics that got us here in the first place.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,Y
476,82,"For the first time in decades, U.S. could see negative net migration threatening labor force, GDP growth",https://fortune.com/2025/07/15/trump-mass-deportation-impact-labor-force-gdp-growth-shrinkage/,2025-07-15T04:00:00Z,Fortune,US,mass migration,"President Donald Trump’s efforts to deport millions of immigrants could likely result in a hit to the U.S. labor force that would shrink the country’s gross domestic product, new data shows.

A working paper published this month from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative economics policy center, found the Trump administration’s immigration policy will likely result in a negative net migration in 2025—something the U.S. has not experienced in decades—that would shrink labor participation and “put significant downward pressure on growth in the labor force and employment.”

Net migration in 2025 will likely be between 525,000 individuals leaving the U.S. and 115,000 migrants entering the country, but will likely be negative, according to the report. With fewer immigrants in the country available to work, combined with a decrease in consumer spending—immigrants had $299 billion in spending power in 2023 and paid $167 billion in rent—U.S. GDP growth may shrink by between 0.3% and 0.4%. U.S. real GDP is about $23.5 trillion, which means the economic tradeoff of the deportations is roughly between $70.5 billion to $94 billion in lost economic output annually. The drag on what would usually be 2.8% annual growth would indicate a slowing in economic expansion as employers not only hire fewer people to fill fewer roles, but consumers spend less in an economically uncertain environment.

“Our workforce is disproportionately made up of immigrants relative to their share of the population, and because of that we…really can’t sustain a high level of job growth with the U.S.-born population alone, because there just aren’t enough bodies, essentially, to do that,” report co-author Tara Watson, a Brookings Institute economist and professor of economics at Williams College, told Fortune.

The foreign-born U.S. labor force—which made up 19.2% of the total labor force as of 2024—has shrunk by 735,000 people since January, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. But the departure of foreign-born workers in the U.S. now follows an immigration surge during the Biden administration, which helped create a swell of economic growth. The Congressional Budget Office projected the increase in migrants would boost the U.S. nominal GDP by $8.9 trillion between 2024 to 2034.

Meanwhile, the U.S.-born workforce is shrinking as many age out and retire.

Wendy Edelberg, Watson’s co-author and a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, called the projected loss of immigrant workers “startling” and sees more trouble on the horizon. The U.S. has seen a surge in work permit applications in the first half of 2025, suggesting to Edelberg that many immigrants—out of concern for Trump’s immigration policy—rushed to secure employment ahead of a crackdown, contributing to a healthy labor market and a 147,000 boost to payroll enrollment in June.

But “we’re not going to ride that wave forever,” Edelberg told Fortune. She and Watson projected a shrinking labor force would result in payment enrollment growth of only 30,000 to 40,000 per month in the second half of the year. This number would be healthy and not indicative of a recession because it will simply indicate a much lower ceiling for labor force growth, Edelberg said. If weak immigration continues into 2027, Edelberg predicted that the jobs figure could turn negative.

Trump’s immigration crackdown

Immigration has been the cornerstone of the Trump administration’s policy agenda, with the president on day one of his second term vowing to crack down on undocumented migrants to the U.S. Trump’s Big Beautiful Bill injected $45 billion into the Department of Homeland Security to expand deportation facilities and gives Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) more than $11 billion annually to increase its workforce of deportation officers.

The White House called AEI’s report on the negative economic impacts of mass deportations “baseless fear-mongering in defense of illegal immigration,” claiming that 10% of young adults in the U.S. are neither employed, in higher education, or seeking vocational training.

“There is no shortage of American minds and hands to grow our labor force,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson told Fortune in a statement. “President Trump’s mass deportation campaign means higher wages and more opportunity for American workers.”

Unlike Trump’s first term, in which he oversaw a more modest curtailing of immigration, the president has ramped up deportations after a sluggish start to his second administration, with Watson and Edelberg projecting the removal of about 300,000 immigrants in 2025 alone.

Beyond the nearly 67,000 immigrants the Trump administration has detained in fiscal 2025 and more than 71,000 deported, according to ICE data, others have self-deported or left voluntarily out of growing concern over hostile policies as part of the out-migration, according to AEI’s study. Watson warned net migration could be even lower in 2026, as the administration likely refuses to renew temporary work visas and foreign-born students snub American universities in favor of higher education opportunities elsewhere.

“The environment is going to make people like students reluctant to come study here,” Watson said. “Temporary workers may be questioning whether this is the right place for them to come to work.”

Widespread economic concerns

Businesses are seeing the early consequences of weakened immigration, with farm workers refusing to show up to work out of fear of ICE raids, Bloomberg reported. Nursing homes are similarly struggling to attract a workforce as the Trump administration revokes some immigrants’ legal status and slows the immigration process for documented migrants.

“We feel completely beat up right now,” Deke Cateau, CEO of Atlanta-based nursing home operator A.G. Rhodes, which has one-third of its staff made up of immigrants, told the Associated Press. “The pipeline is getting smaller and smaller.”

Beyond concern about a shrinking GDP, Apollo chief economist Torsten Sløk warned that if the U.S. were to deport 3,000 undocumented immigrants per day for a year, the country’s labor force would drop by 1 million people. Workplaces with high rates of immigrant employment could subsequently see an increase in wages as they struggle to attract workers.

“Lowering the labor force by 1 million will reduce the participation rate by 0.4 percentage points, which will lower the unemployment rate, lower job growth, and increase wage inflation, particularly in the sectors where unauthorized immigrants work—namely construction, agriculture, and leisure and hospitality,” Sløk said in a Saturday blog post.

“In short, deportations are a stagflationary impulse to the economy, resulting in lower

employment growth and higher wage inflation,” he continued.

While some parts of the U.S. could experience stagflationary environments, stagflation could be tempered in areas with large immigrant populations as their spending power wanes and demand for industries like housing construction decreases, Edelberg said.

Watson posited that besides GDP, shrinking immigration will most heavily be felt in Social Security. Undocumented immigrants paid $25.7 billion in Social Security taxes in 2022, according to a 2024 analysis by the left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy.

“There’s a very tight correlation between how many people are coming into the country and the degree to which we can sustain Social Security at its current levels going forward,” she said.

More broadly, the economic ramifications of Trump’s mass deportation campaign are only one part of the policy’s impact, Edelberg said, the other half being the palpable changes in the feeling within American cities spurred by ICE raids and the mobilization of the National Guard to accelerate deportations.

“The broad macroeconomic events are going to be pretty modest,” she said. “In terms of how we’re affected by this immigration policy, I think they will be dwarfed by how we engage with this policy, just in the images and in our communities.”",GNews,-2.79,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,36.91,"Fortune, fortune.com",,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/fortune,LEFT-CENTER,HIGH,USA,,Website,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,,,,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Center,Lean Left,fortune.com,,fortune,9,USA,,,,
19,210,"French plans to stop small boats will lead to more deaths, says charity",https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2025/jun/20/french-plans-to-stop-small-boats-will-lead-to-more-deaths-says-charity,2025-06-20T14:24:36Z,The Guardian,GB,migrant,"Plans by French police to enter the sea to stop small boats carrying UK-bound asylum seekers willcause more deaths and be challenged in the European courts, a French charity has said.

Arthur Dos Santos, the coordinator of the refugee charity Utopia 56, said there would be an increase in the number of people who would take “desperate” measures to reach the UK.

The official, based in Calais, said the charity was examining the possibility of a legal challenge in the European courts to stop the tactics.

Government sources have told the Guardian that French police would be authorised to tackle boats within 300 metres of the shore and in nearby waterways.

The strategy aims to be ready in time for the Franco-British summit, which begins on 8 July. This coincides with the state visit to London of Emmanuel Macron, the French president.

Over the past few days, French police have waded into the sea to stop asylum seekers from boarding boats, increasing speculation that police are already using the tactic.

In one incident this week at Gravelines beach near Dunkirk, officers were shown waist-deep in water, using CS gas, riot shields and batons, as they attempted to force a boat to return to the beach.

Dos Santos said the French plan to harden its tactics against asylum-seekers and smugglers would result in more deaths.

“When police enter the sea, it will cause more deaths, more people will drown as they try to get away before being caught and forced back to the beach. There will be more violence, as some people fight back, and the people attempting to reach England will find other ways to try to get to the UK. This will not stop them, but it will make the crossings much more dangerous,” he said.

The scheme is intended to give the French authorities the power to halt dinghies that “taxi” up to beaches from nearby waterways. Until now, guidelines prevent French police from intervening offshore unless it is to rescue passengers in distress. In practice, the policy means officers can stop boats leaving the beach by puncturing them, but are restricted once they are in the water.

Dos Santos said the tactic would face legal challenges in the European courts, with lawyers examining human rights laws and the UN convention on the law of the sea.

“This policy will be taken to the European courts. We will look very closely at this, as will other organisations,” he said.

A British charity that operates in France told the Guardian two weeks ago it planed to explore possible legal challenges to stop the tactic.

Steve Smith, the chief executive of Care4Calais, said: “When the last Tory government tried to do pushbacks in the Channel, Care4Calais initiated a legal challenge and won. Any attempt to introduce interceptions in French waters must face the same level of resistance.”

In 2024, 73 people died trying to cross the Channel in small boats, more than in the previous six years combined. Nine people this year have so far been reported dead or missing in the Channel.

Nearly 17,000 people have crossed in small boats so far in 2025, according to Home Office figures, higher than at the same point in 2022, the overall record year for crossings. On Wednesday, Downing Street acknowledged that the situation in the Channel was “deteriorating”.

26,210,Unions from 36 countries protest over treatment of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia,https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/04/unions-32-countries-protest-over-treatment-migrant-workers-saudi-arabia,2025-06-04T20:04:33Z,The Guardian,GB,migrant,"Trade unions from 36 countries have filed a complaint with the International Labour Organisation over the treatment of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia.

The complaint calls for a “commission of inquiry” into labour rights in the country, one of the most powerful tools available to the ILO, a United Nations agency. The demand comes amid growing concern that not enough is being done to improve the conditions of workers as development begins to scale up before the Fifa World Cup, due to take place in the Gulf state in 2034.

Luc Triangle, the general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, said the “scale and severity” of the issues in Saudi Arabia demanded the strongest response. “This is a call for immediate action towards genuine, inclusive and collaborative reform,” he said. “We cannot tolerate another death of a migrant worker in Saudi Arabia. We cannot remain silent while migrant workers, especially construction and domestic workers continue to face fundamental rights violations. This has to stop now.”

The news comes on the day the ILO announced a new cooperation agreement with Saudi Arabia, signed on the sidelines of its key annual gathering, the International Labour Conference, held in Geneva this week. Under the initial two-year agreement Saudi Arabia is expected to begin to align its laws with international labour standards.

Human rights groups and trade unions have repeatedly warned that the World Cup, and other major projects, could be tarnished by abusive conditions endured by migrant workers in constructing the necessary infrastructure. These concerns include extortionate recruitment fees, non-payment of wages, false contracts, passport confiscation and exposure to extreme heat. Thousands of workers could be likely to die as construction ramps up, the rights group FairSquare claimed last month.

The number of migrant workers in Saudi Arabia has surged in recent years to more than 13 million, driven in part by a massive construction boom linked to the World Cup and so-called giga-projects.

Saudi Arabia’s agreement with the ILO is understood to include proposals for new measures to support fair recruitment and make it easier for workers to change jobs, the introduction of a minimum wage and the inclusion of migrant workers on workers’ representative committees. Trade unions remain prohibited in the country.

The agreement also sets out commitments to improve the compensation system for workers who are injured or killed. In the longer term, it promises to strengthen protections for domestic workers, who have been excluded from key provisions of the labour law.

The planned reforms have failed to satisfy trade union delegates. Trade unions from the UK, Japan, Canada, Australia and 13 African countries including Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal pushed through the complaint, despite fierce opposition from the Saudis. The complaint, which the Guardian has seen, lists dozens of cases of alleged human trafficking, forced labour, wage theft and physical and sexual abuse of migrant workers.

“Africans go to Saudi Arabia looking for life but come back in coffins,” said Omar Osman, the general secretary of the federation of Somali trade unions and one of the signatories.

The complaint follows submissions made this year by the Building and Woodworkers International to the ILO over migrant workers in Saudi Arabia, and African trade unions raised with Fifa concerns over the treatment of workers.

Fifa says the human rights policy submitted as part of Saudi Arabia’s bid for the World Cup commits the country to embedding ILO standards as part of the 2034 process. In a letter to Human Rights Watch in April, the secretary general of Fifa, Mattias Grafström, wrote that “the work to implement the measures outlined in the bid strategy has started and is a priority for Fifa”. The trade union complaint is understood to acknowledge that this dialogue has begun.

479,259,Danish PM admits 'mass migration' is 'threat to the daily life in Europe',https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/world/3355107/danish-prime-minister-mette-frederiksen-heeds-jd-vance-mass-migration-warning-europe/,2025-03-21T17:22:19Z,Washington Examiner,US,mass migration,"Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, a socialist, agrees with her right-wing counterparts that mass migration into Europe is a significant threat to the continent’s way of life.

Frederiksen acknowledged in an interview with Politico this week that U.S. Vice President JD Vance had a point when he scolded European leaders in Munich last month, and she admitted that she considers “mass migration into Europe as a threat to the daily life in Europe.”

“The message that our populations in almost all European countries have tried to send to politicians through the years: Please get in control [of] our borders and be decisive on migration,” she said earlier this week.

“No matter if you look at statistics on crimes or if you look at problems on the labor market, insecurity in local communities, it is the most vulnerable who experience the consequences [of migration],” the prime minister said.

Conservative leaders across the Old Continent have sounded the alarm on the need to curb or outright end immigration, particularly from nations outside Europe where cultural mores differ greatly from Western values.

The electorates in Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and other nations are experiencing a marked shift rightward as frustration builds against establishment liberal governments’ inaction on rampant migration.

Frederiksen, a left-wing leader, bucks this trend with her blend of socialist policies and protectionist considerations that she believes fundamentally protect the blue-collar, working-class citizens most affected by migration and its consequences.

Between 2019 and 2024, Denmark accepted just 864 asylum claims.

“If I ask people about security and their security concerns, many of them will reply that Russia and defending Europe is top of mind right now. But security is also about what is going on in your local community,” Frederiksen said. “Do you feel safe where you live? When you go and take your local train, or when your kids are going home from school, or whatever is going on in your daily life?”

While noting that she deviates from Vance’s foreign policy position on matters such as Russian aggression, the prime minister acknowledged that the vice president was correct to reprimand European leaders in Munich during his landmark address last month — a speech she attended.

During the speech, Vance urged the political mainstream to take seriously the complaints of their voters across the political spectrum, accusing leaders of suppressing the will of their own people on issues such as immigration.

“What no democracy — American, German, or European — will survive is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns, their aspirations, their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered,” Vance said. “Democracy rests on the sacred principle that the voice of the people matters. There’s no room for ‘firewalls.’ You either uphold the principle or you don’t.”

Vance’s speech was particularly aimed at Germany, the European nation experiencing perhaps the most high-profile political crisis surrounding mass migration.

The Alternative for Germany party doubled its support to over 20% during the February parliamentary elections, taking second place with unprecedented opposition to both legal and illegal immigration.

Despite the AfD’s surge in popularity, the country’s mainstream parties refuse to engage with the AfD’s members in the Bundestag, dismissing them as too far to the right.

480,259,German voters join anti-mass migration movement,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/opinion/editorials/3328313/german-voters-join-anti-mass-migration-movement/,2025-02-25T05:01:00Z,Washington Examiner,US,mass migration,"Vice President JD Vance warned European leaders in Munich earlier this month that their efforts to silence dissent over policies that have produced record-high levels of foreign-born, culturally recalcitrant migrants were undermining their security. Now, with this deep problem uppermost in their minds, German voters have defeated the center-left Social Democratic Party and turned to the center-right Christian Democrats, while the Alternative for Germany, which is further to the right, nearly doubled its support.

According to exit polls, more German voters identified “immigration” as their nation’s “most pressing problem” than any other issue. Concerns about migrants beat out the economy by 3 points, 37%-34%, while crushing worries about “climate change,” 13%, and “inflation,” 7%. More than 82% of eligible Germans voted last weekend, making this year’s turnout the highest in more than 40 years.

It was not just older voters who moved right. Among men between the ages of 18 and 24, support for the anti-mass migration Alternative for Germany tripled from 8% to 24%, while support among women in that age group tripled from 5% to 15%.

“Of all the pressing challenges that the nations represented here face, I believe there is nothing more urgent than mass migration,” Vance told Europe. “Today, almost 1 in 5 people living in this country moved here from abroad. That is, of course, an all-time high. And we know the situation … it didn’t materialize in a vacuum. It’s the result of a series of conscious decisions made by politicians all over the continent and others across the world over the span of a decade.”

In recent years, the politicians who made those decisions to open their countries’ borders to a flood of migrants have been getting pummeled when voters get the chance to express their views in elections. In Germany, Italy, Sweden, Canada, and the United States, parties of the Left have been voted out of power after failing to secure their nations’ borders. In the United Kingdom, where a center-right government recently lost, it was solely because that party, too, failed to follow through on voter wishes to reduce immigration.

Only in Denmark has a center-left government managed to retain power, and the Danish government, unlike its counterpart in Germany, took strong action to reduce immigration.

In the U.S., in less than a month, and without any help from Congress, just by enforcing existing law, President Donald Trump has not only stopped more migrants from illegally entering the southern border but is also inducing migrants to return home.

Just by shutting down former President Joe Biden’s illegal CBP One parole program, Trump has created a “reverse flow” of migrants now heading south from the U.S. border back to Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, and Colombia. Where smugglers once charged $250 a person for boat rides north past Panama’s Darien Gap, they are now charging $250 a person for boat rides in the opposite direction.

EUROPE CAN’T HANDLE THE TRUTH

The Christian Democrats, who received 29% of the vote, have previously promised never to form a coalition government with Alternative for Germany, which received 21% of the vote. German law allows the government to spy on political parties it deems “extreme,” and the German government has been spying on Alternative for Germany for years now.

If the Christian Democrats insist on isolating Alternative for Germany, they will have no choice but to work with the party they just defeated, the Social Democrats. Forming coalition governments is always difficult, but if Christian Democrats want to build on their recent electoral success, they should make sure the Social Democrats responsible for Germany’s current immigration policies are kept out of power.",GNews,11.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Right,Reliable,34.02,"washington examiner, The Washington Examiner, Washington Examiner, washingtonexaminer.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/,https://ground.news/interest/washington-examiner,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-examiner,RIGHT-CENTER (3.8),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.2),USA,,Magazine,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Right,Clarity Media Group,2005,2.3,Lean Right,High,Lean Right,Lean Right,Lean Right,Lean Right,Lean Right,washingtonexaminer.com,,washington examiner,70,USA,Y,I,Washington Examiner,
481,143,Vance berates European leaders as tensions with close allies burst into the open,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/vance-ukraine-russia-deal-trump-military-tools-rcna192182,2025-02-14T20:46:43Z,NBC News,US,mass migration,"Vice President JD Vance publicly berated European leaders on a host of issues from free speech to security and mass migration, as simmering tensions between the United States and its close allies boiled over at an international conference in Munich on Friday.

The vice president used the podium at the high-level security gathering that had been focusing on the invasion of Ukraine and the threat Russia poses to Europe and the rest of the world to raise social issues animating many on the American right.

""The threat that I worry the most about vis-à-vis Europe is not Russia. It's not China. It's not any external actor,"" he said at the Munich Security Conference. ""What I worry about is the threat from within — the retreat of Europe from some of its most fundamental values, values shared with the United States of America.""

He added: “I’ve heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from and of course, that’s important. But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me ... is what exactly you’re defending yourselves for?”

The vice president's comments were met with an icy reception and only scattered applause — and groans when he joked about how if American democracy could ""survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg scolding, you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk.”

German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius denounced Vance's remarks during a session at the conference later in the day, saying in German that it was ""not acceptable"" that the U.S. vice president compared ""the condition of Europe with the condition that prevails in some auto-authoritarian regimes.""

""This is not acceptable,"" Pistorius said. ""This is not the Europe, not the democracy where I live and where I conduct my election campaign right now. And this is not the democracy that I witness every day in our parliament. In our democracy, every opinion has a voice.""

""I was in the room in Munich for VP Vance’s speech,"" Sen. Andy Kim, D-N.J., wrote in a post on X. ""No talk about Russia, Ukraine, China. Just criticisms of our allies and focus on “the threat from within.” His speech is going to embolden our adversaries who will see this as a green light to act while America is distracted/divided.""

Meeting with Zelenskyy

A rift between the U.S. and Europe had been growing after President Donald Trump was accused of excluding Kyiv and the continent from peace talks to end the nearly three-year war in Ukraine.

Later in the day, Vance, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Gen. Keith Kellogg, the U.S. special envoy for Ukraine and Russia, were part of the U.S. delegation that met directly with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other Ukrainian officials for a bilateral meeting at the conference.

“The goal is, as President Trump outlined it, we want the war to come to a close,"" Vance told reporters who were briefly brought into the room after the meeting started. ""We want the killing to stop, but we want to achieve a durable, lasting peace, not the kind of peace that’s going to have Eastern Europe in conflict just a couple years down the road.""

Zelenskyy thanked the U.S. and Trump for supporting Ukraine and said they will work toward a plan that addresses “how to stop Putin and finish the war.”

Before becoming vice president, Vance had conveyed in recent years that he wasn't a fan of providing U.S. assistance to Ukraine. After Russia invaded the country in February 2022, Vance said on a podcast, “I don’t really care what happens to Ukraine one way or another.” In the Senate, he voiced opposition to the Ukraine aid packages provided by Congress and under Biden.

Throughout the event in Munich, European leaders appeared to ramp up their criticism of the Trump administration's handling of peace efforts.

""The new American administration has a very different world view to ours, one that has no regard for established rules, partnership and grown trust,” German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier said at the conference Friday, prior to Vance's comments.

""We have to accept that and we can deal with it. But I am convinced that it is not in the interests of the international community for this worldview to become the dominant paradigm,” said Steinmeier, whose post is largely ceremonial, according to Reuters.

European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the world had reached a ""moment in history"" where ""great challenges loom,"" as she called on the international community to hold Russian President Vladimir Putin accountable for proving ""he has given up"" a bid to ""destroy Ukraine.""

There is growing alarm across Europe after what Trump described as a “lengthy and highly productive” conversation with Putin about ending the war in Ukraine.

Trump was accused of shutting Kyiv and Europe out of peace talks, while comments he made about the future of Ukraine prompted fear and anger in that country and across Europe.

Speaking at the security conference Friday, Zelenskyy said he had spoken with Trump and warned the American president not to believe Putin when he said he wanted to be part of a peace process.

“I said to him that he is a liar,” Zelenskyy said he told Trump about Putin, adding that he urged the U.S. president to increase pressure on Putin because, he said, ""I don’t trust him.”

Zelenskyy said it’s important that no decisions about Ukraine are made without Ukraine. He also said that in his first phone call with Joe Biden, the then-president told him Ukraine could not join NATO. The United States “never saw us in NATO,” Zelenskyy told attendees. “They just spoke about it, but they really didn’t want us in NATO.”

Friday’s security conference comes amid growing concerns over what actions Moscow might take if it is handed a win in Ukraine, particularly amid Trump’s suggestions that the U.S. would not defend NATO allies if they are attacked.

Last year, NATO members had indicated that Ukraine was on an “irreversible path” to eventual membership in the alliance. But both Trump and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth have indicated that NATO membership and Ukraine regaining lost territory are effectively off the table.

Asked Friday about Sen. Roger Wicker's comments that Hegseth ""made a rookie mistake"" by saying that a return to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders was ""unrealistic,"" Trump said he was ""generally aware"" of what Hegseth would say.

Trump was asked whether he blamed Ukraine or Russia for the war.

""I think that there were a lot — a lot of people to blame. All I can say is, very simply, if I were president, that war would never have happened,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office on Friday. ""You wouldn't have Russia and Ukraine fighting.""

Earlier, Vance may have offered European allies some reassurance in an interview with The Wall Street Journal, warning that Russia could face more sanctions and even military action if it refuses to agree to a deal ensuring Ukraine‘s long-term independence.

“There are economic tools of leverage, there are of course military tools of leverage,” Vance told the newspaper, describing the possible pressures the U.S. could apply. “There are any number of formulations, of configurations, but we do care about Ukraine having sovereign independence.”

Vance did not expand on those comments during his address to the security conference on Friday. Later, in posts on X, he said the news outlet ""twisted"" his words and that Trump ""is the ultimate deal maker and will bring peace to the region by ending the war in Ukraine.""

""As we’ve always said, American troops should never be put into harm’s way where it doesn’t advance American interests and security,"" he wrote. ""This war is between Russia and Ukraine.""

""The fact that the WSJ twisted my words in the way they did for this story is absurd, but not surprising considering they have spent years pushing for more American sons and daughters in uniform to be unnecessarily deployed overseas,"" he said in another post.

German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Friday condemned any plan for peace talks that does not involve Ukrainians and Europeans.

“A sham peace — over the heads of Ukrainians and Europeans — would gain nothing,” Baerbock said in a statement as the security conference got underway. “A sham peace would not bring lasting security, neither for the people in Ukraine nor for us in Europe or the United States,” she said, according to Reuters.

482,35,They fled repression in Venezuela. They may migrate again due to the US foreign aid freeze,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/02/13/americas/venezuela-migrants-colombia-cali-aid-freeze-intl-latam/index.html,2025-02-13T05:01:50Z,Cable News Network,US,mass migration,"Cali, Colombia CNN —

The sewing machines and computers sit collecting dust in the dark. They were once tools of hope and empowerment, a promise for those seeking to build a life for themselves.

This abandoned workshop is no ordinary factory. It is a vocational school in Cali, southwest Colombia, run by local contractors of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and was once a route for Venezuelan migrants like Alexandra Guerra to develop the skills to join the shoemaking industry.

The school offered the 25-year-old single mother of two a way to provide for her children, younger sister, and mother. USAID was even going to pay Guerra a daily subsidy while she looked for work.

But she saw her hopes crushed when the White House halted foreign aid last month. Her classroom was shuttered. Courses ceased. And the prospects of staying in Colombia looked bleak once again.

US President Donald Trump’s sweeping changes to foreign assistance led to the rapid dismantling of USAID. A freeze was put on foreign aid, USAID staffers worldwide were recalled, and several were placed on leave in the president’s apparent attempt to shut down the agency — which he had declared a waste of money.

But in Latin America, USAID had helped create economic opportunities for people like Guerra, according to the agency’s website before it was taken offline, giving migrants a degree of stability and, often, a reason to stay.

Sewing machines are seen at a vocational school once run by local contractors of the United States Agency for International Development. CNN

Its proponents say USAID helped curb migration at its root – the same phenomenon the Trump administration wants to stop with policies like mass deportations from the US, ICE raids, and reinforcement at the southern border.

Gustavo Vivas, the project director of the USAID program Guerra was enrolled in, says the new policy of cuts is contradictory.

“It is curious that a solution to many problems — including those related to migration — is being halted,” he told CNN, sitting in an IT classroom that’s been left unused since January 27. He added that their programs help to “prevent more Venezuelans from attempting to reach the United States.”

‘Any country will do’

Home to the largest Venezuelan migrant population in the world, Colombia is full of people with stories like Guerra’s.

In 2019, she left her village in Cojedes, Venezuela, and her family behind, making the trek to Colombia on foot. She was able to reunite with her family a year later after they joined her amid the pandemic lockdowns.

Last year, Guerra applied to the Safe Mobility Program as she set her sights on migrating to the United States legally.

Programs like Safe Mobility were Biden administration initiatives to offer legal routes for migrants in difficult situations to relocate safely in the US, such as Venezuelans and Nicaraguans fleeing authoritarian regimes.

But Guerra’s hopes were dashed when the program was shut down and her application was suspended last month, just a week before her classes were cancelled.

She has instead set her sights on migrating to Europe – where she would have to make the journey alone once again while her sons, aged four and eight, stay behind with their grandmother.

“Regardless that it’s not going to be the US, any country will do,” she said. “I want to work and earn enough to open my own business in Venezuela, one day… Right now, I’m a candidate for a job at an Italian airport. My doubt was that because Safe Mobility had shut, maybe the other [non-US] programs would also shut,” she said.

Guerra isn’t likely to be the only migrant in Colombia with dreams of leaving the country.

Colombian officials say closing USAID will push even more people to migrate as their country was one of the largest recipients of US aid funds in the world, with more than 82 programs worth almost $2 billion currently suspended because of Trump’s order.

‘Immigrants don’t leave their country just because they want to’

Other migrants, like Ayarith Olimpio, find themselves stuck in the aftermath of the aid freeze. They spoke to CNN about being unable to relocate and unable to foster the community they worked so hard to build.

She credits the team at the Cali vocational center for providing guidance through psychologists, advisors and mentors to support her beyond the classroom.

Ayarith Olimpio told CNN she wants Americans to accept her and understand the value she and other migrants could bring to the US. CNN

“Here, this center becomes the family network that can help you out. Maybe a friend you make at work, maybe a street neighbor you meet here,” she told CNN.

Yet, almost five years after settling down in Cali, Olimpio hasn’t given up the dream of moving to another country that could offer more opportunities than Colombia. Moving to the US is on the cards, but Olimpio says she would only do it via legal channels.

She told CNN she wants Americans to accept her and understand the value she and other migrants could bring to the US.

“A migrant is not just a face on social media, we are people!” she said, tears welling in her eyes while pointing out that many Venezuelans are fleeing disastrous economic conditions and brutal repression back home.

“Immigrants don’t leave their country just because they want to,” she explained.

Aid workers in turmoil

It’s not just migrants who are at the receiving end of the gutting of USAID. Colombian aid workers employed by US-funded programs have also found their lives upended.

Aid workers in Colombia assigned to USAID-funded programs told CNN they are seeing their contracts terminated.

One aid worker described an email she received from her employer, an NGO, announcing the suspension of US funding for her program.

“In the email they said: ‘We understand you have questions, and most likely we don’t have answers for them…’ I think that sums everything up pretty well: nobody knows anything other than the funding has been frozen,” said the aid worker, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of possible repercussions.

At the shuttered Cali vocational center, Olimpio says it saddens her to know others cannot access what USAID offered her. These are people who she says: “literally depend on what they learn.”

“There are people right now who are waiting for their opportunity, just like I waited and got it,” she said. “They don’t know if they’ll get it.",GNews,-6.23,,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnn-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.09,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/,https://ground.news/interest/cnn,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.7),USA,,TV Station/Website,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Turner Broadcasting System,1980,-1.3,Lean Left,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,edition.cnn.com,,cable news network,57,USA,Y,F,CNN,

The ecumenical religious service at the Catholic Basilica of St. Peter and Alexander in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, was briefly suspended for the tolling of the city’s bells at the exact time that the attack took place on Wednesday, 11:45 a.m.

Bavaria governor Markus Söder, Aschaffenburg Mayor Jürgen Herzing and Muslim imam Zischan Mehmood addressed the congregation that included rescuers, to express grief and disbelief at the loss of lives. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser was also present.

“Compassion, solidarity and cohesion are more important than ever, because there are many dividers and agitators around us,” Mehmood told the people gathered in and outside the church. “We must never allow grief and pain to tear us apart.”

Söder said the attack was a “senseless, brutal and disturbing crime.”

“Good and evil are not a question of origin, nationality, ethnicity or faith,” Söder said, and stressed that the killings should not lead to divisions because “incitement is the wrong answer.”

Before attending the service, Faeser and Söder laid wreaths at the site of the attack.

The attack is politically sensitive a month before Germany’s national election as migration policy is among the top campaign issues.

A 2-year-old boy of Moroccan origin, who was part of a group of kindergarten children, was killed, along with a 41-year-old German man who apparently intervened to protect the children in a city park. The arrested suspect is a 28-year-old former asylum-seeker from Afghanistan who had been told to leave Germany. Officials said he had received psychiatric treatment and there was no immediate indication that he was motivated by extremism.

He is being held in a psychiatric hospital, according to the German news agency, dpa.

BEIJING – China’s Lunar New Year travel rush has kicked into high gear, with billions of trips expected in coming days for the peak of the 40-day annual mass migration — the world's biggest annual movement of humanity.

The actual new year holiday, which marks the start of the year of the snake in the 12-month lunar calendar, comes on Wednesday, while New Year’s Eve on Tuesday is reserved for family gatherings and traditionally fireworks displays.

Many began travelling on Jan. 14 and the rush will reach a peak over the weekend. In total, 9 billion trips — mostly by car — are expected over the 40-day travel rush.

Trips by train will surpass surpass 510 million, with another 90 million travelling by air. The government didn't say how the travel figures compared with any other 40-day period during the year.

Trips are now far more comfortable than in past years, when travelers often crammed into train cars for trips that could last days — if they were fortunate enough to buy a ticket, which are now mostly sold online.

Traditionally the festival has been a time for families to gather, with members of China’s huge migrant worker population using up all their vacation time on the annual visit that for many offers the only chance to see parents and children.

Rising prosperity and the decline in family customs in recent years has prompted those with the means to travel overseas, mostly to South East Asia, but also Japan and South Korea. Cross-border trips are expected to rise by nearly 10%, including foreign tourists willing to risk the crowds to take in the spectacle.

486,189,League table of foreign criminals awaiting deportation and their offences set to be published,https://news.sky.com/story/league-table-of-foreign-criminals-awaiting-deportation-and-their-offences-set-to-be-published-13353517,2025-04-22T01:25:00Z,Sky News,GB,mass migration,"A league table of foreign criminals and their offences is set to be published for the first time.

The plans, due to be announced on Tuesday, will reportedly focus on those offenders awaiting deportation from the UK.

The latest data shows there were 19,244 foreign offenders awaiting deportation at the end of 2024, a rise from 17,907 when the Conservatives left office in July and 14,640 at the end of 2022.

Despite more offenders being deported since Labour came to power, the number waiting to be removed from the UK has been growing.

Factors are understood to include the early release of inmates due to prison overcrowding, instability and diplomatic problems in some countries and a backlog of legal cases appealing deportation.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the decision to publish the nationalities of foreign criminals showed Labour had ""buckled"" under pressure from the Conservatives to disclose the data.

The latest government statistics show there were 10,355 foreign nationals held in custody in England and Wales at the end of 2024, representing 12% of the prison population.

The most common nationalities after British nationals were Albanian (11%), Polish (8%), Romanian (7%), which also represented the top three nationalities who were deported from the UK in 2024, according to Home Office figures.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is understood to have ordered officials to release the details by the end of the year, according to The Daily Telegraph.

The newspaper reported Ms Cooper overruled Home Office officials, who previously claimed it was too difficult to provide quality data on foreign criminals.

A Home Office source said: ""Not only are we deporting foreign criminals at a rate never seen when Chris Philp and Robert Jenrick were in charge at the Home Office, but we will also be publishing far more information about that cohort of offenders than the Tories ever did.""

The source added that ministers wanted ""to ensure the public is kept better informed about the number of foreign criminals awaiting deportation, where they are from and the crimes they have committed"".

Foreign nationals sentenced to 12 months or more in prison are subject to automatic deportation, but the home secretary can also remove criminals if their presence in the UK is not considered desirable.

Shadow justice secretary Robert Jenrick welcomed the news, saying: ""We will finally see the hard reality that mass migration is fuelling crime across our country...

Nearly 50 bodies have already been uncovered, with fears authorities may still find more.

On Friday, 19 bodies were found in the first mass grave, according to Libyan authorities, with at least 28 more discovered on Sunday in a second mass grave - both in Kufra, in the southeast of the country.

The IOM, a United Nations agency, said that across the two mass graves, some of the bodies had gunshot wounds.

Al Abreen, a charity which helps migrants in Libya, also said some of the dead were apparently shot and killed.

At the second grave, Mohamed al Fadeil, head of the security chamber in Kufra, said survivors believed there were around 70 people buried there, meaning more bodies were likely to be recovered.

The nationalities of the dead remain unknown.

During the police raids which discovered the graves, 76 migrants were freed ""from forced detention"".

""The loss of these lives is yet another tragic reminder of the dangers faced by migrants embarking on perilous journeys,"" said Nicoletta Giordano, IOM's Libya chief of mission.

She added: ""Far too many migrants along these journeys endure severe exploitation, violence and abuse, underscoring the need to prioritise human rights and protect those at risk.""

Libya's attorney general said there had been three arrests during the raid on the second grave - of one Libyan and two foreigners.

It added that the gang allegedly responsible for the trafficking had subjected the migrants to violence and even ""tortured"" some.

Traffickers exploit chaos in Libya

Migrants' mass graves are not uncommon in Libya.

Last year, authorities discovered at least 65 migrants in a mass grave in the Shuayrif region, 220 miles (350km) south of the capital, Tripoli.

The country is a key part of the route for migrants from Africa and the Middle East trying to get to Europe.

Libya was plunged into chaos by a NATO-backed uprising that toppled and killed dictator Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

The oil-rich country has been ruled for most of the past decade by rival governments in its east and west, each backed by foreign governments and an array of militias.

488,210,Trump says vow to deport millions of undocumented people has ‘no price tag’,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/08/trump-mass-deportation-plan,2024-11-08T17:07:24Z,The Guardian,GB,mass migration,"Donald Trump’s vow to deport millions of undocumented immigrants has no “price tag”, the president-elect has said, setting the scene for a confrontation between his incoming administration and Democratic officials across the US.

As Democratic state governors and mayors signalled their determination to resist the most extreme elements of his agenda, Trump promised that his campaign pledge to expel an estimated 11 million people – though Trump himself has given a figure as high as 21 million – would be implemented come what may.

“It’s not a question of a price tag,” Trump told NBC.

“Really, we have no choice. When people have killed and murdered, when drug lords have destroyed countries, and now they’re going to go back to those countries because they’re not staying here. There is no price tag.”

The American Immigration Council has estimated that mass deportation on the scale Trump envisions could cost $315bn, including the broader economic costs through the impact on the US labour market.

Trump’s comments, given in a phone interview with the network’s Kristen Welker, reinforced an uncompromising message declared to his supporters on election night as victory became certain. “I will govern by a simple motto: promises made, promises kept,” he said.

But the renewed deportation vow has set him on a collision course with Democratic state officials who said they would push back amid separate reports that the new Trump administration would defund states, cities and law enforcement agencies that did not cooperate or operate sanctuary policies for immigrants.

NBC News reported that Trump could withhold federal grants from police and sheriffs’ departments that refused to participate in programmes to round up immigrants.

Democratic officials lined up to say they were prepared to stand against Trump’s plan.

In California– home to one of the country’s largest immigrant population – the governor, Gavin Newsom, called a special state legislative session next month to “safeguard California values and fundamental rights in the face of an incoming Trump administration”.

Karen Bass, the mayor of Los Angeles – where one-third of the population is foreign-born – issued a statement of solidarity with its residents.

“No matter where you were born, how you came to this country, how you worship or who you love, Los Angeles will stand with you,” she said. “This is not a time for despair, this is a time for action. I’ve spoken with leaders across the city, the state and the country. We are ready.”

JB Pritzker, the governor of Illinois, announced plans to ask state legislators to address potential threats from Trump’s second presidency. “You come for my people, you come through me,” Pritzker told journalists.

Kathy Hochul, the Democratic governor of New York, said she would attempt to work with the new Trump administration but vowed to resist moves to restrict reproductive freedoms, roll back environmental control or loosen gun controls.

“If you try to harm New Yorkers or roll back their rights, I will fight you every step of the way,” she said in remarks aimed directly at Trump.

Concern over the effect of Trump’s immigration policy reached Canada, where officials have stepped up border security in preparation for an increase of immigrants fleeing anticipated round-ups and deportations.

Canada’s federal police said more people crossing the country’s border with the US between 2016 and 2023, related to Trump’s first win, had “provided us with the tools and insight necessary to address similar types of occurrences”.

The public safety minister, Dominic LeBlanc, told reporters that both the Royal Canadian Mounted police and the country’s border services were “ready for any eventuality”, adding that contingency plans had been in place for “several months”.

The outgoing Biden administration announced it was preparing to address a contrary concern: a mass upsurge of illegal border crossings into the US through its southern border before Trump takes office on 20 January, as smugglers seek to push people through before an expected crackdown is launched.

Concern over Trump’s intentions has also reached the armed forces, with the Pentagon bracing itself for upheavals amid consternation about his repeated campaign threats to use the military to crush internal dissent.

After Tuesday’s election victory, Lloyd Austin, the defence secretary, addressed the matter directly in a written memo, the Washington Post reported. He promised that the Pentagon would conduct a “calm, orderly, and professional transition to the incoming Trump administration”.

“As it always has, the US military will stand ready to carry out the policy choices of its next Commander in Chief, and to obey all lawful orders from its civilian chain of command,” Austin wrote. He added that the military must “continue to stand apart from the political arena”.

General John Kelly, Trump’s former chief of staff in his first term, told journalists during the campaign that Trump had repeatedly mused that he hankered after having military commanders that were personally loyal to him in the manner German generals showed Adolf Hitler.

Rachel VanLandingham, a former US air force attorney, said dangers of the military being used to suppress internal opposition were high.

“They will follow President Trump’s orders, particularly because the president can lawfully order domestic use of the military in a wide variety of situations,” she told the Post.

“There is huge risk in disobeying a president’s order, and seemingly little risk in obeying it.”",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

Lawyers representing the families of British hostages held by Hamas, those who have been released, and those who have been killed, have just released a statement on the UK government's policy on Palestine recognition.

The group, along with their lawyers Adam Rose and Adam Wagner, met with unnamed ""senior officials"" at the Foreign Office, and they say the UK government's policy risks harming the 50 hostages still being held by Hamas.

The lawyers said: ""It was clear from the meeting last night that the British government's policy will not help the hostages, and could even hurt them.""

Up until this point, the lawyers said the families had been ""encouraged by knowing that the UK has until now sought to apply pressure on all parties - Israel and Hamas - to get the hostages out"", but the policy of recognising Palestine ""appears to be to put pressure on the Israelis only to reach a deal"".

""We have already raised concerns that the structure of the British 'offer' would disincentivise Hamas from agreeing a deal. Why would Hamas agree to a ceasefire if it knew that to do so would make British recognition of Palestine less likely?"" they said.

While they ""held out some hope"" that the UK government's policy ""could not be as they feared"" as they did not think Hamas would ""essentially be rewarded for continuing to commit war crimes, including hostage taking, and encouraged to continue that path""

But they say it is clear that the government policy ""will not help the hostages, and could even hurt them"".

""We do not say this lightly, but it was made obvious to us at the meeting that although the conditions for recognising a Palestinian state would be assessed 'in the round' in late-September, in deciding whether to go ahead with recognition, the release or otherwise of the hostages would play no part in those considerations,"" the lawyers wrote.

""In other words, the 'vision for peace' which the UK is pursuing, and which the families heard much about last night, may well involve our clients' family members continuing to rot in Hamas dungeons, just as British and British-linked hostages Emily Damari and Eli Sharabi did before them.""

The families ""implore the prime minister to change course before it is too late"", and to confirm that ""without the hostages being released, there can be no peace"", which must be considered as part of recognition plans.",GNews,-0.78,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/sky-news-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.79,"sky news, SkyNews, Sky News UK, sky.com/news, sky.com",,https://ground.news/interest/sky-news,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/sky-news-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,,,,Center,High,Center,Unknown,Left,Lean Left,Center,news.sky.com,,sky news,31,UK,Y,E,Sky News,
451,150,"One year on, tensions still circle Britain’s asylum-seeker hotels",https://www.newstatesman.com/cover-story/2025/07/one-year-on-tensions-still-circle-britains-asylum-seeker-hotels,2025-07-30T06:52:34Z,New Statesman,GB,asylum,"In the Park Hotel car park, a little boy bounced around in the drizzle as his mother watched on from the foyer door. This was his makeshift playground: kids’ bikes on a rack, a basketball net furring with moss. Families including 34 adults and 46 children live at this hotel – in the centre of Diss, a small market town in Norfolk – contracted by the Home Office in 2023 to house asylum seekers. They have come from Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, Somalia and Eritrea. When I visited, they were in limbo in more ways than one: not just waiting for refugee status or a permanent home, but to find out if they would be replaced by a group of asylum-seeking single men.

Imposed by the Home Office with little notice, this plan sparked a protest on 21 July. Around 150 people turned up to oppose the hotel’s use, chanting, “We want our country back.” It turned aggressive, when some crossed the road to confront counter-protesters. Local politicians accused out-of-town activists of stirring up trouble. Two men were charged with public order offences. A Norfolk reporter said the crowd had “turned on” him and warned me to be careful as I wandered up the quaint high street of wool shops and stalls of fresh fish and hog roast.

“We used to have lovely Christmas dinners there,” recalled Martyn Thorndyke, 34, who works nights at a factory and often went for a pint at the hotel. “But I guess they don’t celebrate that there now, do they?” A 36-year-old woman suggested sheltering asylum seekers in tents. “If it was me and I had to flee, I’d absolutely flee. But there’s no housing for them here.” A fisherman, testing out some equipment in the lake, had another idea: “They should have great white sharks patrolling Dover.”

As the rain hung eyelash-thin and seagulls eddied above, the town tensed up. Police parked around the corner from the hotel. Further protests had been scheduled. The hotel owners were in a stand-off with government, threatening to close if they had to take solely men. “We don’t know what will happen, it’s up to the Home Office,” said an employee. Another told me the hotel residents – who have cooked for people in Diss, taken English lessons at the library and sent their children to local schools – were distressed.

Locals spoke, some unprompted, about the “young, fit men” due to arrive. Emma Lummis, 47, a school worker, had banned her 13-year-old daughter from going out in the town centre, or wearing a short skirt. “You just don’t know who these people are. We’re not racist. It’s not about whether you’re white or not; it’s about whether you’re a wrong ’un.”

A 55-year-old woman who had collected donations and organised craft events for the families told me they had “integrated” and “Diss is a very welcoming town” – just not the place for young men. “Just like the ‘professionally unemployed’ British guys drinking in the park, they would have nothing to do here but hang around.” When the riots hit last summer, she said police warned her to keep her activities at a “low profile”.

There are 210 hotels housing 32,345 asylum seekers across the UK – a drop since the height of 400 housing 56,042 in 2023. This July, protests spread through Diss, Norwich, Portsmouth, Bournemouth, Leeds, London’s Canary Wharf and Epping in Essex. Far-right figures have attended and coordinated protests via social media. Stand Up to Racism counter-protesters rally in response.

The asylum hotel policy could be a parable for all that is wrong with the British state. The Conservatives under-resourced asylum claim processing. Channel crossings rose despite government promising the reverse. Ministers commandeered much-loved venues at short notice, cancelling wedding receptions and birthday parties. And this was all contracted out to private providers such as Serco, costing the taxpayer £15bn. It is a tired tale of cuts, broken pledges, neighbourhood neglect and poor-value outsourcing. But a subplot fraught with rumour and racism is darkening the story. Reporting around England in recent years, again and again I have encountered the same fears: that these newcomers might assault women and girls.

Riots in Southport and Ballymena over the past two years had the same trigger: charges of attacks on young girls. The Best Western Brook Hotel in Bowthorpe, Norwich – a site of recent protests – was home to a man now imprisoned for raping a woman, and another for asking a 14-year-old boy to send naked pictures. At Epping’s Bell Hotel, there have been both violent clashes and peaceful protests after one resident, now in custody, was charged with sexual assault for allegedly attempting to kiss a 14-year-old girl (which he denies).

Such cases have led to the demonisation of young male asylum seekers as potential criminals and sex offenders. The memory of working-class white girls groomed by British-Pakistani gangs pulses through these suspicions. Victims then were ignored by authorities, partly down to political correctness – a fact that emboldens some people to voice Islamophobic generalisations about the attitudes of certain men towards women.

Police National Computer data suggesting Afghans and Eritreans are more than 20 times more likely to be convicted of sexual offences than British citizens are widely shared. Officials warn, however, that this data neither accounts for gender nor for how much younger these ethnic groups are than the British average (young men generally are more likely to commit crime), that it is “not reliable for nationality” as it omits dual nationals and that it doesn’t reflect the number of repeat offenders.

After violence outside the Bell Hotel, where officers were injured and 17 protesters arrested, Keir Starmer warned of a second summer of riots. Unrest last year followed the murder of three girls in Southport. The perpetrator, born in Britain to Rwandan parents, was falsely said to be a Muslim asylum seeker who had arrived on a small boat – disinformation that led to rioters attacking a mosque and setting an asylum hotel on fire.

Anger is not just confected online in bad faith. At one Epping protest, I was struck by the dissonance between mums waving suffragette flags and grandmas Sharpie-ing “Protect Our Kids” on to M&S bags for life, and the presence of ex-British National Party councillors and a member of Homeland, a far-right splinter group of the neo-Nazi Patriotic Alternative.

Wearing a T-shirt with the slogan “Save Our Children”, the vice-chairman of Reform UK’s Epping Forest branch, Orla Minihane, described this wave of protest to me as a “#MeToo moment”. “Women won’t go out for runs, they’re getting their husbands to pick them up from the station, they’re scared to walk their dogs,” she said. “I’m sure most of the men in there are good, decent people – but we don’t know.” She waved a suffragette flag among the rippling St George’s Crosses.

“When we walk past a woman with a child, she pulls the child behind her as if we are going to take them – it is so painful to see,” said Khadar, 20, a Somali asylum seeker living at the Bell Hotel who crossed the Channel three months ago. “We are not here to hurt you. It was very good here before the incident. Now we feel uncomfortable and there is a lot of tension; people treat us like we’re criminals and say insulting words.”

Another young Somali man at the Bell Hotel, who preferred not to be named, had been chased by a group of men while shopping. Even as warm sunshine soaked the tree tops of Epping Forest opposite, he pulled a thick black jacket around him and glanced around as we spoke. “I was very scared.”

“Sexual violence and crime impacts all communities and involves perpetrators of all races,” said Georgie Laming, of the anti-fascist campaign group Hope not Hate. “It’s clear from Epping how an arrest, an allegation or a rumour can quickly take hold, be whipped up and racialised by the far right.”

Rumours were ripping through the protests outside the Bell Hotel. I was told repeatedly that Essex Police had bussed anti-racism activists towards the demonstration – a story the force denies but which is all over social media and has been repeated by Nigel Farage. Numerous protesters also told me hotel residents were shoplifting from Tesco, but the police had no reports of this, and the local Tesco had no knowledge of it either. Since 2020, the year asylum seekers moved into the Bell, instances of rape, reports of antisocial behaviour and the number of robberies have dropped in the area.

There is also misapprehension that the hotels are five-star experiences for their new guests. “They’re fed and watered, have hot showers, for free,” said an Epping local of 45 years. “But for us living here, the town has gone downhill.” In Diss, the school worker I met said: “We’re working our arses off and they’re given a lovely hotel, clean sheets every morning, it’s plush.”

In reality, those with knowledge of the Park Hotel talked of breakfast running out, children going hungry and women asking for donations of buckets and mops because of uncleanliness. At another hotel, I’ve seen a four-year-old scarred from bed-bug bites and families falling sick from undercooked chicken. I’ve also heard of young people forced to share rooms with adult strangers. The children’s commissioner for England, Rachel de Souza, found a “troubling” lack of safeguarding at these hotels.

Such details don’t resonate, though, when the world outside the hotels is one of low wages, housing shortages and a crumbling public realm. “You’ve got to look after your own first,” said the factory operative. “We need stuff given to English people, they haven’t got houses themselves,” said the school worker. “This town is empty, it’s dead; people haven’t got money to shop anymore. I worry about my future grandchildren: life is shit now, what will life be for them?”

Deprivation and social dislocation, not levels of immigration, were the most common factors in riot-hit areas last summer, according to a report shared exclusively with the New Statesman that has been read in No 10. “This Place Matters”, by Citizens UK, UCL Policy Lab, and More in Common, finds no consistent correlation between high immigration to an area and low social cohesion.

Rather, integration is what counts. The constituencies that experienced unrest all have populations where more people feel “disconnected” than “connected”. While financial insecurity is one of the strongest predictors of disconnection, the report identifies other alienating trends: neglected high streets and town centres, the decline of in-person socialising, and a loss of “associational life” – fewer communal spaces where people interact, remote working and even self-checkouts.

In a town of shuttered shops and fly-tipping – where children’s centres and social housing and the municipal fireworks display are just a memory – it is little wonder you look up less from your phone. And when that screen is full of lurid innuendo, shared by politicians and activists who have no beguiling slogans for public service reform or community renewal, it only takes a spark to light the tinder.

“In Somalia, I couldn’t work because I was in a rural area ruled by militia. I wanted to come to England for a better life, to contribute, not to depend on government, and it took ten hours on the boat – so long and painful with people suffocating,” said Khadar of the Bell Hotel. “I thought England was a good place, more welcoming than Europe, and would help a lot. Now it feels like a hostile land.”

491,98,Six Million Animals Make Moves In The World’s Largest Land Mammal Migration,https://www.iflscience.com/six-million-animals-make-moves-in-the-worlds-largest-land-mammal-migration-74827,2024-06-26T14:16:41Z,IFLScience,GB,mass migration,"Around 6 million antelope have been recorded on a trek across East Africa, marking the world’s largest land mammal migration ever recorded.

The scale of the Great Nile Migration recently became apparent through an ongoing project between African Parks and the Government of South Sudan.

Between April 28 and May 15, 2023, after the first rains of the season, planes were used to carry out an extensive aerial survey of the Boma Badingilo Jonglei Landscape in the east of South Sudan, documenting the migration of roughly 5 million white-eared kob, 300,000 tiang, 350,000 Mongalla gazelle, and 160,000 Bohor reedbuck.

“The results of this survey are nothing short of staggering. The astonishing scale of the migration is only equaled by the responsibility to ensure that it survives into the future in an extremely complex landscape,” Peter Fearnhead, CEO of African Parks, said in a statement.

Along with the galavanting antelopes, the survey noted how elephants, giraffes, lions, and cheetah populations have persisted in the area. Likewise, there are still massive populations of large birds, including open-billed stork, marabou stork, yellow-billed stork, Abdim’s stork, woolly-necked stork, black-crowned cranes, herons, and several species of vultures.

While this may suggest that wildlife is abundant in the region, its biodiversity is facing a myriad of threats. Comparisons with surveys carried out in the 1980s show there's been “catastrophic declines of most sedentary species,"" such as elephant, warthog, cheetah, hippopotamus, and buffalo.

One of the main threats is illegal poaching, which Fearnhead said is “at a scale that we have never witnessed before.”

To make matters more difficult, South Sudan went through a bloody civil war over the last few decades, and ethnic violence still lingers. Along with causing immense human suffering, the conflict has impacted the movement of animals and made wildlife surveys almost impossible.

As the country strives to recover, the future of these rich ecosystems could ultimately hinge on how human relations in the area resolve.

“This wildlife and larger ecosystem is the basis for survival for multiple ethnic groupings which are often in conflict with each other over resources. Successful management of this landscape will only be possible through building trust with and amongst these ethnic groupings,” explained Fearnhead.

“Working with these local communities to protect this vital ecosystem will help perpetuate this global phenomenon whilst also bringing about stability, safety, and security and creating a sustainable future for the people who live in this area – many of whom are still recovering after years of war and disruption,” he continued.",GNews,,,not found,,,,"IFL Science, IFLScience.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ifl-science/,https://ground.news/interest/iflscience,not found,LEFT-CENTER (-4.5),HIGH (1.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Unknown,Lean Left,iflscience.com,,iflscience,146,United Kingdom,,,,
492,210,"Putin seeking to weaponise threat of mass migration, warns Estonian PM",https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/may/17/putin-is-seeking-to-weaponise-threat-of-ukraine-mass-migration-says-estonian-pm,2024-05-17T14:29:35Z,The Guardian,GB,mass migration,"Vladimir Putin is seeking to weaponise the threat of mass migration to divide and weaken Europe as supporters of Ukraine struggle to maintain unity to defeat Russia, Kaja Kallas, the Estonian prime minister, says.

“What our adversaries know is migration is our vulnerability,” she said. “The aim is to make life really impossible in Ukraine so that there would be migration pressure to Europe, and this is what they are doing.”

Speaking in Tallinn on Friday, she said Russia had already created the migration pressure through disruption in Syria and in Africa via the Wagner group.

“I think we have to understand that Russia is weaponising migration. Our adversaries are weaponising migration.

“They push the migrants over the border, and they create problems for the Europeans because they weaponise this since with human rights, you have to accept those people. And that is, of course, water to the mill of the far right.”

Kallas admitted the plight of the Ukrainians on the front was “very serious” and European promises of extra weapons had not been delivered, something that could be rectified if Nato took charge of coordinating weapons delivery. “The problem is that our promises do not save lives,” she said.

Kallas is one of many European politicians trying to spell out the many negative consequences to Europe of a Ukrainian defeat, and rebut those who claim such a reverse could be contained.

She was speaking the day after the former Estonian president Toomas Ilves predicted that if Ukraine fell to Russia as many as 30 million Ukrainians would seek to flee. “That is the threat we face due to our inaction,” he said, adding that Europe had a “complete meltdown” when faced with 2 million refugees from the Middle East in 2015.

A pamphlet produced by pro-Ukrainian NGOs has detailed how Russian shelling between October 2022 and January 2023 had increased migration out of Ukraine by a quarter compared with the previous year.

The recent round of attacks has targeted electricity generation rather than transmission. Olena Halushka, board head at the international centre for a Ukrainian Victory, said: “Right now they are trying to bomb Ukraine into the stone age,” adding that in the past two months more damage had been inflicted than the whole of the winter of 2023.

She said: “Europe needs to think about Kharkiv, a city the size of Munich without energy this winter and then think about the financial implications of tens of millions of Ukrainians fleeing the war due to fear of occupation”.

Kallas said Russian assaults were now targeting Ukrainian cities every day and night.

She conceded that, based on geography and history, some countries in Europe did not see the threat of a Ukrainian defeat in the same way. “They don’t see and they don’t believe that if Ukraine falls Europe is in danger, the whole of Europe, maybe some countries, but not the whole of Europe”.

She said she feared a mistake was being made similar to the late 1930s, when linked conflicts were seen as isolated events. Kallas, tipped as a possible successor to Josep Borrell as EU high commissioner for foreign policy, cited links between the conflicts in Azerbaijan and Armenia, the Middle East, and the South China Sea. She said the same error was made in the 1930s about the Italian invasion of Ethiopia, the German occupation of Austria and the Sino-Japanese war.

“The lesson from 1938 and 1939 is that if aggression pays off somewhere, it will be taken up elsewhere. Ukraine’s defeat is something all aggressors will learn from. They will learn that in 2024, bluntly, you can just colonise another country and nothing happens to you.”

She pointed to what she described as baby steps to strengthening the European defence architecture, including a European defence fund, the increase in individual nation state defence spending, and the proposal for a shared defence debt bond to boost spending. She denied Estonia had had any serious discussions about sending troops to Ukraine, while arguing at the same time it was better to keep Putin guessing about Europe’s plans.

She said it was also a valid criticism that Ukraine was not moving fast enough to mobilise more troops.

Meanwhile, Russia’s foreign ministry warned the west it was playing with fire by allowing Ukraine to use western missiles and weapons to strike Russia, and said it would not leave such actions unanswered.

The foreign ministry said in a statement that it saw the hand of the US and Britain behind a recent spate of attacks, and blamed Washington and London for escalating the conflict by authorising Ukraine to use long-range rockets and heavy weapons they had supplied against Russian targets.

“Once again, we should like to unequivocally warn Washington, London, Brussels and other western capitals, as well as Kyiv, which is under their control, that they are playing with fire. Russia will not leave such encroachments on its territory unanswered,” the ministry said.

493,210,"Mass grave of at least 65 people found in Libya, UN migration agency says",https://www.theguardian.com/world/2024/mar/22/mass-grave-libya-un-migration-agency,2024-03-22T16:24:09Z,The Guardian,GB,mass migration,"A mass grave containing at least 65 bodies has been discovered in south-west Libya this week, the UN migration agency said on Friday.

A spokesperson for the International Organization for Migration (IOM) said the mass grave was uncovered by Libyan security forces.

The IOM said in a statement it was “profoundly shocked and alarmed”. It added that the circumstances of the deaths “remains unknown, but it is believed that they died in the process of being smuggled through the desert”.

More than a decade of violent instability since the 2011 overthrow and killing of the dictator Muammar Gaddafi in a Nato-backed uprising helped turn Libya into a fertile ground for people-smugglers and traffickers, who have long been accused of abuses against migrants.

The IOM said it appreciated that Libyan authorities had launched an investigation into the deaths. It called on them to “ensure a dignified recovery, identification and transfer of the remains of the deceased migrants”, and notify and assist their families.

The spokesperson said: “Each report of a missing migrant or a loss of life represents a grieving family searching for answers about their loved ones or acknowledging the tragedy of the loss.

“The cost of inadequate action is evident in the increasing human deaths and the disturbing conditions migrants find themselves in.”

The IOM said the deaths showed “the urgent need to address the challenges of irregular migration including through a coordinated response to the smuggling of migrants and trafficking in persons”.

“Without regular pathways that provide opportunities for legal migration, such tragedies will continue to be a feature along this route,” it said.

According to the IOM’s Missing Migrants project, at least 3,129 deaths and disappearances were recorded in 2023 along the Mediterranean route to Europe, making it the world’s deadliest migratory route.

The IOM called on authorities in countries along the route to “enhance regional cooperation to ensure the safety and protection of migrants, regardless of their status, and across all stages of their journeys”.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
475,150,Blame Rotherham sexual abuse on misogyny – not immigration,https://www.newstatesman.com/politics/society/2025/08/blame-rotherham-sexual-abuse-on-misogyny-not-immigration,2025-08-01T09:49:01Z,New Statesman,GB,immigration,"“In a world where you were being abused so much, being raped once was a lot easier than multiple rapes and I think he knew that.”

This is the account of a woman exploited as a child by a grooming gang in Rotherham. The “he” in that quote refers not to a gang member but to an officer in the South Yorkshire Police. BBC News reported that the woman said she “was raped from the age of 12 by a serving South Yorkshire Police (SYP) officer in a marked police car. He would threaten to hand her back to the gang if she did not comply.”

Her story is not an anomaly. The BBC, which broke the story on 29 July, says it has seen accounts from 30 witnesses detailing years of abuse of grooming gang victims by the police whose job it was to keep them safe. Many of these testimonies have been handed over to police, and a criminal investigation into South Yorkshire Police has been launched – incredibly, under the authority of SYP itself. So far, at least five women have come forward alleging abuse, and three former SYP officers have been arrested on suspicion of historic sexual offences.

The details of the allegations are harrowing – including one survivor recalling how one of the officers who had been abusing her turned up to interview her about an illegal abortion she had been pressured into having by the grooming gang. But they are not new. Lawyers for the women claimed they had told authorities about these allegations for years, and that demands for an inquiry had been “resisted”. This came after an eight-year investigation into the SYP’s handling of grooming gangs in Rotherham upheld complaints against 43 officers, with some facing gross misconduct charges.

It’s not the first time this week the spotlight has been focused on the police – and whether or not the public can trust them. On Monday (28 July), I attended Reform UK’s second press conference on crime in as many weeks, at which Nigel Farage reiterated his party’s pledge to recruit 30,000 new officers, funded in part from scrapping all diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) roles. The Reform leader also repeatedly stressed the link between high immigration and crime, particularly violent and sexual crime against women and girls.

During the Q&A, I asked how these two aims – scrapping DEI and protecting women and girls – aligned, given the problems police forces face regarding an institutionally misogynist culture. We know that the convictions of Wayne Couzens, the Metropolitan Police officer who raped and murdered Sarah Everard, and David Carrick, who spent 20 years using his position in the Met to rape and abuse women – not to mention numerous other allegations and convictions for assault and misconduct – have led to a decline in trust among women that police will take reports of rape and assault seriously. This is not confined to one police authority: data from the National Police Chiefs’ Council in 2023 found that more than 1,500 officers from police forces in England and Wales had been accused of violence against women and girls in a six-month period. There were signs that national policing bodies were undertaking welcome scrutiny of the working culture and practices that had enabled such crimes. Did the broadside against DEI (and, indeed, female police officers themselves) mean the work to tackle that culture was over?

I’d addressed my question to both Farage and to Colin Sutton, the retired DCI who is leading Reform’s law-and-order task force. Sutton blamed the crimes of Couzens and Carrick on austerity-related cuts to training and vetting programmes (even though the latter joined the Met in 2001), and denied there was any link between their behaviour and the culture of the forces in which they worked. Farage dodged the question entirely.

The news of the Rotherham victims accusing South Yorkshire police officers of abusing them had not yet been published. Farage did discuss the story on his GB News show on Wednesday, using the latest details as a hook to push the narrative again that “diversity” under the Blair government was the main driver of the scandal. He called the allegations “shocking” – the same word used by Kemi Badenoch, who also said the story was “proof that we do need a national inquiry. That’s the only thing that’s going to get to the bottom of what actually happened.”

Yet these allegations, and others like them about abuse from police officers, have been absent from the raging political debate over the multi-decade grooming gangs scandal. They were not discussed when the scandal was reignited at the start of 2025 by the sudden interest from figures such as Elon Musk, nor when Louise Casey published her rapid review on 16 June. When Yvette Cooper, the Home Secretary, addressed the House following Casey’s review and announced that the government would pursue a national inquiry after all, her statement condemned the failures on the part of institutions – including the police – that enabled exploitation to continue, but steered clear of any insinuation that police corruption may have played a part.

She did, however, focus heavily on the ethnicity aspect of the report: that is, the “clear evidence of over-representation among suspects of Asian and Pakistani-heritage men”, and Casey’s findings of “examples of organisations avoiding the topic altogether for fear of appearing racist or raising community tensions”.

This is the element that fits the prevailing political narrative: of an institutional “cover-up” on a huge scale carried out by police forces, social services and local government officials because the victims in these horrific cases were white girls and the perpetrators were predominantly Asian men, and people in positions of authority cared more about looking open-minded than they did about protecting children from rape. It is why the scandal, which dates back to the 1990s and has been widely covered since the 2010s, has become a recent source of conspiracy theories regarding Keir Starmer and his current cabinet, and a rallying call for anti-woke crusaders on both sides of the Atlantic.

And, as Casey confirmed, it is an important and previously overlooked part of the conversation. There has been a reluctance on the part of people in positions of authority to collect data on the ethnicity of perpetrators. Concern about “community tensions” was a key factor in why the rape and abuse of thousands of young girls failed to be tackled seriously.

But it was never the only factor. And the desire on the part of those pushing an anti-woke agenda – of politically correct police letting men of Pakistani origin commit rape so as not to be labelled racist – has bulldozed everything else out of the story.

While the role of ethnicity has been a huge talking point in this conversation, the role of misogyny – in particular, institutional misogyny within police forces – has been sidestepped. There have been countless discussions on the need to collect data on ethnicity and “have an honest conversation” about immigration and integration, yet virtually none on how authorities treat vulnerable women who come forward with accounts of sexual abuse.

Nor has there been much discourse on the sexualisation of young girls in the eyes of society that led to, as Cooper put it in her statement, “a deep-rooted failure to treat children as children”. There’s a harrowing scene in Three Girls, the 2017 BBC dramatisation of the Rochdale grooming gangs scandal, in which a social worker is concerned only with the welfare of an underage victim’s unborn baby and has to be reminded that the soon-to-be-mother is herself a child. Where has the outrage been about situations like that? Or about the cultural consensus in the 1990s and 2000s that determined which victims deserved to be taken seriously and which could be disregarded – as “unreliable”, “troubled”, “doing it for attention”, or simply “bad girls” – irrespective of the colour of their rapist’s skin? Or about the role some police officers may have played not just in ignoring abuse, but in perpetrating it?

The people who focus on immigration over all else and reject the role of institutional misogyny and wider societal attitudes to rape don’t seem interested in making life safer for women and girls. The narrative that it is immigrants who are the biggest threat to women’s safety – and woke attitudes to said immigrants that are the biggest barrier to the institutions tasked with protecting us all from doing so – is alluringly simple. But it’s also dishonest, drowning out the voices of survivors and those invested in actually reducing sexual violence rather than scoring political points. It’s not “woke” to want to tackle the toxic culture within some police forces that enables abusers to rise into positions of power, any more than it is to ask why some people seem predominantly interested in the ethnicity angle.

Perhaps the long-awaited national inquiry will confront some of these uncomfortable realities. Perhaps the investigation by South Yorkshire Police into itself will succeed where others have failed and survivors will finally get the justice they deserve. Perhaps Reform UK will acknowledge that it’s not all about immigration and admit there may be a place for diversity efforts to reform police forces after all. Because anyone insisting there’s a simple answer to this web of institutional failure doesn’t care about women and girls. They just care about their own agenda.

495,204,Britain hopes a crackdown on people-smugglers’ social media ads will help curb Channel crossings,https://apnews.com/article/english-channel-migrants-smuggling-gangs-0d0ea1736c79d711ba8b35142d198fc0,2025-08-03T13:57:12Z,The Associated Press,US,channel crossings,"LONDON (AP) — Britain says people who advertise fake passports or people-smuggling services on social medial could face up to five years in prison, in the government’s latest effort to deter migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats.

The government said Sunday that anyone convicted of creating online materials intended to break U.K. immigration law will face prison time and a large fine.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the aim was to stop the “brazen tactics on social media” used by smuggling gangs.

“Selling the false promise of a safe journey to the U.K. and a life in this country — whether on or offline — simply to make money, is nothing short of immoral,” she said.

Assisting illegal immigration to the U.K. is already a crime, but officials believe a new offense — part of a border security bill currently going through Parliament — will give police and prosecutors more powers to disrupt gangs that send migrants on perilous journeys across one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer has said the crime gangs are a threat to global security and should be treated like terror networks.

Since taking office a year ago, Starmer’s center-left Labour Party government has adopted powers to seize the assets of people-smugglers, beefed up U.K. border surveillance and increased law-enforcement cooperation with France and other countries to disrupt the journeys.

Despite that, more than 25,000 people have reached Britain by boat so far this year, an increase of 50% on the same period in 2024. Small boat crossings have become a potent political issue, fueled by pictures of smugglers piling migrants into overcrowded, leaky inflatable boats on the French coast.

Opposition parties say the government’s plans aren’t working — though the government argues the problems built up during 14 years when the Conservative Party was in power,

The Conservatives say Starmer should not have scrapped the previous government’s contentious and expensive plan to send migrants arriving by boat on a one-way trip to Rwanda.

“This is a panicked attempt to look tough after months of doing nothing,” Conservative immigration spokesman Chris Philp said.

The government says it will take time to clear a backlog of applications that has left thousands of migrants stuck in temporary accommodation — often hotels — without the right to work.

Research suggests about 80% of migrants arriving to the UK by small boat used internet platforms during their journey - including to contact agents linked to smuggling gangs.

While it is already illegal to assist illegal immigration, ministers hope the creation of a new offence will give police more powers and disrupt business models.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper is also planning to introduce a fast-track scheme to tackle the asylum backlog, meaning decisions will be made within weeks.

It comes as official figures show more than 25,000 people have arrived on small boats so far in 2025 - a record for this point in the year.

Ms Cooper said it is ""immoral"" for smugglers to sell false promises online, adding: ""These criminals have no issue with leading migrants to life-threatening situations using brazen tactics on social media.

""We are determined to do everything we can to stop them, wherever they operate.""

The new offence prohibiting the online promotion of Channel crossings is set to be included in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill already going through Parliament.

Officials from the National Crime Agency already work with tech giants to remove such posts - with more than 8,000 taken offline last year.

A Preston-based smuggler who was jailed for 17 years had posted videos of migrants thanking him for his help.

Meanwhile, Albanian smugglers have created promotions for £12,000 ""package deals"" which claim to offer accommodation and a job in the UK on arrival.

The Conservatives have described the measures as ""too little, too late"" - and say automatic deportations are the only way to tackle small boat crossings.

Shadow home secretary Chris Philp said: ""Labour still has no clear plan to deter illegal entry, no effective enforcement and no strategy to speed up removals. This is a panicked attempt to look tough after months of doing nothing.""

500,210,Trump administration uses Colorado suspect’s status to push deportation agenda,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/03/boulder-attack-trump-administration-deportation-agenda,2025-06-03T11:00:34Z,The Guardian,GB,illegal alien,"The immigration status of the man who allegedly attacked people with a makeshift flamethrower and other incendiary devices at an event for Israeli hostages in Boulder, Colorado, has become further fodder for the Trump administration’s deportation agenda.

Mohamed Sabry Soliman, a 45-year-old who came to the US in 2022 from Egypt and overstayed his initial tourist visa, according to the US government, allegedly planned his attack on the event specifically to target Zionists, federal authorities said. He shouted “Free Palestine” while carrying out the attack, which the FBI has called an “act of terrorism”, and he was charged on Monday with a federal hate crime.

The attack combines two frequent enemies of the right – anti-Israel speech and actions, and illegal immigration – and is already being used on the right to garner support for more deportations. The response stands in contrast to how the right has reacted to attacks against Palestinians and Muslims in the US and to the conservative response to the war in Gaza. The Trump administration has also used support for Palestinians as an underpinning for deportations among college students.

The Gateway Pundit, a rightwing outlet, is referring to Soliman as “Biden’s Illegal Alien from Egypt”. Stephen Miller, Donald Trump’s deputy chief of staff, said the “terror attack” was committed by an “illegal alien”.

“He was granted a tourist visa by the Biden Administration and then he illegally overstayed that visa. In response, the Biden Administration gave him a work permit,” Miller wrote on X. “Suicidal migration must be fully reversed.”

In a post on Truth Social, Trump blamed the attack on Biden’s “ridiculous Open Border Policy”.

“He must go out under ‘TRUMP’ Policy,” Trump wrote. “Acts of Terrorism will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law. This is yet another example of why we must keep our Borders SECURE, and deport Illegal, Anti-American Radicals from our Homeland.”

The attack occurred in Colorado soon after the Trump administration listed the state and many of its cities and counties, including Boulder, as “sanctuary” jurisdictions that won’t aid law enforcement in deportation activities, though that list was subsequently removed after pushback from places it included. These policies have come up in rightwing coverage of the attack.

For some rightwing commentators, the attack underscored the need for restrictions similar to what Trump attempted in his first term: a Muslim travel ban. (Soliman’s religious affiliation is not clear.)

“Notice how the GOP narrative around Mohamed Soliman is that he is an ‘illegal alien,’” the rightwing commentator Laura Loomer wrote on X in one of several posts calling for a crackdown on “Islamic terrorism”. “We are being gaslit by the GOP to only care about Soliman’s immigration status as opposed to his Islamic ideology which is more of a problem than his immigration status as it relates to the MOTIVE of the terrorist attack.”

It was the second recent attack in which the perpetrator called for a free Palestine, though the first shooting in DC was carried out by a US citizen and did not generate calls to increase deportations. These attacks come amid a rise in support for using violence to achieve political goals, including around the Gaza war.

Studies have shown that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than US-born citizens. The National Institute of Justice has recently taken down a webpage on about how undocumented people are less likely to commit crimes – a note indicates that it is one of many websites and materials being reviewed for compliance with Trump executive orders.

Some studies don’t differentiate between documented and undocumented immigrants when assessing crime rates because the data can be difficult to parse, an NIJ study said. But, this study said, it analyzed Texas criminal records from 2012 to 2018 and found undocumented immigrants “had the lowest offending rates” compared with documented immigrants and US-born citizens, who had the highest rates.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,

The judge, Hannah Dugan, was apprehended in the courthouse where she works in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, a spokesperson for the US Marshals Service confirmed to the Guardian. Kash Patel, the Trump-appointed FBI director, wrote on X that he believed Dugan “intentionally misdirected federal agents away from” Eduardo Flores Ruiz, who he called an “illegal alien”. Agents “chased down” the man and arrested him later, he added.

The case is the latest in a string of attacks by the Trump administration and federal agencies on judges who make decisions that challenge the government’s attempts to overhaul the country’s immigration system or slow its deportations program.

502,210,US congressman sued for wrongly identifying Kansas man as mass shooter,https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/mar/27/kansas-city-parade-shooting-lawsuit,2024-03-27T14:28:09Z,The Guardian,GB,illegal alien,"A Kansas man is suing a US congressman after he was falsely identified as a shooter at the Kansas City Chiefs’ celebration parade.

Denton Loudermill Jr, 48, filed a suit against the Republican US representative Tim Burchett of Tennessee on Monday in the US district court in Kansas City.

Loudermill accused Burchett of calling him an “illegal alien” and “shooter” in a series of social media posts after the 14 February shooting, when at least one person was killed and 21 were injured.

In a viral post, Burchett allegedly shared a photo of Loudermill seated on a curb in handcuffs with the caption: “One of the Kansas City Chiefs victory parade shooters has been identified as an illegal immigrant.”

But Loudermill was not the shooter.

Police had briefly detained Loudermill for “moving too slow” as he attempted to exit the chaotic scene, the lawsuit states. He was later walked a few blocks away from the area and released by police. Loudermill was never arrested or charged for the shooting.

“At no time did [Loudermill] have any connection to or participation in any shooting,” the lawsuit stated.

The 48-year-old was also in the country legally, originally from Olathe, Kansas, a suburb of Kansas City.

Days later, Burchett reshared a screenshot of his original post, clarifying that Loudermill was not “an illegal alien” but still identifying him as “one of the shooters”.

“It has come to my attention that in one of my previous posts, one of the shooters was identified as an illegal alien. This was based on multiple, incorrect news reports stating that. I have removed the post,” Burchett wrote.

Loudermill alleges that he received death threats because of Burchett’s posts. He also experienced “periods of anxiety, agitation, and sleep disruption”, the suit states.

“This is never going to go away for me. This is going to go away for him. I will still have people looking at me and judging me for what he said,” Loudermill told the Washington Post.

Loudermill is now seeking $75,000 in damages for Burchett’s actions.

A spokesperson for Burchett told the Guardian that their office could not provide any comment on pending or active litigation.

503,210,The Biden administration has ended use of the phrase ‘illegal alien’. It’s about time | Moustafa Bayoumi,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/apr/22/the-biden-administration-has-ended-use-of-the-phrase-alien-its-about-time,2021-04-22T10:31:37Z,The Guardian,GB,illegal alien,"This week, the Biden administration fulfilled a promise it made on Joe Biden’s first day in office. Agencies that deal with immigration, such as US Customs and Border Protection, have now been instructed to change their official language practices. Gone are the terms “alien”, “illegal alien” and “assimilation”. Instead, new vocabularies will apply, including the words “noncitizen” for “alien” and “integration” for “assimilation”.

As a former “alien” (who arrived here from the planet “Canada”) and now citizen, here’s what I say to these changes: well, United States, it’s about time! For far too long, so much of the language we use in the US when discussing immigration has been bizarre and dehumanizing. Officials talk about “catch and release”, as if they are chatting about fish when they’re really talking about people’s lives. The term “migrant caravans”, meant to summon images of marauders, is used to describe people searching for refuge together while risking everything in the process. Our southern border is routinely described as being beset by swarms, hordes, swells, or surges, terms that evoke insects or ocean catastrophes – anything, in other words, but people.

The humanity in any immigration policy would be eviscerated by this language. And these dehumanizing terms are deployed so commonly that we may not even notice how much of this damaging rhetoric is deliberate. Usage of the thankfully now-defunct term “illegal aliens” is probably the worst culprit. In 2018, then attorney general Jeff Sessions, whose office was the driving force behind the Trump administration’s unconscionably cruel family separation policy, even told prosecutors not to employ the words “undocumented immigrant” when those words fit the circumstances. Instead, Justice Department lawyers were explicitly instructed to use the term “illegal aliens”.

Sessions’ former boss, Donald Trump, who once said he wanted fewer immigrants to the US from “shithole countries”, routinely and wantonly used the term “illegal alien” whenever he could, including in one of his final speeches, delivered in Alamo, Texas, on 12 January.

These language choices matter. Dehumanize any group of people by language and physical violence often trails not far behind. The 2018 mass killing at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, and the 2019 mass killing in El Paso, Texas, were both motivated by the kind of hatred and fear of immigrants that was frequently stoked by our former president with his flamethrower use of such rhetoric.

When the word “illegal” modifies not an activity but a person, the life of a human being gets wiped out of existence

The Trump administration clearly sought to weaponize the language around immigration as much as possible, but the term “illegal alien” predates Trump, as does organized opposition to the term. The problem with the term is less about its science-fiction-sounding word “alien” (which is actually derived from English common law) and more with stitching it together with the word “illegal”.

When the word “illegal” modifies not an activity but a person, the life of a human being, including all past experiences and every future dream, simply gets wiped out of existence and substituted instead with lawbreaking. The person is no longer a person; they are just a crime. Notably, we don’t use this kind of language for other misdeeds. We talk about the illegal possession of a gun, to take but one example, not about an illegal possessor.

This contradiction has been noted before. US supreme court justice Sonia Sotomayor took notice of this form of dehumanizing language back in 2009. That year, she became the first justice to use the term “undocumented immigrant” rather than “illegal alien” in a court decision. In 2010, a grassroots movement was started called “Drop the I-Word” to get media organizations to stop using the word “illegal” to describe immigrants. In 2013, the Associated Press updated its influential AP Stylebook, abandoning the term “illegal immigrant” as well. “The Stylebook no longer sanctions the use of ‘illegal’ to describe a person,” it explained. “Instead, ‘illegal’ should describe only an action.”

There are other fundamental problems with the way the term “illegal alien” is commonly used today. Pundits and politicians often deploy it to describe people seeking asylum at our borders, but applying for asylum is a completely legal act. Even crossing the border without authorization (or overstaying a visa) is usually charged as a civil and not a criminal infraction. The term, in other words, is almost always used imprecisely.

The dehumanizing term “illegal aliens” has been around since at least the 1950s, but it has never reached the kind of fever pitch that we hear today. The reason for the change cannot be linked to the number of undocumented people in the country, since that number peaked in 2007. Rather, “illegal alien” has increasingly become a term that politicians, anti-immigrant activists, and some government agencies have used in attempts to shape the debate about immigration for their own political purposes.

The Biden administration’s change of the official language used to discuss immigration is a strategically astute way of disarming immigration detractors, and it may even usher in some level of humanity back into the process. But this isn’t enough, of course. Real immigration reform must follow. Paths to citizenship for the millions of undocumented people who are living in the shadows must be made into law. Unaccompanied minors must be afforded the same levels of safety and dignity we would want for our own children. And asylees must be admitted at far higher numbers than currently permitted.

Don’t get me wrong, changing the language is important, but actions will always speak louder than even the best word changes.",GNews,-8.12,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,40.17,"the guardian, The Guardian UK, guardian.co.uk, theguardian.com, Guardian",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-guardian/,https://ground.news/interest/guardian,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/the-guardian-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.9),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,Center,,Center,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Center,theguardian.com,,the guardian,58,United Kingdom,Y,A,The Guardian,
494,150,Oil’s five decades as ruler of the world,https://www.newstatesman.com/the-weekend-interview/2023/10/randall-hansen-oil-yom-kippur-war-modern-world-1973,2023-10-28T07:00:00Z,New Statesman,GB,mass migration,"Randall Hansen has been writing about immigration for 30 years. In his latest book, War, Work and Want, he aims to solve a puzzle: at the end of the 1960s, mass immigration appeared to be coming to an end. Post-colonial migration had been curtailed – Britain had removed the free movement of people from the Commonwealth, and European countries had ended their “guest worker” schemes – while in the US, net migration had been negative for a decade. “You would have thought immigration would have been history, rather than politics.”

And yet for half a century immigration has risen, and is now at the highest point in human history; the latest estimates from the UN put the number of people on the move at 281 million. Immigration was the primary issue in the Brexit referendum, but net migration into the UK last year was more than double that of 2016. Why? Hansen’s thesis is that this huge movement of people can be traced back to a single event – an “economic and ideological force multiplier” – that set the conditions for the modern world. That event was the Opec oil embargo of 1973.

We spoke nearly 50 years to the day after Opec (then known as Oapec, the Organisation of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries), led by Saudi Arabia, cut exports and production to the countries that supported Israel in the Yom Kippur War. Hours before our meeting on 18 October, Iran had recommended that the nations of the Organisation of Islamic Co-operation, led by Saudi Arabia, should embargo oil exports to Israel in response to the Israel-Hamas war.

Hansen’s book convincingly argues that the 1973 embargo was the inciting incident for the events of the past half-century. Arab nations’ use of the “oil weapon” meant Israel’s military victory came at a huge price: inflation and recession across the West, while the Middle East enjoyed “the most successful get-rich-quick scheme in economic history”.

“It halved economic growth in the West and the global north, permanently. We went from 5 per cent [GDP growth per year] to 2.5, and we’ve never gone back.” In every developed economy outside Opec, wages entered a multi-decade stagnation. The postwar boom, funded by cheap energy, was at an end. But Western governments, businesses and consumers did not simply agree to have less. In a materially more expensive world, they reacted by devaluing work. “We rebuilt our standard of living,” Hansen told me, “by destroying the unions and replacing them with cheap, exploited migrant labour.”

The “we” in this thesis is not governments or businesses, but us – the Western consumers who want ever cheaper products and free services. This is not because we’re immoral but because domestic wages have generally been stagnant. The repricing of energy in 1973 – the “great revaluation”, as Hansen calls it – took away the economic growth that had supplied new luxuries in previous decades, and capitalism responded with new efficiencies: goods made in countries with far worse pay and working conditions, and in our own countries “the creation of a class of jobs that only migrants are prepared to do”.

But this is only half the story: the 1973 oil embargo also supplied the migrants to do the work we didn’t want to do. “It flooded the Gulf States and Russia with money, and that reconfigured politics and changed geopolitics in a way that had massive consequences.” Many of the most important events of the past 50 years, Hansen said, were precipitated by the “destabilising, revolution-inducing” power of the great repricing.

In Iran, the oil boom had caused rapid economic and cultural change, allowing Ayatollah Khomeini to topple the Shah in 1979. In the same year, Saddam Hussein formally became Iraq’s leader, while Afghanistan’s natural gas fields and its proximity to the Persian Gulf made it newly valuable to the Soviet Union, which invaded. The new price of energy was an incentive to conflict. In War, Work and Want, Hansen explains how the two Iraq wars, the Syrian Civil War and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine can all be viewed as having proceeded from the embargo of 1973. Oil’s dominance as the source of economic and political power helped to create “an era of refugee labour”, he told me, as tens of millions of people sought relief from conflict and took any work they could get.

In the West, however, the newly affordable flow of workers has had a stabilising effect. Real wages were stagnant, but life became cheaper. Combing through pricing data on trousers, sporting equipment and furniture, Hansen confirmed a pattern: “Any product with a high labour component got much cheaper. So it’s not an automation story. It’s a labour story.” Stylish jeans were affordable not because we were better off but because they were made by Syrians fleeing a murderous regime.

As we were speaking, Opec issued a statement that it would not be pursuing an embargo against Israel. But no embargo is needed: the oil price rose anyway as tensions escalated. This illustrates a grim truth: for autocratic petrostates such as Russia and Saudi Arabia, violence is a more stable floor for prices than the threat of production cuts. In 2022, despite a punishing war, Russia’s current account reached a record high. Chaos pays for itself.

Hansen argues that the West, too, has benefited from post-1973 immigration: our economies have been propped up, our clothes manufactured and our toilets cleaned by people forced to leave their homes. Not that we thank them for it: one of our Prime Minister’s five key objectives is to “stop the boats”. The people who arrived in the UK on small boats last year accounted for less than 4 per cent of total arrivals, but they are more emotive, Hansen said, because they represent “such a flagrant violation of sovereignty and border control”. Politically, to present small boats as the problem makes sense: most voters agree with border control in principle, and such arrivals are easier to address than others, especially as the UK, Hansen pointed out, is “particularly dependent on low-skilled migrants… That’s why Brexit led not to fewer, but to more immigrants, because the country is so structurally dependent on them. They weren’t coming for the weather, or the reasonable house prices.”

The resource curse of the oil economy will not last forever, but while it does, it remains a geopolitical threat. As Russia has shown, and as Iran is now showing, it is within the power of petrostates to push Western countries into deep recession, just as they did in 1973. “When you read the memoirs of [the 1970s leaders] Schmidt and Callaghan and Giscard d’Estaing,” Hansen said, “at the time they were really worried that the Western economy was going to enter a crash from which it never emerged.”

The only way to rob the petrocracies of their power is to end our addiction to the energy they sell, using massive investment programmes such as the US’s Inflation Reduction Act and the EU’s Green Deal. “It’s difficult for non-democracies with massive amounts of oil to make this transition, because that’s the oil curse – it’s just such cheap, easy money. In the absence of liberal democracy, you don’t you don’t have the level of innovation necessary for the transition.”

The risk is that the transition is derailed by the fossil-fuelled populism at which the Conservatives are now grasping or that could return Donald Trump to the White House next year. The conditions are there, said Hansen, for us to repeat our historic mistake: “The early 2020s look very much like the early 1970s. You have an American president who came to power on the back of a great deal of optimism, damaged by the chaotic withdrawal from the Vietnam of our of our age – which is to say the war in Afghanistan. You have a Russian invasion of another sovereign state, that no one predicted, no one expected and horrified the world. And then you have the deployment of an oil embargo by a major oil-exporting state [Russia]. It’s a huge echo.”

508,143,A Texas researcher was held at an airport for over a week. Now he faces deportation.,https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/texas-researcher-was-held-airport-week-now-faces-deportation-rcna222522,2025-08-01T18:03:32Z,NBC News,US,deportation,"SAN FRANCISCO — A researcher at Texas A&M University flying home from abroad was detained for more than a week by immigration authorities at the San Francisco International Airport, sleeping in a chair and living off food sold in the airport, his family and attorneys said Thursday.

It was unclear why Tae Heung ""Will"" Kim, who is a legal permanent resident with a green card, was detained July 21, his attorney Karl Krooth said at a news conference. Kim, who went to South Korea to attend his brother's wedding, is now in removal proceedings to be deported and is being held at an immigration detention facility in Arizona, Krooth said, adding that he has yet to talk to his client.

Customs and Border Protection said in a statement that any green card holder who has a drug offense is in violation of their legal status and can be detained. His attorneys said Kim was charged in 2011 with misdemeanor marijuana possession in Texas, where recreational use is illegal.

His attorneys declined to discuss those charges Thursday. But one attorney told the Washington Post, which first reported on Kim's detention, that he fulfilled a community service requirement and successfully petitioned for nondisclosure to seal the offense from the public record.

Since returning to the White House, President Donald Trump has launched an unprecedented campaign of immigration enforcement that has pushed the limits of executive power and clashed with federal judges trying to restrain him. American citizens, legal permanent residents, visa holders and visitors have been stopped at airports and detained for days. Some have faced deportation for minor infractions.

Kim, 40, has spent most of his life in the U.S., arriving at the age of 5. After helping out in his family's doll-manufacturing business following the death of his father, he recently entered a doctoral program at Texas A&M and is helping to research a vaccine for Lyme disease.

His attorney said holding Kim at the airport denied him his right to due process.

""The airport is not a detention facility. The airport is not in the immigration courtroom. And Customs and Border Protection officers are interrogators, they are not neutral arbiters,"" he said.

Krooth said his client was moved between two small rooms in the daytime at the airport.

""He was moved within what's called secondary inspection at least twice per day from one area where there were no windows,"" Krooth said.

At night he was moved to another room where he slept in a chair, Krooth said. An airport spokesperson said in an email that ""the airport is not notified when CBP denies entry to a passenger,"" referring inquiries to federal officials.

His attorneys were not allowed access and Kim while he was at the airport and he was given only one phone call and periodic texts with his brother. There has been no communication with Kim since he's been transferred to Arizona, Krooth said.

Kim's mother, Yehoon ""Sharon"" Lee, told reporters Thursday through an interpreter that her son has asthma and she worries about him getting proper medical care in detention.

Lee told the Washington Post that she and her husband entered the U.S. on business visas in the 1980s, and by the time they became naturalized citizens, Kim was too old to get automatic citizenship.",GNews,-5.61,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,42.76,"nbc news, NBC, nbcnews.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Comcast,1940,-1.8,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,nbcnews.com,,nbc news,24,USA,,,,
509,35,Judge pauses expedited deportations of migrants granted humanitarian parole,https://edition.cnn.com/2025/08/01/politics/deportation-migrants-humanitarian-parole,2025-08-01T17:16:06Z,Cable News Network,US,deportation,"Immigration Donald Trump See all topics Follow

A federal judge on Friday paused the Trump administration’s efforts to fast-track the deportation of migrants who legally entered the United States through humanitarian parole programs, marking a win for immigrant rights groups who argued the policy was illegal and dangerous.

The ruling temporarily blocks the government from deporting individuals who were granted parole at ports of entry and were later detained — often without warning and in some cases after appearing at immigration courts — despite having valid documents, jobs or other pending forms of relief.

“In a world of bad options, they played by the rules,” wrote Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of former President Joe Biden. “Now, the Government has not only closed off those pathways for new arrivals but changed the game for parolees already here.”

“This case’s underlying question … asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,” Cobb wrote. “Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that … may look to them more and more like the countries from which they tried to escape?”

In her opinion, Cobb ruled that the policy likely violates the expedited removal statute and is “arbitrary and capricious” under administrative law. The pause will remain in effect while the lawsuit proceeds.

The formal order pauses enforcement of three Trump-era directives: a Homeland Security memo from January, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement directive from February and the March termination of parole programs for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans. Cobb’s ruling applies specifically to people who were previously granted parole at ports of entry.

This case marks one of the first major court challenges to immigration policy under President Donald Trump’s second term and is widely seen as a bellwether for how federal courts will interpret executive power following the Supreme Court’s decision in Trump v. CASA, which narrowed the scope of nationwide injunctions.

At the heart of the lawsuit is the administration’s decision to apply “expedited removal” — a fast-track deportation process normally used for recent border crossers — to migrants who entered legally and were complying with government instructions. Under new guidance issued this spring, ICE agents began detaining parolees outside courtrooms and at checkpoints, often without giving them access to attorneys.

Advocates warned the policy could put more than 2 million people at risk of summary deportation, including many who came to the US fleeing persecution and were pursuing legal pathways to stay.

The challengers — led by Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights (CHIRLA), CASA, and UndocuBlack — argued that DHS is violating the Immigration and Nationality Act by treating legally paroled migrants as if they had entered unlawfully. Their suit also raises due process concerns, saying the new policy endangers vulnerable communities without giving them a chance to be heard.

Hillary Li, an attorney representing the challengers, said the groups “are deeply committed to protecting our communities from the harms of expedited removal,” adding they are “grateful the court recognized that this practice is unlawful.”

The case is part of a broader legal fight over how far the executive branch can go in dismantling Biden-era immigration and parole policies.",GNews,-6.23,,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnn-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.09,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/,https://ground.news/interest/cnn,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.7),USA,,TV Station/Website,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Turner Broadcasting System,1980,-1.3,Lean Left,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,edition.cnn.com,,cable news network,57,USA,Y,F,CNN,

WASHINGTON (AP) — The agency responsible for carrying out President Donald Trump’s mass deportations is launching a recruiting campaign to entice “brave and heroic Americans” to serve as new deportation officers, lawyers and investigators as the government gears up for a major expansion of immigration enforcement thanks to a recent infusion of money from Congress. The icing on the cake: a promise of up to $50,000 in signing bonuses.

The U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement campaign, which rolled out late Tuesday, recalls recruiting posters from World War II with images of Uncle Sam and the words “AMERICA NEEDS YOU.” There also are photos of Trump and top homeland security officials with the words “DEFEND THE HOMELAND” across the images.

“Your country is calling you to serve at ICE,” said Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem in a news release. “This is a defining moment in our nation’s history. Your skills, your experience, and your courage have never been more essential. Together, we must defend the homeland.”

In addition to appealing to prospective applicants’ patriotic fervor, Homeland Security is making a pocketbook pitch. The agency is promising up to $50,000 in signing bonuses, the potential for lots of overtime for deportation officers and other benefits such as loan repayment or forgiveness options.

Lots of money is coming to ICE

All of this is made possible by a big infusion of money to ICE.

The package of tax breaks and spending cuts that Trump signed into law this month includes about $170 billion for border security and immigration enforcement, spread out over five years.

ICE is set to get $76.5 billion, nearly 10 times its current annual budget. Some $45 billion will go toward increasing detention capacity. Nearly $30 billion is for hiring 10,000 more staff so the agency can meet its goal of 1 million annual deportations.

New hires include deportation officers responsible for tracking down, arresting and removing people who the administration determines no longer have the right to remain in the United States.

Under the Republican president, those officers are high-profile roles — making arrests at immigration courts, in the streets and at businesses. They often are criticized by immigration activists and Democratic lawmakers for wearing masks while carrying out their duties.

On the recruitment webpage, the link to learn more about applying to be a deportation officer shows a photo of an armored vehicle rolling down a street with officers in military gear hanging onto the sides of the vehicle.

The government is also seeking criminal investigators and lawyers who will prosecute immigration cases.

The agency said it will advertise at college campuses, job fairs and law enforcement networks, starting this week. But the recruiting drive has raised concerns about what happens if the agency grows too fast.

Staffing is a long-standing challenge

ICE staffing has long been an issue, said Jason Houser, a former agency chief of staff during the Biden administration.

At the beginning of the Trump administration there were roughly 6,000 officers within ICE tasked with monitoring noncitizens in the country, then finding and removing those not eligible to stay.

Those staffing numbers remained largely static over the years even as the caseload ballooned. During the Biden administration, when the number of people arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border skyrocketed, ICE workers were often pulled from their regular duties to go to the border.

“ICE does need more employees to handle the volume of what they’re handling,” Houser said.

But he is concerned about whether the rush to increase staffing could mean lower standards for recruits and training.

The Border Patrol’s rapid expansion during the early 2000s serves as a cautionary tale. To meet hiring goals, training and hiring standards were changed. Arrests for employee misconduct rose.

“If they start waiving requirements there like they did for Border Patrol, you’re going have an exponential increase in officers that are shown the door after three years because there’s some issue,” he said. At the same time, Houser noted the Department of Homeland Security has dismantled some of the key agencies that have provided some level of oversight over ICE and other DHS arms.

Houser estimated it would take three to four years to actually hire and train that number of new ICE staffers. In the meantime, he worries that ICE will rely on private contractors, National Guard troops and other federal law enforcement officers to meet the administration’s goal of 3,000 arrests a day.

$50,000 bonus is on the high end

Chuck Wexler is the executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum which studies policing issues. He said police departments across the country have struggled to maintain staffing since the pandemic and the fallout from the death of George Floyd, and are often offering hiring bonuses as a result. He’s seen bonus offers ranging from $10,000 to as much as $60,000 or $70,000 for departments on the West Coast.

But he said the $50,000 topline bonus that DHS is offering is definitely on the high end, and Homeland Security’s hiring spree could end up having repercussions on police departments across the country if their officers try to get hired by ICE.

“The environment for hiring law enforcement has never been more competitive,” he said. “This could conceivably impact state and local agencies. You could have someone leaving a police department to get a $50,000 signing bonus with DHS.”

18 July 2025 Share Save Rob England Data Journalist, BBC Verify Jack Fenwick Political correspondent Share Save

EPA

The government spent nearly a third less on hotels to house asylum seekers between April 2024 and March 2025, according to newly published figures. The Home Office's annual accounts show £2.1bn was spent on hotel accommodation - an average of about £5.77m per day, down from £3bn or £8.3m per day, the previous year. Data obtained by BBC Verify shows the saving has been driven by a reduction in the average nightly cost per person housed, after a government move to use cheaper forms of accommodation and room sharing. But Dr Peter Walsh, from the Migration Observatory think tank at Oxford University, warned that the surge in small boat crossings seen since March could lead to a renewed reliance on hotels.

""I don't think hotels are going away anytime soon based on current trends,"" he said. Hotel accommodation is used when there is no other housing available for asylum seekers, and the government has committed to stop using asylum hotels by the end of this Parliament. There were 32,345 people in asylum hotels at the end of March 2025, up from 29,585 people at the end of June last year, but lower than the total in December.

A senior Home Office source said one of the main factors behind the saving was moving some asylum seekers from hotels into other types of cheaper accommodation. They said the department had prioritised moving families and children into regular housing so they were not living in hotels for long periods of time. BBC News understands the majority of people moved out of hotels are now living in local housing, or houses in multiple occupation (HMOs), a type of rented accommodation where at least three individuals share the use of a bathroom and kitchen. Most of these properties have been acquired through the government's contracts with Serco, one of the three companies responsible for asylum accommodation. Some savings have also been made by renegotiating elements of those contracts, which were originally signed by the previous Conservative government. Officials have previously told MPs that greater room-sharing in hotels has helped reduce the number of sites and per head costs over the past financial year. It is not clear how many people usually share a room, but Home Office minister Angela Eagle has previously said ""people can double up or treble up"" if rooms are big enough. The Home Office accounts suggest 273 hotels were in use in March 2024 but that number has now fallen by 71. The average nightly cost per person fell from £162.16 in March 2023 to £118.87 by March 2025, according to BBC Verify's analysis of official data obtained through a Freedom of Information request.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,
512,8,Refugee and migrant crossings to UK hit record high by end of July,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/31/refugee-and-migrant-crossings-to-uk-hit-record-high-by-end-of-july,2025-07-31T18:51:41Z,Al Jazeera English,US,channel crossings,"More than 25,000 people have crossed the Engilsh Channel to the UK in 2025, the highest total this early in the year.

More than 25,000 people have crossed the English Channel into the United Kingdom so far this year, marking the fastest pace of arrivals since records began in 2018 and piling pressure on the UK’s Labour government as anti-immigration sentiment is stoked by the political right wing.

Figures released on Thursday show that nearly 900 refugees and migrants made the crossing in 13 small boats on Wednesday alone, bringing the total number of arrivals in 2025 to 25,436. It’s a perilous journey that has resulted in dozens of deaths over the years.

The milestone is likely to intensify political scrutiny over Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s handling of undocumented migration. His government has pledged tougher action on smuggling networks, with Starmer vowing to “smash the gangs” responsible for transporting people across the Channel.

Opposition politicians have seized on the latest numbers to criticise Labour’s approach.

“Almost 900 people crossed the Channel yesterday, meaning 25,000 people, mainly young men, have crossed the Channel this year. [And] 2025 is the worst year on record so far, and the Labour Government are doing nothing to stop the crossings,” said Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp.

He added: “Their 17 in, one out deal with France will not even make a dent – it would take 10 years for [Home Secretary] Yvette Cooper to deport the illegal immigrants that have arrived since the start of this year alone under her so-called deal, which still hasn’t started.”

Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron announced “one in, one out” returns of asylum seekers earlier this month. The pilot programme sets out that for every person returned, a different individual would be allowed “to come here via a safe route: controlled and legal, subject to strict security checks and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally”, Starmer said at the time.

Philp also reiterated his party’s proposal to immediately detain and deport new arrivals, warning that continued legal challenges under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) could force a Conservative government to consider withdrawing from it, a threat they have often made in and around the Brexit years when the party was in government.

Radical right Reform UK leader Nigel Farage echoed those criticisms, writing on social media: “898 illegals crossed the English Channel yesterday. This means more hotels, more costs and more people who should not be here. The public have had ENOUGH!”

A series of violent far-right demonstrations have been held recently outside a hotel housing asylum seekers in Epping, north of London.

Meanwhile, United States President Donald Trump, who campaigned on a hardline anti-immigration platform and has been executing it during his second term with raids and deportations of immigrants, recently praised the UK government’s efforts, saying it was “doing a fantastic thing” by addressing the issue, though he admitted knowing “nothing about the boats”.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

UN agencies and aid organisations cite Israeli restrictions, safety issues and the establishment of a US- and Israeli-backed mechanism that has sidelined the humanitarian system in place.

Israel says international organisations have failed, and that the previous UN-led system had allowed Hamas militants to loot aid trucks.

On the ground, meanwhile, more than 100 aid and human rights groups warned this week that ""mass starvation"" was spreading.

- GHF: few sites, deadly incidents -

Israel's chosen aid distributor, the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), began operations on May 26 after a more than two-month total aid blockade.

Now the main channel for distributing food to Gaza's more than two million people, GHF has faced chaos and deadly violence at its few distribution points.

The United Nations and aid groups have refused to work with GHF, saying it was created to serve Israeli military interests.

""They are not a humanitarian organisation... You don't deliver humanitarian aid in areas that have been completely flattened and militarised,"" said Arwa Damon, founder of INARA, a US-based NGO offering medical and mental health support to children.

She noted the GHF's site locations -- along two military corridors in southern and central Gaza -- rather than being spread out across the territory.

With only four GHG sites and huge crowds trying to reach them, there have been repeated reports of deadly fire near them.

According to UN figures, Israeli forces have killed some 800 Palestinian aid-seekers near GHF sites since late May.

Israel has rejected calls to restore the UN-led system, citing concerns that Hamas looted trucks and resold aid meant to be distributed free of charge.

- Aid organisations sidelined -

International aid groups say vast quantities of aid are stockpiled outside Gaza but require Israeli military clearance to enter.

Inside Gaza, coordination with the military is also essential, as fighting and air strikes rage on.

Damon accused Israel of preventing aid delivery by refusing to coordinate with NGOs to grant safe passage through combat zones.

""Getting that coordination approved is incredibly challenging,"" she told AFP.

""Not to mention Israel's lack of willingness to provide humanitarian organisations with a safe route to be able to ensure a secure pickup.""

The UN agency for Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, said on Wednesday it had ""thousands of trucks in neighbouring countries waiting to enter Gaza –- banned by Israeli authorities from entering since March"".

- 'Encountered death' for flour -

Israel screens all goods entering Gaza, but COGAT, the Israeli defence ministry body overseeing civil affairs in the Palestinian territories, denies limiting the number of humanitarian trucks.

On Thursday it said ""around 70 food trucks were unloaded at aid crossings, and over 150 were collected by the UN and international organisations from the Gazan side"".

But more than 800 trucks remained uncollected, and Israel's military posted footage online of hundreds of trucks loaded with food aid ""sitting idle inside Gaza"".

UN agencies and international NGOs reject Israeli claims that they lack the capacity to distribute food.

They note that aid was distributed effectively in the past, including during the last ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war that ended in March.

In Khan Yunis, in Gaza's south, resident Yousef Abu Shehla said this week he had ""encountered death"" to get his hands on a bag of flour for his family.

""We shall feed our children even if we die,"" he told AFP.

The individuals and entities targeted on Wednesday include a small boat supplier in Asia and gang leaders based in the Balkans and North Africa. “Middlemen” putting cash through the hawala money transfer system in the Middle East, which is used in payments linked to Channel crossings, are also targeted.

It is unclear how effective the new sanctions regime will be, since British authorities can only freeze assets that are in the UK, and most of the smugglers are based elsewhere.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Wednesday that it was a “landmark moment in the government’s work to tackle organised immigration crime [and] reduce irregular migration to the UK”.

“From Europe to Asia, we are taking the fight to the people smugglers who enable irregular migration, targeting them wherever they are in the world and making them pay for their actions,” he added.

The move follows legislation being introduced under the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill to ramp up enforcement powers for police forces and partners to investigate and prosecute people smugglers.

As part of the new sanctions regime, which was introduced two days ago, the government can now freeze assets, impose travel bans and block access to the country’s financial system for individuals and entities involved in enabling irregular migration, without relying on criminal or counterterrorism laws.

Albanian Bledar Lala, leader of the Belgian operations of an organised smuggling group, and a company in China that advertised small boats for people smuggling on an online marketplace are among those sanctioned.

The number of refugees and migrants arriving on England’s southern coast via small boats from northern France is a major political issue for Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s Labour government, which has seen the far-right Reform UK party make significant political gains with a hardline anti-immigration platform.

Starmer recently agreed to migration deals with France and Germany.

Earlier this month, Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron agreed to a “one in, one out” deal in which refugees and migrants arriving by small boats would be returned to France in exchange for an equal number of migrants being able to come to the UK from France via a new legal route, which would be fully documented and subject to strict security checks.

Last week, Germany and the UK signed a historic defence treaty, in which Berlin committed to making facilitating the smuggling of refugees and migrants to the UK a criminal offence. The law change, which is expected to be passed by the end of the year, will give German authorities more powers to investigate and take action against warehouses and storage facilities used by smugglers to conceal small boats for Channel crossings.

Some 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in 2024, and more than 22,000 so far in 2025 – an increase of about 50 percent from the same period last year.

Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Thursday a pilot programme to return migrants arriving in small boats.

Macron added that Britain's departure from the European Union meant the lack of formal agreements with the EU on migration was actually encouraging people to make those crossings over the Channel.

""The current situation is actually giving an incentive to make the crossing. And this is therefore the exact opposite of what Brexit had proposed and promised,"" said Macron on Thursday.

""The thing is, the British people were sold a lie, which was that they were told the problem was Europe but by creating this legal void, the problem has become Brexit.""

Official UK data published earlier this month showed nearly 20,000 asylum seekers had arrived in Britain on small boats so far in 2025, marking a record high for the first six months of the year.

A new record was set as over 20,000 migrants crossed the English Channel by July 1 – nearly two months earlier than in 2024 – marking a 50 percent year-on-year increase.

On July 1 alone, nearly 200 additional migrants arrived, with multiple boats still en route, pushing the total towards 20,250 and putting 2025 on track to surpass all previous records.

The surge coincides with Prime Minister Keir Starmer's first year in office; critics say Labor has failed to deliver on its pledge to dismantle smuggling networks and deter crossings.

Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp has demanded a return to offshore removals, arguing only strict deterrents can curb illegal arrivals.

A proposed U.K.-France returns agreement is already drawing criticism from several EU countries, which warn the bilateral plan could strain EU migration policy and shift burdens to southern states.

A new record has been set in Britain's ongoing migrant crisis, as the number of people crossing the English Channel by small boat surpassed 20,000 in the early hours of July 1 – reaching the milestone nearly two months earlier than last year.

According to the official data of the government, there were 19,983 arrivals by Monday night, June 30, with the threshold broken when a boat carrying around 60 migrants landed on the Kent coastline at approximately 2:00 a.m. the next day. (Related: Boatloads of illegal migrants making their way into Europe via Spain.)

By 8 a.m., two more Border Force ships, Defender and Ranger, had arrived in the harbor with an additional 71 migrants. At least three more small boats were reported to be en route across the Channel as of this morning, raising the likelihood that the total could push this year's count beyond 20,250.

The pace of crossings this year marks a sharp acceleration in the crisis.

Compared to 2024, when the 20,000 mark was not reached until Aug. 29, this year's figures represent a 50 percent increase. The previous record year, 2022, which saw a surge in crossings after Wuhan coronavirus (COVID-19) travel restrictions were lifted, is now on track to be eclipsed well before the end of 2025.

Starmer faces migrant surge and EU backlash over France deal

The surge comes as the Labour government, led by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, marks its first anniversary in office. Starmer campaigned on a promise to ""smash"" the cross-Channel smuggling operations fueling the migrant flow, but critics argue that little has changed.

""One year into Labor's Government and the boats haven't stopped – they've multiplied,"" Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said. ""Labour tore up our deterrent and replaced it with fantasy. This is the worst year on record and it's become a free-for-all.""

Philp called for a more hardline approach, including removing all illegal arrivals to countries outside of Europe, a model previously attempted under the Conservative government's stalled Rwanda plan.

""We need a removal deterrent so every single illegal immigrant who arrives is removed to a location outside Europe. The crossings will then rapidly stop. People are furious and rightly so. Under new leadership, only the Conservatives have a credible plan to stop the crossings, restore control and end the chaos,"" Philp added.

Moreover, the long-anticipated bilateral deal between France and the U.K. on illegal immigration is already meeting resistance from within Europe. Several EU member states, including Italy, Spain, Greece, Malta and Cyprus, have formally objected to the plan, warning it could destabilize EU migration policy and shift responsibility for irregular migration back onto frontline states.

""We take note – with a degree of surprise – of the reported intention of France to sign a bilateral readmission arrangement. If confirmed, such an initiative raises serious concerns for us, both procedurally and in terms of potential implications for other member states, particularly those of first entry,"" opposing members of the bloc wrote in a strongly worded letter to the European Commission.

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have agreed on the need for a “new deterrent” to stop refugee and migrant crossings across the English Channel.

“The leaders agreed tackling the threat of irregular migration and small boat crossings is a shared priority that requires shared solutions,” a British readout of Wednesday’s meeting at 10 Downing Street said. “The two leaders agreed on the need to go further and make progress on new and innovative solutions, including a new deterrent to break the business model of these gangs.”

Macron is on a three-day state visit to the United Kingdom which has moved from the genteel royal pomp and ceremony to the harder edges of the political realm as his hosts press for new measures to curb undocumented immigration.

The number of refugees and migrants arriving on England’s southern coast via small boats from northern France is a major political issue for the Labour government, which has seen the far-right Reform UK party make significant political gains with a hardline anti-immigration platform.

The talks come on Macron’s second day of his visit to the UK, which began with a warm welcome from King Charles III and members of the royal family and a lavish banquet at Windsor Castle.

It’s the first state visit by a French president to the UK since Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008 and the first by a European Union head of state since Brexit was made official in 2020. Macron’s trip came at the invitation of King Charles III.

‘One in-one out’ deal not favoured by EU

Macron addressed the British parliament on Tuesday, promising to deliver on measures to cut the number of people crossing the English Channel, describing the issue as a “burden” to both countries. He also said that France and the UK had a “shared responsibility to address irregular migration with humanity, solidarity and fairness”.

Britain hopes to strike a “one in, one out” deal to send small boat refugees and migrants back to the continent, in exchange for the UK accepting asylum seekers in Europe who have a British link, the domestic Press Association news agency reported.

France has previously refused to sign such an agreement, saying the UK should negotiate an arrangement with all European Union countries.

“This deal is far from being finished because there is a lot of opposition from certain European nations, which are usually the port of entry for people seeking to come to Europe, places like Spain, Malta, Italy, Greece and Cyprus,” said Al Jazeera’s Milena Veselinovic, reporting from London.

“That is because under EU law, in theory, France could just move on the people they receive from Britain and onto those countries, the first port of entry countries, to claim asylum there. So Keir Starmer doesn’t only need to convince President Macron of this deal, but he also has quite significant stumbling blocks when it comes to convincing other European nations.”

In parliament Nigel Farage, leader of Reform UK, challenged Starmer to “say to the French president we will not accept undocumented males across the English Channel”.

There has been increasing frustration in the UK over funding for France to prevent refugees and migrants setting off and a law that prevents police intercepting boats while in the water close to shore.

“We will only provide funding that delivers for our priorities,” Starmer told parliament, adding that Britain had persuaded the French “to review their laws and tactics on the north coast to take more effective action”.

After he took power a year ago, Starmer promised to “smash the gangs”, getting thousands of people onto the small boats – only to see numbers rise to record levels.

More than 21,000 people have crossed from northern France to southeast England in basic vessels this year, on a perilous journey.

The Macrons began the second day of their visit by paying their respects at the tomb of the late Queen Elizabeth II at Windsor’s St George’s Chapel.

Macron then discussed biodiversity issues with the king during a stroll in the castle grounds before he bade farewell to his host and headed to central London.

At Tuesday evening’s banquet, Charles used a speech to about 160 guests – including royals, Starmer and music icons Elton John and Mick Jagger – to warn that the two nations’ alliance was as crucial as ever amid a “multitude of complex threats”.

Macron had also said in his address to parliament that “Britain and France were too dependent on the US and China, and that they really need to take joint decisions on defence and security even though Britain has left the European Union, as geographically it is part of Europe,” said Veselinovic.

Charles concluded by toasting a new UK-France “entente… no longer just cordiale, but now amicale”, prompting Macron to laud “this entente amicale that unites our two fraternal peoples in an unwavering alliance”.

UK and France agree on need for new migration boat crossing ‘deterrent’

British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron have reached an agreement on a pilot programme to return migrants and refugees arriving in small boats, in a scheme to curb crossings over the English Channel.

In a joint press conference on Thursday, Starmer said people arriving in the United Kingdom on small boats will “be detained and returned to France in short order”.

The British leader added that for every migrant returned, a different individual would be allowed “to come here via a safe route: controlled and legal, subject to strict security checks and only open to those who have not tried to enter the UK illegally”.

Moreover, Macron, referencing Britain’s exit from the European Union in 2020, said the decision had led to the country having less control over its border, a contrary reality to what defenders of the decision said would happen.

The announcement caps Macron’s three-day state visit to the UK, with Starmer intent on the need for a “new deterrent” to crack down on undocumented migration as support for the far-right anti-immigrant Reform UK party soars.

The policy, which is similar to a scheme used by the European Union and Turkiye, carries risks for Macron since his right-wing political critics may question why he has agreed to take back refugees and migrants wanting to live in Britain.

Sitting next to Macron at his Downing Street office ahead of Thursday’s meeting, Starmer said the situation “cannot go on as it is”.

“We’re bringing new tactics into play and a new level of intent to tackle illegal migration and break the business model of a criminal gang,” he said.

Macron said the two countries “shared the same resolve to fight against illegal criminal gangs, with strong coordination with other EU states”.

The scheme, which has led to “serious concerns” among some other European nations, could initially involve about 50 people a week, French daily Le Monde reported. That number tallies with UK media reports of 2,600 a year.

It would be scaled up later if a pilot scheme demonstrated “proof of concept”, according to The Times, quoting a UK government source.

More than 21,000 people have arrived on small boats this year – a record number. On Wednesday, Starmer’s office said he had told Macron that undocumented workers were increasingly being arrested to deter them from coming to Britain for jobs.

Ukraine and Palestine

Macron’s visit, which has been big on ceremony, including a carriage procession to Windsor Castle with King Charles and a lavish state banquet, saw the French leader discuss other thorny issues with his UK counterpart, including Gaza and Ukraine.

The leaders pledged to order more Storm Shadow cruise missiles, now used in Ukraine, and signed an agreement to deepen their nuclear cooperation, which will say for the first time that the respective deterrents of both countries can be coordinated.

Starmer and Macron will also on Thursday dial into a meeting of the so-called “coalition of the willing” on Ukraine, a group of countries that could potentially deploy peacekeeping forces to the country.

Co-chairing the meeting, Starmer said a new “coordination hub” to act as headquarters for the group had been opened in Kyiv.

Starmer added that they were “finalising command and control structures” for the 30-nation grouping.

Moreover, during the press conference, Macron called for a joint UK-France recognition of a Palestinian state, adding that it was the “only hope for peace” in the region, as Israel’s war on Gaza, which has so far killed at least 57,762 people since October 2023, continues.

The United Kingdom and Germany have signed their first bilateral treaty since World War II, pledging to deepen cooperation on defence at a time of growing threats to Europe.

The Kensington Treaty, signed by UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz on Thursday, includes clauses on “mutual assistance” in case of attack and on “joint export campaigns” to drum up external orders for military hardware such as fighter jets that the countries produce together.

Speaking after the signing ceremony at London’s Victoria and Albert Museum, Merz was cited by the BBC as saying that defence is the thread running through the treaty, showing that Germany and the UK are “really on the way to a new chapter” following the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union in 2020.

“We see the scale of the challenges our continent faces today, and we intend to meet them head on,” Starmer said at the press conference.

It was unclear what practical impact the promise in the treaty to “assist one another, including by military means, in case of an armed attack on the other” would have, since both countries are NATO members and bound by the alliance’s mutual defence pact.

Merz’s visit to London followed a three-day state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron, during which France and the UK pledged to coordinate their nuclear deterrents, signalling tighter cooperation between Europe’s top three powers as doubts persist over US support for the continent amid Russia’s ongoing offensive in Ukraine.

While Germany does not have nuclear weapons, the treaty says the countries will “maintain a close dialogue on defence issues of mutual interest … including on nuclear issues”.

Merz and Starmer also discussed ways of boosting European support for Ukraine, following United States President Donald Trump’s announcement of a plan to bolster Kyiv’s stockpile by selling US weapons to NATO allies who would, in turn, send arms to Kyiv.

Starmer said that a plan was in place in the event of a ceasefire in Ukraine, saying the first step was to get Russian President Vladimir Putin “to the table for an unconditional ceasefire”, according to the BBC.

The so-called “coalition of the willing“, a group of countries led by France and the UK and including Germany, has been discussing the potential deployment of peacekeeping forces to Ukraine to police any future peace agreement with Russia.

The return to power of Trump, who has long been sceptical of US intervention on behalf of historic allies, has made Western European powers more focused on how to defend their own continent, particularly in light of Russia’s ongoing invasion of Ukraine, and the belief that the US may no longer be the transatlantic partner it once was.

Beyond defence, the treaty also includes an agreement to jointly combat irregular migration, part of Starmer’s push to reduce the number of asylum seekers arriving in the UK to try to counter the rise of the hard-right Reform UK party.

Starmer said the treaty showed the two countries “mean business” when it comes to disrupting the arrival of refugees and migrants, and thanked Merz for a new law giving security forces powers to investigate storage facilities used by smugglers to conceal small boats making the crossings over the English Channel.

PA Media This group of migrants were brought ashore to Dover on Wednesday

More than 25,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel so far in 2025, according to official figures. The Home Office said 898 people in 13 boats were brought ashore in Dover on Wednesday, bringing the annual total to 25,436. The 25,000 mark has been passed much earlier this year than in previous years - in the record year of 2022 is was not passed until 27 August. It comes as ministers continue to grapple with the challenge of cracking down on people-smuggling gangs.

Chris Philp MP, shadow home secretary, called it a ""national emergency"", and accused Labour of ""doing nothing"" to stop the crossings.

The government has said it is sharing intelligence and strengthening cross-border cooperation with France to ""smash"" people-smuggling gangs. On Thursday the National Crime Agency announced it had worked with Bulgarian authorities to seize 25 small boats intended for use in the Channel.

PA Media 2025 is the first year in which more than 25,000 migrants have made the crossing before the end of July

In the whole of 2020 there were 8,461 crossings, while in 2019 that number was 1,835. In 2018, there were 297 people recorded making the journey, although figures were only published from 3 November. The annual total for 2025 hit 10,000 at the end of April, and 20,000 by the end of June. The jump in arrivals this year has coincided with a rise in the number of people making the journey in a single craft. The average for 2025 is currently running at 59 people per boat - up from 49 in 2023.

What is the government doing?

A Home Office spokesperson said: ""We all want to end dangerous small boat crossings, which threaten lives and undermine our border security. ""The people-smuggling gangs do not care if the vulnerable people they exploit live or die, as long as they pay and we will stop at nothing to dismantle their business models and bring them to justice. ""That is why this government has put together a serious plan to take down these networks at every stage. Campaigners have long argued the government should introduce ""more safe and legal routes"" to help reduce small boat crossings by making smugglers ""redundant"".

The France return deal

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and the French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this month agreed to a pilot scheme in which some migrants who crossed the channel would be detained and returned to France. In exchange, others would be allowed to come into the UK from France via a legal and controlled route. The idea is to deter migrants from making the crossing. Shadow home secretary Mr Philp claimed the deal with France ""will not even make a dent"". French police have also been changing their tactics. They deliberately punctured a boat in July as it was leaving the beach because it was dangerously overcrowded.

PA Media

More than 25,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel since the start of the year, official figures show. A deal was struck earlier in July between UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron to send some migrants who arrive on small boats back to France. For every migrant returned, France would send an asylum seeker to the UK - potentially one with a family connection to Britain.

How many people cross the Channel in small boats?

As of 30 July, 25,436 migrants had crossed the Channel in small boats in 2025. It is the first time the 25,000 threshold has been reached in July since records began in 2018. In previous years, the earliest date this had happened was 27 August, in 2022.

In 2024 as a whole, nearly 37,000 people were detected making the crossing - 25% more than in 2023. The highest yearly total was recorded in 2022, when 45,755 people arrived. More than 170,000 people have arrived in small boats since figures were first recorded in 2018.

What is the government doing to reduce small boat crossings?

PA Media

The government has also toughened up rules to make it almost impossible for anyone who arrives in the UK on a small boat to become a British citizen. Previously, refugees who entered this way could apply for UK citizenship after 10 years. The Refugee Council estimates at least 71,000 people will be affected. Any offender sentenced to more than a year in prison can currently be refused asylum and deported under the Refugee Convention. The government wants to extend this to include any asylum seeker convicted of sexual offences. Ministers are also spending £150m to establish a new Border Security Command, to lead on efforts to tackle the issue. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp blamed the recent increase in crossings on Labour ""tearing up"" the Conservatives' plan to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda. ""This is the worst year on record, and it's become a free-for-all,"" he added. Is the government meeting its pledges on illegal immigration and asylum?

How many people die crossing the Channel?

The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency, tracks the number of people who die attempting to cross the Channel. Its figures include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or because of medical issues. The IOM estimates that at least 82 migrants died in 2024, making it the deadliest year on record. At the end of June it said that at least 18 people had died on this route in 2025. That takes the total number of migrants who have lost their lives since 2018 to 247. The Refugee Council has said that the dangers of crossings have increased, with more people crammed into less seaworthy boats. Man dies crossing English Channel

Who is crossing the Channel in small boats?

Afghans were the top nationality arriving by small boat in the year to March 2025, according to Home Office figures. Syrians made up the second largest group, followed by people from Iran, Vietnam and Eritrea. These five nationalities accounted for 61% of all arrivals. In 2024, almost one third of the 108,000 people who claimed asylum in the UK arrived on a small boat. The Home Office can remove people with no legal right to stay in the UK, or refuse to let them enter. Between 2018 and December 2024, 4,995 people who came to the UK in small boats were returned to their home country - about 3% of the total. Smuggler reveals operation to help Vietnamese reach UK

527,142,Border security works: Illegal crossings hit RECORD LOW for second straight month – NaturalNews.com,https://www.naturalnews.com/2025-07-20-illegal-crossings-record-low-second-straight-month.html,2025-07-20T06:00:00Z,Naturalnews.com,US,channel crossings,"Border security works: Illegal crossings hit RECORD LOW for second straight month

Illegal border crossings hit a record low for the second straight month, with only 25,228 nationwide encounters in June – the lowest ever recorded. Apprehensions also dropped sharply, including a single-day low of 136 arrests.

President Donald Trump's executive orders – expanding barriers, prosecuting unlawful entrants and targeting cartels – have drastically reduced crossings. Parole-style releases of migrants dropped to zero, compared to 27,766 earlier in 2024.

The U.S. military was deployed to secure federal borderlands, closing smuggling loopholes. Combined with aggressive interior enforcement, this has deterred illegal entries before migrants reach U.S. soil.

As border crossings decline, drug seizures (methamphetamine up 102 percent, fentanyl up three percent) have surged, indicating cartels are adapting tactics. Authorities emphasize continued vigilance to dismantle smuggling networks.

Border communities report reduced strain on resources, but assaults on ICE agents have spiked (830 percent increase). Despite Democratic opposition (e.g., the VISIBLE Act), enforcement policies show undeniable success in restoring order.

For the second consecutive month, illegal border crossings have reached an all-time low – marking a dramatic shift in U.S. immigration enforcement under President Donald Trump's renewed leadership.

According to new data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP), June 2025 saw only 25,228 nationwide encounters – the lowest monthly total ever recorded. Apprehensions also hit a historic low with just 8,024 arrests, including a mere 136 in a single day. These figures reflect a stark reversal from the chaos of the Biden era, where millions surged across the border unchecked.

The numbers tell a clear story: Enforcement works. In June, illegal crossings at the southwest border dropped to 6,072 – a 15 percent decline from March.

Even more striking, CBP reported zero parole-style releases of illegal immigrants – a policy once exploited to flood American communities with unvetted migrants. This stands in stark contrast to the 27,766 releases recorded earlier in 2024. The administration's message is unambiguous: those who break the law will face consequences. (Related: Border crossings DROP BY 94% under Trump's tough immigration policies.)

Since retaking office in January, Trump has signed multiple executive orders to restore order at the border. His directives include expanding physical barriers, prosecuting unlawful entrants and targeting drug cartels.

The results speak for themselves. Border Patrol agents, once demoralized by lax enforcement, are now empowered to do their jobs. As border czar Tom Homan noted, ""President Trump has created the most secure border in the history of the nation.""

The Trump effect: Policy over rhetoric

In April, the White House took an unprecedented step by authorizing the U.S. military to secure federal lands near the border. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth now oversees the Roosevelt Reservation – a 60-foot-wide federal zone spanning California, Arizona and New Mexico.

This move has closed loopholes that previously allowed smugglers and traffickers to exploit protected areas. Combined with aggressive interior enforcement, the strategy has deterred would-be crossers before they even reach U.S. soil.

While illegal immigration declines, drug interdictions are rising – proof that cartels are shifting tactics. Methamphetamine seizures skyrocketed by 102 percent in June, while fentanyl confiscations increased by 3 percent.

CBP Commissioner Rodney Scott credited the administration's ""relentless focus"" on dismantling smuggling networks. Yet the fight is far from over. The surge in narcotics highlights the need for continued vigilance, especially as Mexican cartels grow more desperate.

The impact extends beyond statistics; Yuma, Arizona Mayor Douglas Nicholls described the change as ""peaceful"" after years of strained resources. Hospitals, schools and law enforcement agencies are no longer overwhelmed by endless waves of migrants.

But dangers persist despite progress. Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem revealed an 830 percent increase in assaults on ICE agents this year. These attacks underscore the risks agents face daily, even as the border grows more secure.

Some lawmakers continue resisting enforcement. The VISIBLE Act, introduced by Democrats, seeks to restrict agents from wearing face coverings – a move critics say endangers officers during riots.

Yet the data undermines such opposition. With crossings at record lows and deportations rising, the administration’s policies are undeniably effective.

In June 2024 alone, over 83,000 migrants crossed under former President Joe Biden's watch – more than ten times June 2025's total. Trump's policies have not only stopped the bleeding, but reversed the damage. As Homan noted, ""The world is hearing our message: The border is closed to lawbreakers.""

528,143,France's Macron makes a state visit to the U.K. with migration and Ukraine on the agenda,https://www.nbcnews.com/world/europe/frances-macron-makes-state-visit-uk-migration-ukraine-agenda-rcna217403,2025-07-08T09:45:44Z,NBC News,US,channel crossings,"LONDON — French President Emmanuel Macron arrives in Britain on Tuesday for a state visit mixing royal pageantry with thorny political talks about stopping migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats.

Macron and Prime Minister Keir Starmer will also try to advance plans for a post-ceasefire security force for Ukraine, despite apparent U.S. indifference to the idea and Russia’s refusal to halt the onslaught on its neighbor.

Macron’s three-day visit, at the invitation of King Charles III, is the first state visit to the U.K. by a European Union head of state since Brexit, and a symbol of the British government’s desire to reset relations with the bloc that the U.K. acrimoniously left in 2020.

The president and his wife, Brigitte Macron, will be driven to Windsor Castle by horse-drawn carriage, greeted by a military honor guard and treated to a state banquet hosted by the king and Queen Camilla. The British royals made a state visit to France in September 2023.

Macron also will address both houses of Britain’s Parliament in the building’s fabulously ornate Royal Gallery before sitting down for talks with Starmer on migration, defense and investment.

At a U.K.-France summit on Thursday, senior government officials from the two countries will discuss small-boat crossings, a thorny issue for successive governments on both sides of the channel.

Britain receives fewer asylum-seekers than Mediterranean European countries, but thousands of migrants each year use northern France as a launching point to reach the U.K., either by stowing away in trucks or — after a clampdown on that route — in small boats across one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.

The U.K. has struck a series of deals with France over the years to increase patrols of beaches and share intelligence in an attempt to disrupt the smuggling gangs.

It has all had only a limited impact. About 37,000 people were detected crossing the English Channel in small boats in 2024, the second-highest annual figure after 46,000 in 2022. More than 20,000 people made the crossing in the first six months of 2025, up by about 50% from the same period last year. Dozens of people have died attempting the crossing.

Starmer, whose center-left government was elected a year ago, has pledged to “ smash the gangs ” behind organized people-smuggling. His plan rests on closer cooperation with France and with countries further up the migrants’ route from Africa and the Middle East. The U.K. also aims to strike deals with individual nations to take back failed asylum seekers.

British officials have been pushing for French police to intervene more forcefully to stop the boats, and welcomed the sight of officers slashing rubber dinghies with knives in recent days.

U.K. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said the French are “bringing in important new tactics to stop boats that are in the water.”

Britain also is pushing France to let officers intervene against boats in deeper waters, a change the government in Paris is considering. Campaigners for migrants’ rights and a police union warn that doing so could endanger both migrants and officers.

Starmer spokesperson Tom Wells said some of the tactics being discussed are “operationally and legally complex, but we’re working closely with the French.”

The two leaders have worked closely together to rally support for Ukraine, though they have taken contrasting approaches to U.S. President Donald Trump, with Macron more willing to challenge the American president than the emollient Starmer.

Britain and France have led efforts to form an international peacekeeping force for Ukraine to reinforce a future ceasefire with European troops and equipment and U.S. security guarantees.

Trump has shown little enthusiasm for the idea, however, and a ceasefire remains elusive. British officials say the “coalition of the willing” idea is alive and well, with Macron and Starmer due to join an international videoconference on Thursday to discuss planning for the force.

529,8,Palestinian newborns starving in Gaza as infant formula runs out,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/31/palestinian-newborns-starving-in-gaza-as-infant-formula-runs-out,2025-07-31T20:40:26Z,Al Jazeera English,US,channel crossings,"Mothers fill bottles with water and whatever food they can find as Israel’s blockade continues to fuel starvation crisis.

Palestinian mothers in the Gaza Strip are desperately trying to feed their newborns as Israel’s punishing blockade on the besieged enclave has led to dire shortages of infant formula, with some resorting to filling bottles with water and whatever food they can find.

Dr Kahlil Daqran told Al Jazeera on Thursday that as supplies of formula run out, many mothers are often too malnourished to breastfeed their infants.

“In the Gaza Strip, we have thousands of children being starved because there is no milk for children under the age of two,” Daqran said.

“These children, their mothers also have malnutrition because there is no food, so the mothers cannot produce milk. Now, our children are being fed either water or ground hard legumes, and this is harmful for children in Gaza.”

Azhar Imad, 31, said she has mixed tahini with water in hopes of feeding four-month-old Joury. But she said she fears the mixture will make her baby sick.

“I am using this paste instead of milk, but she won’t drink it. All these can cause illnesses,” Imad said. “Sometimes, I give her water in the bottle; there’s nothing available. I make her caraway and herbs, any kind of herbs.”

Israel’s blockade on Gaza, which has been under Israeli military bombardment since October 2023, has led to critical shortages of food, water, medicine and other humanitarian supplies.

Local hospitals said on Thursday that at least two more deaths from Israel’s forced starvation were reported in the last 24 hours, bringing the total number of hunger-related fatalities since Israel’s war began to 159, including 90 children.

The United Nations has warned that Palestinian children are especially vulnerable as hunger grips the coastal territory, and UN officials have repeatedly called on Israel to allow an uninterrupted flow of aid supplies.

Israel has blamed the UN for the starvation crisis unfolding in the Gaza Strip, saying the global body had failed to pick up supplies.

UN officials, and several nations, have rejected that claim as false and stressed that Israel has refused to offer safe routes for humanitarian agencies to transport aid into Gaza.

Airdrops of humanitarian supplies, carried out in recent days, have also done little to address the widespread hunger crisis. Experts denounced the effort as dangerous, costly and ineffective.

Farhan Haq, deputy spokesperson for UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, told reporters on Thursday that the UN and its partners “continue to seize every opportunity to collect supplies from the Israeli-controlled crossings and replenish those platforms with new supplies”.

“Our colleagues say that, despite Israeli announcements regarding the designation of convoy routes as secure, trucks continue to face long delays that expose drivers, aid workers, and crowds to danger,” Haq said.

“The long waits are because a single route has been made available for our teams exiting Kerem Shalom [Karem Abu Salem crossing] inside Gaza, and Israeli ground forces have set up an ad hoc checkpoint on that route.”

As starvation continues to grip Gaza, more Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while seeking aid at distribution sites operated by the controversial Israeli- and United States-backed GHF.

A source at al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital told Al Jazeera that at least 23 people were killed after Israeli forces opened fire at them on Thursday morning as they waited for aid near Netzarim junction in central Gaza.

The deadly incident came just hours before the White House announced that US President Donald Trump’s special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, and US Ambassador to Israel Mike Huckabee are expected to enter Gaza on Friday to inspect the aid distribution sites.

White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that the US officials also would meet with Palestinians to “hear firsthand about this dire situation on the ground”.

Reporting from the Jordanian capital, Amman, Al Jazeera’s Nour Odeh explained that the trip comes amid growing concern in Washington that US contractors may be found liable for the deaths of more than 1,000 Palestinians killed while trying to reach GHF sites since May.

“There is a lot of pressure and insistence in Israel that those sites must continue to operate even if Israel allows more aid into Gaza,” Odeh said.

“This organisation was set up to bypass the United Nations, and Israel is not ready to let it go despite the resistance from the international community to engage with it in any way because it is accused of violating humanitarian principles.”

Hamas said in a statement released via its Telegram channel late on Thursday that it is ready to “immediately” engage in negotiations to end the war in Gaza “once aid reaches those who deserve it and the humanitarian crisis and famine in Gaza are ended”.

Meanwhile, in Gaza, countless families continue to face a desperate search for food.

Nehma Hamouda said she has struggled to keep her three-month-old granddaughter, Muntaha, alive amid the shortage of infant formula.

Muntaha’s mother was shot by Israeli soldiers when she was pregnant. She gave birth to her daughter prematurely but died weeks later.

“I resort to tea for the girl,” said Hamouda, explaining that her granddaughter cannot process solid foods yet.

“She’s not eating, and there’s no sugar. Where can I get her sugar? I give her a bit [of anise], and she drinks a bit,” she said. “At times, when we get lentil soup from the soup kitchen, I strain the water, and I try to feed her.

The prime minister met Mr Macron this afternoon as part of the French president's state visit to the UK, which began on Tuesday.

High up the agenda for the two leaders is the need to tackle small boat crossings in the Channel, which Mr Macron said yesterday was a ""burden"" for both the UK and France.

Politics latest: Plans for Donald Trump UK visit in 'coming weeks'

The small boats crisis is a pressing issue for the prime minister, given that more than 20,000 migrants crossed the English Channel to the UK in the first six months of this year - a rise of almost 50% on the number crossing in 2024.

Sir Keir is hoping he can reach a deal for a one-in one-out return treaty with France, ahead of the UK-France summit on Thursday, which will involve ministerial teams from both nations.

The deal would see those crossing the Channel illegally sent back to France in exchange for Britain taking in any asylum seeker with a family connection in the UK.

However, it is understood the deal is still in the balance, with some EU countries unhappy about France and the UK agreeing on a bilateral deal.

French newspaper Le Monde reports that up to 50 small boat migrants could be sent back to France each week, starting from August, as part of an agreement between Sir Keir and Mr Macron.

A statement from Downing Street said: ""The prime minister met the French President Emmanuel Macron in Downing Street this afternoon.

""They reflected on the state visit of the president so far, agreeing that it had been an important representation of the deep ties between our two countries.

""Moving on to discuss joint working, they shared their desire to deepen our partnership further - from joint leadership in support of Ukraine to strengthening our defence collaboration and increasing bilateral trade and investment.""

It added: ""The leaders agreed tackling the threat of irregular migration and small boat crossings is a shared priority that requires shared solutions.

""The prime minister spoke of his government's toughening of the system in the past year to ensure rules are respected and enforced, including a massive surge in illegal working arrests to end the false promise of jobs that are used to sell spaces on boats.

""The two leaders agreed on the need to go further and make progress on new and innovative solutions, including a new deterrent to break the business model of these gangs.""

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, seized on the statement to criticise Labour for scrapping the Conservatives' Rwanda plan, which the Tories claim would have sent asylum seekers ""entering the UK illegally"" to Rwanda.

He said in an online post: ""We had a deterrent ready to go, where every single illegal immigrant arriving over the Channel would be sent to Rwanda.

""But Starmer cancelled this before it had a chance to start.

""Now, a year later, he's realised he made a massive mistake. That's why numbers have surged and this year so far has been the worst in history for illegal channel crossings.

HM Coastguard said Border Force and RNLI vessels had been deployed as part of the response.

It came hours after Sir Keir Starmer and French President Emmanuel Macron announced a deal they said was designed to crack down on small boats.

The number of crossings tends to be higher when the weather in the Channel is calm, as it was on Friday morning.

At least 21,000 people have already made the journey since January, putting 2025 on course to be a record year for crossings.

The latest Home Office figures show 573 people made the crossing in 10 boats on Thursday.

According to the Red Cross, many people cross the English Channel in the hopes of finding and joining family who have already made it to the UK.

It says people are often separated from their loved ones as they flee their homes or on their journey in search of safety, which can take many years.

Channel crossings rise 50% in first six months of 2025

Hundreds more migrants arrive on 'red day' Sadiya Chowdhury News correspondent @esadiya Today is an example of what the Home Office calls a ""red day"". It's 22C at the port of Dover, the wave level is low and visibility is good. The government says these conditions increase the likelihood of small boat crossings. Within an hour of us arriving, a Border Force vessel docks and a stream of people wearing bright lifejackets walk off and up the jetty to an asylum processing tent. Someone is carrying what looks like a small child - 81 people have arrived on this boat. It's deceiving standing on this cliff top, looking out at the blue-green English Channel glistening in the sunshine. This is not the calm body of water it appears to be. One of the busiest shipping lanes in the world, the journey across from France is treacherous, and as full of risks as it may be of hope and ambition. Judging by the numbers Sky News teams have counted today (296 arrivals so far), those making the journey have not been deterred by the prime minister's deal with the French.

The UK hosts less than 1% of the world's refugees, with 71% seeking safety in neighbouring countries to their own. For example, the Red Cross says Jordan currently hosts 1.3 million refugees from neighbouring Syria.

Many of those seeking refuge in the UK rather than other European countries do so because they can speak English.

Under the terms of the ""one in, one out"" scheme agreed between the UK and France, people who cross the Channel will be returned to France each week in exchange for the same number of asylum seekers who have been accepted to come to the UK.

534,27,UK Launches Sanctions on Groups Accused of Aiding Illegal Migrants,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/07/23/uk-launches-sanctions-on-groups-accused-of-facilitating-illegal-migration/,2025-07-23T16:11:06Z,Breitbart News,US,channel crossings,"(AFP) — The UK imposed sanctions Wednesday on more than two dozen people, groups and suppliers from the Balkans, the Middle East and China accused of helping migrants cross the Channel.

In what it called a “landmark” first use of new powers, the move came as the government faces political pressure to stem migrant arrivals on small boats from northern France, at record levels.

The asset freezes and travel bans announced target individuals and entities “driving irregular migration to the UK”, and include four “gangs” and “gangland bosses” operating in the Balkans, the Foreign Office said.

They also hit a small boat supplier in China, so-called “hawala” money movers in the Middle East, and seven alleged people-smugglers linked to Iraq.

Foreign Secretary David Lammy called it “a landmark moment in the government’s work to tackle organised immigration crime” impacting the UK.

“From Europe to Asia we are taking the fight to the people-smugglers who enable irregular migration, targeting them wherever they are in the world,” he added.

“My message to the gangs who callously risk vulnerable lives for profit is this: we know who you are, and we will work with our partners around the world to hold you to account.”

Prime Minister Keir Starmer took office a year ago promising to curb the journeys by “smashing the gangs” that facilitate the crossings, but he has struggled to deliver.

Nearly 24,000 migrants have made the perilous journey across the Channel so far in 2025, the highest ever tally at this point in a year.

The issue has become politically perilous in the UK, blamed for helping to fuel the rise of the far-right and violence at anti-migrant demonstrations.

Protests have erupted sporadically outside hotels believed to house asylum-seekers, with a recent demonstration outside one in Epping, east of London, descending into clashes that injured eight police officers.

Riots sparked by the stabbing to death of three young girls in northwestern Southport a year ago also saw suspected asylum-seeker hotels attacked and anti-migrant sentiment on display.

As part of its strategy to curb new arrivals, the government is also cracking down on illegal working, which European neighbours cite as a “pull factor” for UK-bound migrants.

It announced late Tuesday a new agreement with delivery firms Deliveroo, Just Eat and Uber Eats which includes sharing the locations of asylum hotels to help tackle illegal working.

Meanwhile in another new tactic, artificial intelligence technology will be trialled to assess disputed ages of asylum-seekers who claim to be children, the interior ministry said Tuesday.

Wednesday’s designations represent the UK’s first use of its new “Global Irregular Migration Sanctions Regime”.

It claims the regime is a “world first”, empowering the Foreign Office to target foreign financiers and companies as well as individuals allegedly involved in facilitating people-smuggling to the UK.

In all, it sanctioned 20 individuals, four gangs — two Balkan groups and two of North African origin operating in the Balkans — and Chinese firm Weihai Yamar Outdoor Product Co.

It has advertised its small boats online “explicitly for the purpose of people-smuggling,” the Foreign Office said.

Among those facing curbs was Bledar Lala, described as an Albanian controlling “the ‘Belgium operations’ of an organised criminal group” involved in the crossings.

The UK also targeted Alen Basil, a former police translator it accused of now leading a large smuggling network in Serbia, “terrorising refugees, with the aid of corrupt policemen”.

London hit alleged “gangland boss” Mohammed Tetwani with sanctions, noting he was dubbed the “King of Horgos” over his brutal running of a migrant camp in the Serbian town Horgos.

Author and researcher Tom Keatinge, of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), said the sanctions were “a new front in the UK’s efforts to control a business model that brings profit to the enablers” and misery to victims.

“However, I would caution against overpromising,” he told AFP. “Talk of freezing assets and using sanctions to ‘smash the gangs’ seems far-fetched and remains to be seen.

“History suggests that such assertions hold governments hostage to fortune.”",NewsAPI,13.55,,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Mixed,31.01,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/,https://ground.news/interest/breitbart,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/breitbart,RIGHT (8.1),MIXED (6.4),USA,,Website,High Traffic,LOW CREDIBILITY,Right,Breitbart News Network LLC,2007,6,Right,Mixed,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,breitbart.com,,breitbart news,41,USA,Y,H,Breitbart,
535,85,Britain And France Hope Migrant ‘Taxi Boat’ Plan Will Slow Record Channel Crossings,https://gcaptain.com/britain-and-france-hope-migrant-taxi-boat-plan-will-slow-record-channel-crossings/,2025-07-06T02:33:27Z,gcaptain.com,US,channel crossings,"By Gabriel Stargardter

CALAIS, France, July 4 (Reuters) – Early one morning this week, a dinghy motored along a vast beach in northern France, stopping every few hundred meters to pick up migrants bound for Britain. Four French police gave chase, but failed to reach the migrants before they reached water’s edge.

Soon, with 70-odd people onboard, the dinghy began chugging across the sea, adding to a record-breaking number of migrants crossing the Channel this year. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer’s right-wing opponents have seized on the data, reminding him he had pledged to “smash” the trafficking gangs.

France and Britain hope to unveil measures at their summit next week that will reportedly allow French police to intercept such ‘taxi boats’ – a new phenomenon – up to 300 meters (yards) from shore rather than only if lives are at risk as now.

Police, activists and migrants interviewed by Reuters were skeptical such a plan would work.

“I just don’t see how this could ever be implemented,” said Julien Soir, a police union representative in the northern city of Lille. “Getting it up and running is simply impossible.”

He said police were already stretched covering 180 km (112 miles) of coastline and lack the equipment and training needed for seaborne operations. Police also fear drowning if they fall in the water with heavy equipment, or personal legal liability if migrants die or are injured during an intervention.

Angele Vettorello, a coordinator at the Utopia 56 charity in Calais, said numbers were rising despite more French police patrolling beaches, including with British-sponsored drones.

She said the proposed measures would only make a dangerous crossing – last year 73 migrants died navigating what is one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes – more perilous.

If implemented, it would “lead to even more deaths … more distress,” she said.

Asked if France would go ahead with the plan, an aide to President Emmanuel Macron told reporters announcements would be saved for the summit on Thursday, adding that both countries were working to intensify efforts to prevent crossings and break the traffickers’ lucrative economic model.

RIGHT-WING RISE

The influx of migrants has helped Nigel Farage’s Reform UK overtake Starmer’s Labour Party in polls. Farage, a right-wing populist and longtime immigration hard-liner, has proposed using the Navy to intercept migrant vessels and take them back to France. Lawyers say this could only be done if France agreed.

Nearly 20,000 asylum seekers have arrived in Britain via small boats so far this year, a 50% increase compared to the same period in 2024. French and British authorities blame the spike on unusually good weather.

Peter Walsh, from Oxford University’s Migration Observatory, said maritime interception may stop more migrants but would not affect long-term trends behind the migrant surge, including multiple conflicts and the allure of English-speaking Britain.

Britain also wants to negotiate a returns agreement with France, which it had before it left the European Union.

At a filthy migrant camp near Dunkirk, Reuters spoke with several migrants who were unaware of the new proposal. They said it wouldn’t stop them from trying to cross.

Israrullah Lodin, 26, left Afghanistan in 2021 after his family’s work with the U.S. army irked the Taliban. He had failed to cross three times; twice he was stopped by police and once his boat had problems. Lodin dreamed of working in a UK fulfillment warehouse. Nothing would stop him from getting there.

“We are not afraid to die,” he said. “I have to reach my destination.”

Nisarahmad Afghan, 23, had been a migrant almost all his adult life, having left his home region of Nangarhar four years ago. He had made two failed attempts to cross, both foiled by police.

“Until I succeed, I will keep trying,” he said. “I’ve passed through many dangerous roads. I will pass this one too.”

Watch: PM says he understands what President Trump cares about

Sir Keir Starmer has said he ""understands what anchors"" US President Donald Trump, having built a relationship on shared family values. Despite ""different political backgrounds"" the prime minister said he found common ground with Trump, and that their ""good personal relationship"" helped land a vital US tariff deal. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Political Thinking programme, Sir Keir revealed Trump reached out to console him after the death of his younger brother Nick Starmer on Boxing Day. ""For both of us, we really care about family and there's a point of connection there,"" he said. ""I think I do understand what anchors the president, what he really cares about.""

Sir Keir revealed he first spoke to Trump as prime minister after the then-presidential candidate was shot at a rally in July last year. ""That was a phone call really to ask him how it was, and in particular I wanted to know how it impacted on his family,"" he said. He added that Trump later called him after the death of his brother. ""We talked about my brother, and he was asking about him,"" Sir Keir said. Sir Keir denied this week's painful series of U-turns on welfare reforms were because he had been too focused on foreign affairs and ""taken his eye off the ball"" domestically. On Tuesday, the government avoided defeat on its proposals to overhaul disability benefits by offering late concessions to Labour MPs threatening to rebel. The prime minister said he took responsibility for the episode, admitting it had been a ""tough"" few days but insisting the government would ""come through this stronger"" after a period of reflection.

The prime minister said forging close ties with figures such as Trump and French President Emmanuel Macron were ""always in the national interest"". ""Building those relationships with international leaders is hugely important,"" he said. The prime minister said the personal rapport had helped secure a deal removing UK industries from some of the sweeping tariffs announced by Trump. Before the deal he said he had seen ""anxiety writ large"" on the faces of British factory workers at Jaguar Land Rover in Solihull. ""After the deal, the relief was palpable,"" he said. Sir Keir said discussions ""over a glass of wine"" with Macron on a train to Kyiv had also paved the way for a new agreement with the EU, which he claimed would lead to lower food prices in British supermarkets. ""That is a good thing for millions of people across the country,"" he said. Sir Keir is due to meet Macron again next week as the French president comes to the UK for a state visit. Tackling small boat crossings will be a key point of discussion, after Downing Street said last month the situation in the English Channel was ""deteriorating"".

At least 15 Palestinians, mostly children, died of starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours, bringing the total to 101 since the start of the blockade and ongoing military campaign.

Since Israel sealed Gaza's main crossings on March 2, essential food and medical aid have been largely blocked. The U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), operating outside the United Nations (UN) framework, has faced harsh criticism for restricted and dangerous aid distributions.

The UN reported that over 900 Palestinians have been killed and more than 60,000 injured while attempting to access GHF aid, with sites described as ""mass death traps"" due to Israeli and U.S.-affiliated attacks on desperate civilians.

The World Food Programme (WFP) and Gaza authorities warn of catastrophic hunger affecting 1.25 million people. Over 96 percent of the population suffers from severe food insecurity, with 650,000 children under five at acute risk of malnutrition.

The Palestinian Health Ministry, UNRWA and global medical organizations accuse Israel of deliberate starvation and possible crimes against humanity, demanding immediate ceasefire and unrestricted humanitarian access.

The Palestinian Health Ministry reported on Monday, July 22, that at least 15 Palestinians, most of them children, have died from starvation in Gaza in the past 24 hours, bringing the total death toll from hunger and malnutrition to 101 since the beginning of the genocide in Gaza.

According to several reports, since Israel's closure of Gaza's main border crossings on March 2, no significant quantities of food or medicine have reached the population through traditional humanitarian channels. While limited aid has been distributed by the U.S.-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) since late May, the initiative has come under fierce criticism from rights groups and United Nations (UN) officials for bypassing the UN and restricting aid to specific ""safe zones"" under military oversight. (Related: Gaza faces ""catastrophic"" famine with 93% of population in crisis, aid groups say.)

The UN described these GHF aid sites as ""mass death traps,"" where Israeli forces and U.S.-affiliated mercenaries have reportedly killed over 900 Palestinians seeking food and wounded more than 60,000. Another 46 individuals are still missing.

In line with this, the latest data of the Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor revealed that at least one Palestinian died of hunger every 80 minutes on Sunday, July 20, accusing Israel of implementing ""a systematic starvation policy"" against Gaza's two million residents.

The UN and international humanitarian agencies echoed the alarm. The World Food Program (WFP) warned that one in three Gazans is now going days without food, with thousands ""on the verge of catastrophic hunger."" Gaza's Government Media Office estimated that 1.25 million people, more than half the enclave's population, are experiencing catastrophic hunger. Nearly the entire population, 96 percent, now faces severe food insecurity.

More than 650,000 children under five are at ""imminent and severe risk of acute malnutrition,"" the office added.

""This is a generation being starved to death,"" said the director of Gaza's Al-Shifa Hospital, describing scenes of widespread collapse, memory loss and exhaustion among patients, most of whom are children. ""We have 17,000 children suffering from severe malnutrition. We don't have enough beds or medicine.""

Medical professionals, including Dr. Suhaib al-Hams, director of the Al-Mawasi field hospital, are warning of an imminent ""wave of deaths"" from organ failure, with a growing epidemic of intestinal illness, exhaustion and memory loss attributed to prolonged hunger.

International aid groups accuse Israel of crimes against humanity

In line with the data, the Palestinian Health Ministry issued an urgent plea Monday: ""This is a silent massacre. The Ministry of Health holds the Israeli occupation and the international community fully responsible. We urgently call for the immediate opening of all crossings to allow the entry of food and medicine,"" the ministry said.

It held both the Israeli government and the international community responsible for the crisis, demanding the immediate and unconditional opening of all border crossings to allow food and medical aid to enter the besieged enclave.

The UN's relief agency for Palestinian refugees, United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), also condemned the starvation as deliberate: ""The Israeli Authorities are starving civilians in Gaza. Among them are one million children.""

Doctors Without Borders also issued a grave warning on Monday, saying the deliberate restriction and manipulation of humanitarian aid ""may constitute crimes against humanity."" The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies warned that Palestinians in Gaza now face ""an acute risk of famine,"" stating, ""No one should have to risk their life to get basic humanitarian assistance.""

Meanwhile, the WFP stated: ""Only a massive scale-up in food aid distributions can stabilize this spiraling situation, calm anxieties and rebuild the trust within communities that more food is coming. An agreed ceasefire is long overdue.""

Watch: Farage drowned out by jeers at PMQs

The UK must refuse to accept ""undocumented males"" arriving in the UK in small boats as part of any deal with French President Emmanuel Macron, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage has said. The prime minister is hoping to finalise an agreement on tackling small boat crossings during Macron's three-day state visit, the first by a French president since 2008. Speaking ahead of the summit, Farage said Sir Keir Starmer must not to bow to an ""increasingly arrogant, anti-Brexit French president"" and protect the UK's say over who settles here. Sir Keir said he was seeking ""serious answers to serious problems"" with allies, calling Farage's approach, ""break everything and claim that's how you fix things"".

During the exchanges at Prime Minister's Questions, Farage said voters had backed Brexit ""because we wanted to take back control of our borders"". Farage said: ""Does the prime minister understand that demand is even greater now than it was in 2016? ""Does he understand the country demands that you say to the French president 'we will not accept undocumented males across the English Channel' and that you are not dictated to by an increasingly arrogant, anti-Brexit French president?"" Responding in the Commons, Sir Keir accused Farage of exploiting the issue for political gain. ""We are fixing the mess we inherited and working with other countries to ensure we take the measures necessary to stop people crossing the Channel,"" the prime minister said. ""They are serious answers to serious problems."" Sir Keir said the Conservative Party had been following Farage's approach to ""break everything and claim that's how you fix things"" and ""stick two fingers up at your neighbours then expect them to work with us"".

Following PMQs, Sir Keir held the first of two days of meetings with the French president at Downing Street. No new deal was reached, but Sir Keir and Macron agreed ""a new deterrent"" was needed to stop small boats, a readout of the meeting said. Both leaders agreed stopping small boat crossings was ""a shared priority"" and vowed to push to ""go further and make progress on new and innovative solutions,"" Downing Street said. By the end of the week, the prime minister is hoping to announce a new agreement, potentially including a ""one in, one out"" migrants return policy with France. The arrangement would allow Britain to return migrants who arrive by small boat to France in exchange for accepting asylum seekers with a family connection in the UK. A group of five Mediterranean countries have written to the European Commission about the issue, complaining they may be forced to accept people deported from the UK. Sir Keir has also been pushing for France to revise its rules to allow police to intervene when boats are in shallow water, rather than requiring them still to be on land. Last week the BBC witnessed French officers use a knife to puncture an inflatable boat after it had launched in an apparent change of tactics.

Earlier in the Commons, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the UK should freeze any new funding to the French government unless it agrees to take back Channel migrants. Speaking at PMQs, Sir Ed said: ""The Conservative government badly undermined the security of our borders by ripping up the returns agreement that allowed us to send migrants back to Europe. ""So I hope the prime minister can secure a new returns agreement with France that acts as a real deterrent to stop the boats."" Responding, Sir Keir said he was meeting President Macron over two days to strike a new agreement and would ""only provide funding that delivers for our priorities"".

Small boat arrivals hit a record high in the first half of 2025, with nearly 20,000 people crossing the Channel. This is despite the UK giving over £700m to France since 2018 to fund improved coastal patrols and surveillance. Following PMQs, the prime minister's spokesman said the government has been ""addressing the issue"" of ""migration pull factors"", after Macron raised the issue in a speech. The president said the UK and France ""would only arrive at the lasting and effective solution"" to people crossing the Channel in small boats if the ""pull factors"" attracting them to the UK were addressed. When asked if Sir Keir agreed with Macron, the PM's spokesman said the government was ""toughening every part of the system to ensure the rules are enforced and respected"". He said illegal working undermined businesses and wages, adding ""the British public won't stand for it and neither will this government"". ""That's why we've surged illegal working raids and arrests,"" he said.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,

The King visited an RNLI station in Walmer Beach, Kent, and while there he took part in a litter pick and greeted members of the public.

Among the volunteers he spoke to were three crew members being honoured for a rescue operation from around two-and-a-half years ago.

On 14 December 2022, four people died and 43 were rescued when a small boat began taking on water during an attempted crossing by migrants of the Channel.

Volunteer Daniel Sinclair told the King the boat was ""not very seaworthy"". He described the rescue as ""traumatic"".

In response, the King asked: ""Do you get a lot of those call outs?""

Mr Sinclair said: ""Not so much here,"" before adding that the stations in Ramsgate and Dover were used more for channel crossings.

This marks the second time the monarch has spoken about small boat crossings this week.

On Tuesday evening, at a state banquet to mark the start of Emmanuel Macron's three-day visit to the UK, the King told guests that increased cooperation between the UK and France would protect against ""profound challenges"" like terrorism, organised crime and ""irregular migration"" across the English Channel.

At the end of the visit, Sir Keir Starmer and Mr Macron announced a new migrant return pilot that would see some people sent back to France.

Mr Sinclair recalled the events of the rescue from 2022.

Ibrahima Bah was jailed for almost a decade in February last year, as he piloted the boat that sank after setting off from France.

During the trial, jurors were told the homemade boat should have had no more than 20 people on board, but carried at least 43 that night.

540,269,"UK, France unveil migrants deal as Macron wraps up state visit",https://www.yahoo.com/news/macron-wraps-uk-state-visit-024920173.html,2025-07-10T02:49:20Z,Yahoo Entertainment,US,channel crossings,"London and Paris unveiled a ""pilot"" programme on Thursday to return to France some of the migrants arriving in the UK on small boats across the Channel, as President Emmanuel Macron wrapped up his state visit.

Prime Minister Keir Starmer called the deal, hammered out during the French leader's three-day visit, ""groundbreaking"" and capable of stemming the record numbers of people who have embarked on the perilous journey so far this year.

""This is groundbreaking, because this is a scheme intended to break the model, and to make it clear that if you cross in a small boat, then you'll end up where you started,"" he said in a joint press conference with Macron.

""In exchange for every return, a different individual will be allowed to come here"" in a safe manner, Starmer said, adding that the scheme would start within ""the coming weeks"".

Although Starmer did not say how many people might be returned to France, media reports suggest it could initially total around 50 people a week.

In comments likely to infuriate pro-Brexit groups, Macron said Britain's 2020 departure from the EU had worsened the situation in the Channel, cutting off legal migration routes and access to the bloc's own returns agreements.

""So for people wanting to cross, there is no legal way, nor a way of sending people back after a crossing,"" Macron said.

""This is a pull factor to attempt the crossing -- exactly the inverse effect of what Brexit promised.""

- Wide-ranging focus -

Alongside migration, the two leaders used the visit to work on a raft of initiatives and shared concerns over defence, trade and culture.

They included addressing the volatile situation in the Middle East, continued support for Ukraine and a ""reboot"" of defence ties, including joint missile development and nuclear cooperation.

Among the announcements was a commitment to increase from 10,000 to 50,000 troops a Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF) established more than a decade ago.

The cross-Channel allies also said they would order more Storm Shadow cruise missiles -- long-range, air-launched weapons jointly developed by the allies -- while stepping up work on a replacement system.

The missiles have been shipped to Ukraine in significant numbers to help Kyiv in its war with Russia following Moscow's full-scale 2022 invasion.

Starmer and Macron dialed into a meeting Thursday of the so-called ""coalition of the willing"" on Ukraine, announcing that new headquarters for the European-led, 30-nation grouping had opened in Paris.

Britain and France are spearheading talks among the coalition on how to support a possible ceasefire in Ukraine, including potentially deploying peacekeeping forces.

Meanwhile Macron urged joint UK-France recognition of a Palestinian state, calling such moves ""the only hope for peace"" in the conflict-ridden region.

- Time for pomp -

The visit also saw the typical British pomp and pageantry of such occasions, with King Charles III and Queen Camilla welcoming Macron and his wife Brigitte to Windsor Castle on Tuesday.

The entourage enjoyed a horse-drawn carriage procession, a 41-gun salute and a banquet at Windsor Castle, west of London, where the Francophile king and French leader toasted a new ""entente amicale"".

However, much of the attention over the three-day visit focused on the vexing issue of cross-Channel migration.

It has become a major headache for Starmer's year-old Labour government, as support for the upstart anti-immigrant Reform UK party soars.

More than 21,000 migrants have made the Channel crossing in rudimentary vessels this year alone.

As the leaders met Thursday, the UK Coastguard said a number of the small boats headed to southeast England had been sighted in the Channel.

Meanwhile Reform UK leader Nigel Farage reacted to the returns deal, branding it ""a humiliation for Brexit Britain"".

""We have acted today as an EU member and bowed down to an arrogant French President,"" Farage said on X.

The main opposition Conservative Party also criticised the plan, accusing Starmer of ""weak and ineffective gimmicks""

The mooted migrant-exchange scheme has also sparked ""serious concerns"" among some other European nations.

Watch: PM says migrant return scheme to begin ""in weeks""

The UK will begin returning migrants arriving in small boats to France within weeks under a new pilot scheme, Sir Keir Starmer has said. Under the ""one in, one out"" deal, some arrivals would be returned to France and in exchange the UK would accept an equivalent number of asylum seekers, subject to security checks. Speaking alongside French President Emmanuel Macron at the end of a three-day state visit, the prime minister said the plan would show that attempts to cross the Channel in small boats would ""be in vain"". It had been reported that the scheme would see up to 50 people a week being returned, but Sir Keir did not confirm any figures.

He said the ""ground-breaking"" plan would help ""break the model"" of the people smugglers, and would be ramped up if it was successful. Illegal migration was, he said, ""a global crisis, an EU crisis and a crisis for our two nations"". Since 2018, when figures began to be gathered, more than 170,000 people have arrived in the UK in small boats. Numbers this year have reached record levels with nearly 20,000 arriving in the first six months of 2025. Macron said the scheme would have a ""deterrent effect"" beyond the numbers returned. He added that Brexit had made it harder for the UK to tackle illegal migration, arguing that the British people were ""sold a lie... which is that the problem was Europe"". During the press conference, the two leaders also announced that their countries would: co-ordinate their nuclear deterrents , meaning they would jointly mobilise their weapons in the event of an attack

meaning they would jointly mobilise their weapons in the event of an attack strengthen collaboration on supercomputers and AI

""speed up and accelerate"" co-operation on anti-ship missiles. Some details of the small boats deal, including how the UK would decide who to send back to France, remain unclear, although it is understood the pilot will start with adults. Those living in France but wanting to come to the UK would be able to express interest in applying for asylum via an online platform. Priority would be given to those from countries most prone to people smugglers, as well as to people with links to the UK. In a statement released after the press conference, the government said the agreement would be signed ""subject to completing prior legal scrutiny in full transparency and understanding with the [European] Commission and EU Member states"". Other EU countries – such as Spain and Italy - may have concerns that returned migrants could then be sent to them. Under EU rules, individuals sent back to France would have to claim asylum in the first European country they arrived in, often places bordering the Mediterranean Sea.

Sir Keir said there was ""no silver bullet here, but with a united effort, new tactics and a new level of intent, we can finally turn the tables"". In addition to the returns pilot, he also promised ""a crackdown"" on illegal working, which would ensure the jobs promised by traffickers to migrants ""would no longer exist"". The government has said it has plans to bear down on illegal working hot spots, such as deliver riders. Macron said the two countries would ""intensify joint action"" in the countries of origin and transit.

Announcing the pilot, Sir Keir said: ""I know some people will still ask, why should we take anyone in - so let me address that directly. ""We accept genuine asylum seekers because it is right that we offer a haven to those in most dire need. ""But there is also something else, something more practical which is that we simply cannot solve a challenge like stopping the boats by acting alone and telling our allies that we won't play ball."" Conservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp said the deal would ""only return one in every 17 illegal immigrants arriving"". ""Allowing 94% of illegal immigrants to stay will make no difference whatsoever and have no deterrent effect."" Reform UK leader Nigel Farage said the crossings were ""a national security emergency"". ""Frankly the French owe us our money back,"" he added, in a reference to payments made by the UK to support French policing efforts. He said he did not believe the pilot would work, saying: ""If we even try to deport people across the Channel, we will run straight into the European Convention on Human Rights."" John Vine, a former chief inspector of immigration and borders, told the BBC's Newsnight programme that establishing the principle that France should take back some illegal migrants was ""a first"" and ""an achievement in itself"". However, he said the plan would not reduce crossings unless the numbers being returned were ""considerable"". Imran Hussain from the Refugee Council said it was ""right"" for the government to look at ways of targeting the smugglers' business model and the proposal would also provide ""a mechanism potentially where families have a safe and legal route to come to the UK from France"". However, the charity Asylum Matters said: ""We don't need another expensive, ineffective, dangerous Rwanda-style gimmick. ""It's incredibly simple: the only way to stop people from making dangerous journeys is to give them real safe routes to seek sanctuary."" Labour and the previous Conservative governments have both struggled to stem the numbers coming to the UK in small boats. The Conservatives had proposed sending arrivals to Rwanda, but the scheme was delayed by legal challenges. The general election was called before it could be implemented. One of Sir Keir's first acts as prime minister was to scrap the plan, calling it a gimmick. He said his government would focus instead on tackling the smuggling gangs that organise the crossings.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,

The Trump administration is ending temporary legal protections for tens of thousands of migrants from Honduras and Nicaragua, citing improved conditions in both countries.

Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, is a federal program that provides deportation protection and grants work permits to people from certain nations affected by war or natural disasters. Its revocation is part of a slate of Trump administration actions to limit legal protections for certain categories of migrants, including those with temporary status or people seeking asylum.

Sponsor Message

Honduras and Nicaragua first received TPS designation in 1999 following Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5 storm that struck Central America and killed over 10,000 people in the fall of 1998.

President Trump revoked the protections for people from those two countries during his first term. The Biden administration later reinstated them. About 4,000 people from Nicaragua and 72,000 people from Honduras had been covered by TPS.

On Monday, the Department of Homeland Security said Secretary Kristi Noem reviewed the conditions in both countries and determined they have recovered enough from the 1999 hurricane for TPS recipients to safely return. The protections are slated to end in September.

The Secretary of Homeland Security has the power to grant TPS to immigrants of a specific country if conditions there ""temporarily prevent the country's nationals from returning safely, or in certain circumstances, where the country is unable to handle the return of its nationals adequately,"" according to the agency's website.

""Temporary Protected Status was designed to be just that—temporary,"" Noem said in a press release about the end of TPS for Honduras.

Honduras and Nicaragua are the latest countries to be stripped of TPS designation since Trump's return to office. The administration has also sought to end protections for thousands of TPS holders from Afghanistan, Cameroon, Nepal, Haiti and Venezuela.

Those attempts have faced some legal pushback. In March, a federal judge in San Francisco paused the administration's plan to revoke TPS for Venezuelans, though the Supreme Court halted that decision in May. Last week, a federal judge in New York blocked the Trump administration's attempt to end TPS for Haitians ahead of its scheduled expiration in February, calling it unlawful.

In its announcements, DHS encouraged individuals from Honduras and Nicaragua to self-deport through the Customs and Border Protection program.

""Take advantage of a safe, secure way to self-deport which includes a complimentary plane ticket, a $1,000 exit bonus, and potential future opportunities for legal immigration,"" the DHS said in a press release.

WASHINGTON — An appeals court late Monday stepped in to keep in place protections for nearly 12,000 Afghans that have allowed them to work in the U.S. and be protected from deportation after they were set to expire as part of the Trump administration's efforts to make more people eligible for removal from the country.

The Department of Homeland Security in May said it was ending Temporary Protected Status for 11,700 people from Afghanistan in 60 days. That status had allowed them to work and meant the government couldn't deport them.

CASA, a nonprofit immigrant advocacy group, sued the administration over the TPS revocation for Afghans as well as for people from Cameroon — those expire August 4. A federal judge last Friday allowed the lawsuit to go forward but didn't grant CASA's request to keep the protections in place while the lawsuit plays out.

CASA appealed the case Monday and won a stay keeping in place the temporary status for Afghans that was set to expire Monday. The appeals court gave no reason for its decision, but indicated it would be deciding what to do swiftly. The stay is in place for one week, and the court has asked both sides to file briefs this week. The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.

The number of Afghans protected by TPS is relatively small compared to the overall number of Afghans — about 180,000 — who have fled Afghanistan and come to the U.S. since the Taliban retook control of the country in 2021. It's also not clear how many of those 11,7000 covered by TPS have applied for or received other forms of protection, like asylum.

But the removal of the protective status for Afghans has struck a chord with many advocates and volunteers because of the suggestion that it is safe for Afghans — including many who helped the U.S. during its two-decade long war there — to go home.

""Since so many of those losing their protections served alongside U.S. forces, we should honor that service by upholding our promise to provide safety and ensure that they have an opportunity to thrive here. We urge Congress to protect Afghans by providing them permanent status — a commitment that is long overdue,"" said Jennie Murray, President and CEO of the National Immigration Forum.

At the time that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem ended the temporary protected status for Afghans, the department wrote in the decision that the situation in their home country was getting better.

""The Secretary determined that, overall, there are notable improvements in the security and economic situation such that requiring the return of Afghan nationals to Afghanistan does not pose a threat to their personal safety due to armed conflict or extraordinary and temporary conditions,"" according to the May announcement.

Temporary Protected Status can be granted by the Homeland Security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States. They can't be deported and can work legally but they don't have a pathway to citizenship.

The status is inherently precarious because it is up to the Homeland Security secretary to renew the protections regularly — usually every 18 months. The first Trump administration tried to remove many of these temporary protected statuses but was largely foiled by the courts.

This time around, the Trump administration has moved even more aggressively to remove the protections, thus making more people eligible for removal from the country. The administration has pushed to remove temporary protected status from people from seven countries, with Venezuela and Haiti making up the biggest chunk of the hundreds of thousands of people losing their protections.

Critics say that successive administrations essentially rubber-stamped these renewals regardless, and people covered by what's supposed to be a temporary status end up staying in the United States for years.",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,

This time, the resisters were arrested.

Show Caption Hide Caption What we know: Are ICE agents allowed to be masked? ICE agents wearing masks is raising legal and civil rights concerns amid viral arrest videos. Here's what we know now.

Two California surgery center workers are facing federal charges after being accused of scuffling with ICE agents. The July 9 incident captured on video shows the two workers standing in the way of agents, as they tried to detain a man who ran into the surgical building.

To identify the workers, federal agents staked out the Los Angeles-area SCA Health Ontario Advanced Surgery Center for three days following the July 8 confrontation, in which masked, plainclothes ICE agents chased a suspected illegal immigrant into the building.

Federal officials on July 25 said Jose de Jesus Ortega and Danielle Davila have been charged with assaulting a federal officer and conspiracy to prevent by force and intimidation a federal officer from discharging his duties. Ortega was arrested on July 25, and authorities said they're still pursuing Davila.

The video, which went viral, shows two surgery center workers in scrubs yelling and blocking one of the agents from detaining the man.

Federal officials criticized what they said was a ""false narrative"" in the media and online that portrayed the detainee as a patient at the clinic. According to authorities, the ICE agents saw the truck stop outside the building, and when they approached the men, the men ran.

According to court records, the agents had no specific knowledge that the man who ran into the clinic was living in the country illegally, and had been following the truck in which he was riding as part of a ""roving patrol"" in their unmarked vehicle.

""The illegal alien arrested inside the surgery center was not a patient,"" United States Attorney Bill Essayli said in a statement. ""He ran inside for cover and these defendants attempted to block his apprehension by assaulting our agents. It doesn’t matter who you are or where you work, if you assault our agents or otherwise interfere with our operations, you will be arrested and charged with a federal crime.""

In a July 9 social media post, Homeland Security officials said the man who agents were chasing is Honduran national Denis Guillen-Solis. They said he was living illegally in the United States.

""He ended up near the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center where hospital staff assaulted law enforcement and drug the officer and illegal alien into the facility,"" DHS said in the post. ""Then, the staff attempted to obstruct the arrest by locking the door, blocking law enforcement vehicles from moving, and even called the cops claiming there was a 'kidnapping.'""

The video is among the latest examples of people delaying or obstructing ICE agents carrying out President Donald Trump's mass-immigration initiative, which has also sparked widespread protests. The identities of the two ICE agents involved in the surgery center detention were not released.

The Trump administration deported eight migrants to South Sudan, according to a Department of Homeland Security official, after the administration had to halt their deportation to a base in Djibouti.

""A district judge cannot dictate the national security and foreign policy of the United States of America,"" Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said to ABC News. ""This Independence Day marks another victory for the safety and security of the American people.""

The plane landed in South Sudan just before midnight EST on Friday.

The eight migrants, who DHS has alleged have serious criminal convictions, were the subject of a lawsuit that had halted their deportation to South Sudan and diverted them to a U.S. military base in Djibouti.

The conditions at the base, according to court filings, were both challenging for the detainees and ICE officials who were tasked with watching them.

The lawsuit made it all the way up to the Supreme Court and the court ruled that the Trump administration was not bound by a lower court order to keep them at a military facility in Djibouti.

In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court on Thursday clarified that the noncitizens the Trump administration moved to deport to South Sudan -- and has since held temporarily in Djibouti in legal limbo -- is not bound by a lower court order to keep them there as legal proceedings play out.

The decision is another win for the Trump administration and its unprecedented effort to deport immigrants to countries with which they have no ties and where they may face mistreatment.

In an unsigned opinion, the Supreme Court explained that when it lifted judge-imposed due process requirements for third-country removals last month the government can no longer be held to account for allegedly violating the requirements.

One of the lawyers representing the group of men called their deportation to South Sudan ""punitive and unconstitutional.""

""Because of the Supreme Court's procedural ruling, these men were denied an opportunity to contest their deportations to South Sudan based on their fear of torture or death,"" said Trina Realmuto in a statement to ABC News. ""The U.S. State Department warns Americans against all travel to South Sudan yet deported these men there without any due process.

As President Donald Trump marks six months into his second term, Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told ABC News’ ""This Week"" co-anchor Martha Raddatz that the administration's immigration crackdown has not only sparked protests, but fear among the city's residents.

“Los Angeles is a city of immigrants -- 3.8 million people, and about 50% of our population is Latino. And so when the raids started, fear spread,” Bass said.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids started in Los Angeles early June, prompting demonstrations that at times turned violent. While Trump’s deportation push was initially said to be centered around undocumented immigrants with criminal records, an ABC News analysis of new data shows that in recent weeks, the Trump administration has arrested an increasing number of migrants with no criminal convictions.

Since then, farmers, business owners and immigrant advocacy groups have, like the mayor, said that many residents have been afraid to leave their homes for fear of deportation, affecting the workforce, food supply and the culture of the city. Bass said that the restaurant the interview took place in, located in the predominantly Latino Boyle Heights neighborhood of east Los Angeles, was typically bustling. But now, it — and the neighborhood overall — can feel like a ghost town.

“It's not just the deportation. It's the fear that sets in when raids occur, when people are snatched off the street,” Bass said. ""Even people who are here legally, even people who are U.S. Citizens, have been detained. Immigrants who have their papers and were showing up for their annual immigration appointment were detained when they showed up doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing.""

She criticized ICE for agents for executing enforcement operations without their affiliation being prominently displayed.

“Masked men in unmarked cars, no license plate, no real uniforms, jumping out of cars with rifles, and snatching people off the street, leading a lot of people to think maybe kidnappings were taking place,"" Bass said. ""How do you have masked men who then say, 'Well, we are federal officials,' with no identification?”

Raddatz noted that administration says those agents do that because ""there have been threats... [and] doxing.""

""We have a Los Angeles police department that has to deal with crime in this city every single day. And they're not masked. They stay here,"" Bass said. ""The masked men parachute in, stay here for a while, and leave. And so you enter a profession like policing, like law enforcement? I'm sorry, I don't think you have a right to have a mask and snatch people off the street.""

Bass also touched on the continued presence of federal troops in the city. In response to those protests in early June, Trump deployed the National Guard and active-duty Marines to Los Angeles after protesters clashed with police. Some protestors threw rocks, fireworks and other objects at police, according to reports, before the arrival of federal troops.

Trump signed a memorandum in June saying the National Guard was deployed to address lawlessness in Los Angeles. The California National Guard's 79th Infantry Brigade Combat Team posted on X that its objective was to protect federal protesters and personnel.

In her interview with ABC News, Bass denounced the violence as “terrible,” but said it did not ""warrant military intervention.""

“It did not warrant the Marines coming into our city with basically no real mission, but just to show a force,” Bass said.

While the number of National Guard members in the city has been cut roughly in half, Bass said that their objective has not changed since they first arrived — and argued they're presence is still not necessary.

“If you drive by our two federal buildings, you will see them standing out there. But there's nothing going on in those federal buildings. So in my opinion, we are misusing taxpayers' dollars, and we are misusing our troops,” she said.

While she disagreed strongly with the Trump administration’s immigration agenda, Bass said she appreciated the help the administration gave Los Angeles during the massive January wildfires.

“Well, I will heap praise on the administration for the first six months in Los Angeles with the fires. If you ask me, is there anything that they have done good in terms of immigration? I don't know. I don't think so,” she said. ""I think that the viewpoint has been punitive, has been let's make it as miserable as possible so that these people don't come.""

Bass said that she is still willing to “work” with the White House, noting both the Olympics and World Cup coming to the city over the next few years.

""How does this end?"" Raddatz asked. ""How do you see the next six months, the next two years for immigrants in your city?""“Well, I am just hoping that this reign of terror ends. I'm hoping that the military leaves, because they were never needed here to begin with. I'm hoping that we can get back to normal. I'm hoping that the next time I come to this restaurant, that it will be filled, because people won't be afraid to come here,” Bass said.",NewsAPI,-3.01,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/abc-news-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.71,"abc news, ABC News, abcnews.com, ABC, abcnews  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/,https://ground.news/interest/abc-news_409efb,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.1),USA,,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,The Walt Disney Company,1945,-1.42,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,abcnews.go.com,,abc news,22,USA,Y,G,ABC News,
549,87,Joe Rogan Feels Trump Betrayed Him on Immigration,https://gizmodo.com/joe-rogan-feels-trump-betrayed-him-on-immigration-2000624426,2025-07-05T13:45:09Z,Gizmodo.com,US,deportation,"Joe Rogan, one of the most influential voices in American media, is turning on Donald Trump. And the reason cuts deep: immigration raids.

Rogan, who endorsed Trump just hours before the 2024 presidential election, now says he was misled by the man he helped boost into office. The podcaster and UFC commentator, known for giving a platform to anti-cancel culture figures and free speech advocates, is now accusing Trump of betraying the very values he campaigned on.

“We were told there would be…,” Rogan began during a July 2 episode of The Joe Rogan Experience, before trailing off and recalibrating. “There’s two things that are insane. One is the targeting of migrant workers, not cartel members, not gang members, not drug dealers, just construction workers showing up at construction sites, raiding them. Gardeners. Like, really?”

His guest, Amjad Masad, the Palestinian founder and CEO of the coding platform Replit, agreed. The two were discussing the Trump administration’s crackdown on immigrants, especially in the context of escalating tensions over Gaza and political speech on U.S. campuses.

Masad brought up recent reports of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) targeting Palestinian students and immigrants on flimsy pretenses. “Did you see the video of the Turkish student at Tufts University who wrote an essay?” he asked.

Rogan responded, incredulous: “It was just critical of Israel, right? And that’s enough to get you kicked out of the country?”

The two were referencing growing concern that lawful political speech, especially criticism of Israel, is increasingly being used as grounds for visa cancellations and deportations under Trump’s revived immigration policy.

Rogan’s Endorsement and Regret

Back on November 4, 2024, Rogan endorsed Trump on social media, just before the election. It was a powerful signal to his massive base of male followers.

“The great and powerful @elonmusk. If it wasn’t for him we’d be fucked,” Rogan wrote at the time. “He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you’ll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way. For the record, yes, that’s an endorsement of Trump.”

The post racked up more than 50 million views. But less than a year later, Rogan seems to be reconsidering.

The great and powerful @elonmusk.

If it wasn't for him we'd be fucked. He makes what I think is the most compelling case for Trump you'll hear, and I agree with him every step of the way.

For the record, yes, that's an endorsement of Trump.

While he made clear he would never vote for Kamala Harris, Rogan now feels duped. The immigration policy he thought would focus on violent criminals has instead become a broader crackdown on immigrant communities, including legal residents, students, and workers.

From America First to Raids and Fear

During the campaign, Trump vowed mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, but insisted the focus would be on criminals and gang members. His rallies featured mugshots of alleged MS-13 members and claims that his plan would “clean up the streets.”

But now that he’s back in the White House, reality looks different. According to recent court filings and ICE data, many of the people being arrested or deported have no criminal records at all.

That discrepancy is what’s pushing Rogan to speak out. He’s built his brand around authenticity and free speech. Trump’s current approach, he suggests, smells more like authoritarianism than policy.

“Fascism is the response almost always to communism,” Rogan said on the same podcast, quoting ANthony Rispo, a student of psychology and neuroscience at Columbia University. “What we experience in this country is this continual overcorrection. Overcorrection to the left, then overcorrection to the right, to counter that.”

In other words, Rogan is wondering if Trump’s policies are an overcorrection too far, and if they resemble fascism more than freedom.

Musk, DOGE, and the Fracture of the Bro Alliance

Rogan’s disillusionment mirrors that of Elon Musk, another former Trump ally. Musk, who headed the now-infamous Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), has become one of Trump’s fiercest critics since Congress passed the “One Big Beautiful Bill,” a legislation that slashed EV subsidies, immigration protections, and environmental incentives.

Musk is now threatening to start a third political party. And while Trump can afford to ignore the Tesla CEO’s rebellion, he can’t easily brush off Joe Rogan. Why? Because they share the same audience: disaffected men, anti-establishment voters, young libertarians, and people tired of traditional politics.

If that group is forced to choose between Trump and Rogan, the outcome could significantly impact the 2026 midterm elections and future political landscapes.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,

Twenty-four Hmong men who settled in Minnesota decades ago are being held in jails across Minnesota and Iowa as they await deportation to Laos, according to the Hmong 18 Council , a local Hmong advocacy group. Most of the men arrived in the U.S. as refugees after the Vietnam War and later became lawful permanent residents before their status was revoked due to past criminal convictions. Federal agents arrested several individuals at their homes, workplaces and in front of their children.

The detentions have caused distress and confusion within Minnesota’s Hmong community. Family members often do not know where their loved ones are being held or when removal proceedings might occur. Chia Neng Vue, 43, who was arrested at his home in Coon Rapids, told the Sahan Journal , “It is a tear in my heart. I am scared for my children and my family. I do not know what will happen to us.”

Community advocates warn that these enforcement actions reflect a broader pattern targeting Southeast Asian Americans and are calling for greater transparency from immigration authorities. Darling Yaj, executive director of the Hmong 18 Council, said, “To the Hmong community, this is a betrayal. We came here as legal immigrants, not illegally.” Advocates are urging officials to consider the men’s long-standing ties to Minnesota and the trauma caused by uprooting families with deep roots in the region.

A few weeks ago, Barakzai, an Afghan refugee, noticed that her usually friendly coworkers at a clothing store in the Iranian capital, Tehran, began treating her differently. They became cold and distant, she says.

""They don't view Afghans the way they used to. They see Afghans as enemies,"" she says. ""They tell us: ''You are a spy. Our government is right. You should be fired.'""

We are identifying Barakzai by her last name only to protect her identity because she is still in Iran and fears deportation.

Earlier this year, Iran ordered Afghans living illegally in the country to leave, saying it can no longer support them. Of the roughly 6 million Afghans living in Iran, 2 million are without legal status.

Since then, more than 1.3 million Afghans have returned to Afghanistan, according to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Iran has redoubled its effort since last month's Israel-Iran war, Barakzai says, using disinformation to label Afghans as Israeli spies to help its goal of removing thousands from the country.

The government campaign has also targeted Afghans' housing, employment and banking.

""They don't allow Afghans to withdraw their money from the banks, or have the right to work,"" she says. ""They even said that anyone who employed Afghans would be imprisoned and even fined. And they forced landlords to stop renting to Afghans.""

The immigration raids in public spaces have terrified Afghans.

""At the metro station, I saw the police take Afghan men and beat the women,"" Barakzai says. ""I couldn't raise my voice, because I was in danger myself. Right now, I pretend I am not Afghan, so that no one will recognize me.""

The public raids have had a desired effect: Thousands of Afghans are heading every day from Iran to Afghanistan through the Islam Qala border crossing between the two countries. Some arrive in buses and are offloaded at the border; others pack up on their own and leave.

""We went from 5,000 people a day to 30[000], 40[000], and even on some days, 50,000 people coming back per day from Iran,"" says Arafat Jamal, the UNHCR representative in Kabul. ""What surprised us at the moment is the sheer scale and in particular the intensity of returns from Iran.""

Samira Sayed Rahman, the advocacy director for Save the Children in Afghanistan, says some people arrive at the crossing wearing one shoe because they lost the other in a deportation raid.

""The lucky ones have had to pack up their lives overnight,"" she says. ""Others have had to leave with just the clothes on their back.""

The crisis within Afghanistan

Iran isn't the only country expelling Afghans. Afghans are coming back also from Pakistan and, most recently, Tajikistan.

""What we're facing at the moment is really a crisis on three borders,"" says UNHCR's Jamal.

Accommodating more than 1.6 million people returning from all those countries has presented an enormous challenge to Afghanistan. A 2024 United Nations report found that 23.7 million people — over half of the population — required humanitarian assistance last year.

It's likely to get worse: In addition, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio terminated all but two State Department and USAID programs in Afghanistan, one of which expired at the end of June. In total, 22 programs worth nearly $1.03 billion were shuttered, according to the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction. Aid workers say they fear the returnees refugees will make the challenge more pressing.

""Many families already in Afghanistan can barely feed their own children,"" Rahman says. ""And now they're also being asked to help absorb thousands, millions more.""

In addition to cuts in U.S. foreign aid, a high unemployment rate has further pushed people into poverty. Banking restrictions and sanctions have put pressures on business. The loss of remittances from expatriate workers, a vital part of Afghanistan's economy, is also hurting.

""Even those in the private sector have been struggling to create jobs, struggling to do imports and exports because of the banking restrictions that are in place,"" Rahman says.

Those returning have more questions than answers.

""They didn't know how they were going to be able to feed their family,"" Rahman says. ""Where are they going to establish themselves? They were scared.""

A New Reality

Many Afghan women returning to Afghanistan face a new and restrictive government that doesn't allow them to work, study or even go outside unaccompanied.

""Certainly for the women…the girls have been through schooling and they are really in a state of shock,"" Jamal, the UNHCR representative, says.

Jamshidi, 24, is one such woman. We are only using her last name to protect her identity because of fear of reprisals from the Taliban. Four years ago, she was forced to interrupt her education at Herat University in Afghanistan when the Taliban came to power and banned schooling for women. She fled to Iran to continue her education. As she was about to graduate with a degree in political science from Ferdowsi University of Mashhad in Iran, the war between Israel and Iran broke out. She had to leave again.

""It was very difficult psychologically, because I was planning on getting a bachelor's degree and thinking what kind of work to do,"" she says. ""And then there is war there and you have to go back to your own country. It hurt us a lot.""

The UNHCR estimates that if the rate of returnees continues, it will reach 3 million Afghans by the end of the year.

Back in Tehran, Barakzai, the Afghan woman who is staying on in Iran, is trying to leave her apartment as little as possible to avoid deportation.

""The real war,"" she says, ""is not between Iran and Israel, it's between Iran and the Afghan refugees.""",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,
552,269,Trump: I won’t deport illegal migrants — if they work on farms,https://uk.news.yahoo.com/trump-ll-spare-undocumented-farm-171142437.html,2025-07-04T17:11:42Z,Yahoo Entertainment,US,deportation,"Donald Trump said he will spare undocumented farm workers from deportation if their bosses can vouch for them.

The US president floated the idea for the exemptions, which could also apply to hotel and restaurant workers, during a visit to Iowa.

Legislation is already being drafted for the carve-out how to deal with undocumented agricultural workers with Kristi Noem, the homeland security secretary.

“You know, they’ve had people working for them for years. And we’re going to do something … we’re going to sort of put the farmers in charge,” he said on Thursday night.

“If a farmer has been with one of these people that worked so hard – they bend over all day, we don’t have too many people that can do that, but they work very hard, and they know him very well, and some of the farmers are literally, you know, they cry when they see this happen.

“If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people, in some way, Kristi, I think we’re going to have to just say that’s going to be good, right?”

Mr Trump was repeating remarks he made earlier in the week.

Underpinning the proposed exemptions is a dispute within the administration, with Brooke Rollins, the agriculture secretary, pushing for concessions for farmers and their workers, while immigration hardliner and White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller strongly opposes any concessions.

At one point, raids on farms, meatpacking plants and restaurants were paused.

But they were resumed again after immigration hawks, including Mr Miller and Ms Noem, leaned on the president.

Mr Trump’s remarks this week suggest that he could be leaning towards backing his agriculture secretary after all.

According to the Centre for Migration Studies, there are around 283,000 undocumented farm workers in the US, with nearly half being employed in California; other estimates put the figure even higher.

More than 80 per cent come from Mexico, with the remainder hailing from Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Nicaragua.

Agriculture industry hit by deportation drive

The Trump deportation drive has wrought havoc on the agriculture industry. Fearful of being picked up by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as many as 70 per cent of farm workers in some parts of the country have been staying away.

This has led to crops rotting in fields and labour shortages at meat-packing facilities.

“We do not have enough workforce in the United States to do manual work, to do those jobs that other people are not qualified to do and do not want to do,” Alexandra Sossa, chief executive of Farmworker and Landscaper Advocacy Project, told Newsweek.

“For example, we are running into a problem where we do not have enough farm workers to grow the food we eat every day.”

According to Farmonaut, an agriculture technology company, the stricter immigration polices are creating a labour shortage, which is putting up food prices.

There is similar pressure on the hospitality industry, with hotels and restaurants heavily dependent on immigrant labour.

Even Mr Trump’s Mar-a-Lago has imported foreign workers, with Department of Labour statistics showing that it applied for 136 H-2B visas for non-agricultural workers in 2023.

Trump urged to fix long-term labour issues

“We are encouraged that the president recognises the valuable contributions farmworkers play in America’s food security,” John Walt Boatright, director of Government Affairs for the American Farm Bureau Federation told The Telegraph

“Farmers support a secure border and safe communities, and they also understand that without a stable workforce, it’s not possible to get food from the farm to the tables of America’s families.”

“We have not seen specifics on President Trump’s plans, but we urge him and Congress to address long-term agriculture labour issues by revising overreaching regulations, modernising current guestworker programmes to allow for year-round access to employees, and fixing outdated wage rate calculations that put help out of reach for many farmers.”

While the administration is willing to make concessions for these key groups of workers, there will be no let-up in ICE’s activities.

Within days of the announcement of an “Alligator Alcatraz” to house deportees in Florida, Alaska, albeit tongue in cheek, suggested its large bear population could do a similar job in the frozen north.

553,178,The IRS Is Building a Vast System to Share Millions of Taxpayers’ Data With ICE,https://www.propublica.org/article/trump-irs-share-tax-records-ice-dhs-deportations,2025-07-15T15:52:10Z,ProPublica,US,deportation,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published.

The Internal Revenue Service is building a computer program that would give deportation officers unprecedented access to confidential tax data.

ProPublica has obtained a blueprint of the system, which would create an “on demand” process allowing Immigration and Customs Enforcement to obtain the home addresses of people it’s seeking to deport.

Last month, in a previously undisclosed dispute, the acting general counsel at the IRS, Andrew De Mello, refused to turn over the addresses of 7.3 million taxpayers sought by ICE. In an email obtained by ProPublica, De Mello said he had identified multiple legal “deficiencies” in the agency’s request.

Two days later, on June 27, De Mello was forced out of his job, people familiar with the dispute said. The addresses have not yet been released to ICE. De Mello did not respond to requests for comment, and the administration did not address questions sent by ProPublica about his departure.

The Department of Government Efficiency began pushing the IRS to provide taxpayer data to immigration agents soon after President Donald Trump took office. The tax agency’s acting general counsel refused and was replaced by De Mello, who Trump administration officials viewed as more willing to carry out the president’s agenda. Soon after, the Department of Homeland Security, ICE’s parent agency, and the IRS negotiated a “memorandum of understanding” that included specific legal guardrails to safeguard taxpayers’ private information.

In his email, De Mello said ICE’s request for millions of records did not meet those requirements, which include having a written assurance that each taxpayer whose address is being sought was under active criminal investigation.

“There’s just no way ICE has 7 million real criminal investigations, that’s a fantasy,” said a former senior IRS official who had been advising the agency on this issue. The demands from the DHS were “unprecedented,” the official added, saying the agency was pressing the IRS to do what amounted to “a big data dump.”

In the past, when law enforcement sought IRS data to support its investigations, agencies would give the IRS the full legal name of the target, an address on file and an explanation of why the information was relevant to a criminal inquiry. Such requests rarely involved more than a dozen people at a time, former IRS officials said.

Danny Werfel, IRS commissioner during the Biden administration, said the privacy laws allowing federal investigators to obtain taxpayer data have never “been read to open the door to the sharing of thousands, tens of thousands, or hundreds of thousands of tax records for a broad-based enforcement initiative.”

A spokesperson for the White House said the planned use of IRS data was legal and a means of fulfilling Trump’s campaign pledge to carry out mass deportations of “illegal criminal aliens.”

Taxpayer data is among the most confidential in the federal government and is protected by strict privacy laws, which have historically limited its transfer to law enforcement and other government agencies. Unauthorized disclosure of taxpayer return information is a felony that can carry a penalty of up to five years in prison.

The system that the IRS is now creating would give ICE automated access to home addresses en masse, limiting the ability of IRS officials to consider the legality of transfers. IRS insiders who reviewed a copy of the blueprint said it could result in immigration agents raiding wrong or outdated addresses.

“If this program is implemented in its current form, it’s extremely likely that incorrect addresses will be given to DHS and individuals will be wrongly targeted,” said an IRS engineer who examined the blueprints and who, like other officials, spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution.

The dispute that ended in De Mello’s ouster was the culmination of months of pressure on the IRS to turn over massive amounts of data in ways that would redefine the relationship between the agency and law enforcement and reduce taxpayers’ privacy, records and interviews show.

In one meeting in late March between senior IRS and DHS officials, a top ICE official made a suggestion: Why doesn’t Homeland Security simply provide the name and state of its targets and have the IRS return the addresses of everyone who matches that criteria?

The IRS lawyers were stunned. They feared they could face criminal liability if they handed over the addresses of individuals who were not under a criminal investigation. The conversation and news of deeper collaboration with ICE so disturbed career staff that it led to a series of departures in late March and early April across the IRS’ legal, IT and privacy offices.

They were “pushing the boundaries of the law,” one official said. “Everyone at IRS felt the same way.”

The Blueprint

The technical blueprint obtained by ProPublica shows that engineers at the agency are preparing to give DHS what it wants: a system that enables massive automated data sharing. The goal is to launch the new system before the end of July, two people familiar with the matter said.

The DHS effort to obtain IRS data comes as top immigration enforcement leaders face escalating White House pressure to deport some 3,000 people per day, according to reports.

One federal agent tasked with assisting ICE on deportations said recent operations have been hamstrung by outdated addresses. Better information could dramatically speed up arrests. “Some of the leads that they were giving us were old,” said the agent, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak with the press. “They’re like from two administrations ago.”

In early March, immigrants rights groups sued the IRS hoping to block the plan, arguing that the memorandum of understanding between DHS and the IRS is illegal. But a judge in early May ruled against them, saying the broader agreement complied with Section 6103, the existing law regulating IRS data sharing. That opened the door for engineers to begin building the system.

The judge did not address the technical blueprint, which didn’t exist at the time of the ruling. But the case is pending, which means the new system could still come under legal review.

Until now, little was known about the push and pull between the two agencies or the exact technical mechanics behind the arrangement.

The plan has been shrouded in secrecy even within the IRS, with details of its development withheld from regular communications. Several IRS engineers and lawyers have avoided working on the project out of concerns about personal legal risk.

Asked about the new system, a spokesperson for IRS parent agency the Treasury Department said the memorandum of understanding, often called an MOU, “has been litigated and determined to be a lawful application of Section 6103, which provides for information sharing by the IRS in precise circumstances associated with law enforcement requests.”

At a time when Trump is making threats to deport not only undocumented immigrants but also U.S. citizens, the scope of information-sharing with the IRS could continue to grow, according to documents reviewed by ProPublica and sources familiar with the matter: DHS has been looking for ways to expand the agreement that could allow Homeland Security officials to seek IRS data on Americans being investigated for various crimes.

Last month, an ICE attorney proposed updating the MOU to authorize new data requests on people “associated with criminal activities which may include United States citizens or lawful permanent residents,” according to a document seen by ProPublica. The status of this proposal is unclear. De Mello, at the time, rejected it and called for senior Treasury Department leadership to personally sign off on such a significant change.

The White House described DHS’ work with the IRS as a good-faith effort to identify and deport those who are living in the country illegally.

“ProPublica continues to degrade their already terrible reputation by suggesting we should turn a blind eye to criminal illegal aliens present in the United States for the sake of trying to collect tax payments from them,” White House spokesperson Abigail Jackson said in a statement after receiving questions about the blueprint from ProPublica.

She pointed to the April MOU as giving the government the authority to create the new system and added, “This isn’t a surveillance system. … It’s part of President Trump’s promise to carry out the mass deportation of criminal illegal aliens — the promise that the American people elected him on and he is committed to fulfilling.”

In a separate statement, a senior DHS official also cited the court’s approval of the MOU, saying that it “outlines a process to ensure that sensitive taxpayer information is protected while allowing law enforcement to effectively pursue criminal violations.”

How the System Works

The new system would represent a sea change, allowing law enforcement to request enormous swaths of confidential data in bulk through an automated, computerized process.

The system, according to the blueprint and interviews with IRS engineers, would work like this:

First, DHS would send the IRS a spreadsheet containing the names and previous addresses of the people it’s targeting. The request would include the date of a final removal order, a relevant criminal statute ICE is using to investigate the individual, and the tax period for which information is sought. If DHS fails to include any of this information, the system would reject the request.

The system then attempts to match the information provided by the DHS to a specific taxpayer identification number, which is the primary method by which the IRS identifies an individual in its databases.

If the system makes a match, it accesses the individual’s associated tax file and pulls the address listed during the most recent tax period. Then the system would produce a new spreadsheet enriched with taxpayer data that contains DHS’ targets’ last known addresses. The spreadsheet would include a record of names rejected for lack of required information and names for which it could not make a match.

Tax and privacy experts say they worry about how such a powerful yet crude platform could make dangerous mistakes. Because the search starts with a name instead of a taxpayer identification number, it risks returning the address of an innocent person with the same name as or a similar address to that of one of ICE’s targets. The proposed system assumes the data provided by DHS is accurate and that each targeted individual is the subject of a valid criminal investigation. In effect, the IRS has no way to independently check the bases of these requests, experts told ProPublica.

In addition, the blueprint does not limit the amount of data that can be transferred or how often DHS can request it. The system could easily be expanded to acquire all the information the IRS holds on taxpayers, said technical experts and IRS engineers who reviewed the documents. By shifting a single parameter, the program could return more information than just a target’s address, said an engineer familiar with the plan, including employer and familial relationships.

Engineers based at IRS offices in Lanham, Maryland, and Dallas are developing the blueprint.

“Gone Back on Its Word”

For decades, the American government has encouraged everyone who makes an income in the U.S. to pay taxes — regardless of immigration status — with an implicit promise that their information would be protected. Now that same data may be used to locate and deport noncitizens.

“For years, the IRS has told immigrants that it only cares that they pay their taxes,” said Nandan Joshi, an attorney with the Public Citizen Litigation Group, which is seeking to block the data-sharing agreement in federal court. “By agreeing to share taxpayer data with ICE on a mass basis, the IRS has gone back on its word.”

The push to share IRS data with DHS emerged while Elon Musk’s DOGE reshaped the engineering staff of the IRS. Sam Corcos, a Silicon Valley startup founder with no government experience, pushed out more than 50 IRS engineers and restructured the agency’s engineering priorities while he was the senior DOGE official at the agency. He later became chief information officer at Treasury. He has also led a separate IRS effort to create a master database using products from Silicon Valley giant Palantir Technologies, enabling the government to link and search large swaths of data.

Corcos didn’t respond to a request for comment. The White House said DOGE is not part of the DHS-IRS pact.

Sen. Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Finance, which oversees the IRS, told ProPublica the system being built was ripe for abuse. It “would allow an outside agency unprecedented access to IRS records for reasons that have nothing to do with tax administration, opening the door to endless fishing expeditions,” he said.

The Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the department’s internal watchdog, is already probing efforts by Trump and DOGE to obtain private taxpayer data and other sensitive information, ProPublica reported in April.

The Trump administration continues to add government agencies to its deportation drive.

DOGE and DHS are also working to build a national citizenship database, NPR reported last month. The database links information from the Social Security Administration and the DHS, ostensibly for the purpose of allowing state and local election officials to verify U.S. citizenship.

A longtime business owner in Peoria, Arizona, is facing deportation after more than two decades of living and working in the U.S. Kelly Yu, who owns Kawaii Sushi, a well-known restaurant in the city, was detained by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) after a routine immigration check-in in late May.

Yu, who does not have legal status in the U.S. and has no criminal record, now remains in ICE custody in Arizona, separated from her family, business and loyal customers.

Community response

Friends, employees and longtime customers have launched petitions and organized social media campaigns calling for Yu’s release. Supporters describe her as hardworking and generous, crediting her with building a welcoming space for residents and visitors. Due to Yu’s absence, her restaurant is currently operating under the management of relatives and staff.

Rep. Greg Stanton described Yu’s case as heartbreaking and said he was denied entry when he tried to visit her at the ICE facility. In a public statement, Stanton said, “People like Yu facing deportation is [sic] the reason that the immigration system needs reform.” U.S. Sen. Ruben Gallego, who also condemned Yu’s detainment, said he is “going to look at everything I can do to help her.” Local supporters continue to draw attention to Yu’s contributions and are urging immigration officials to reconsider her case.

Legal process

ICE officials confirmed that Yu is being processed under current immigration law. Her legal team has filed appeals, while her supporters continue to press for her release. Her status and any potential hearings remain pending as her family, employees and supporters continue to monitor developments while her legal proceedings move forward.

Weeks after being released from immigration detention, Mahmoud Khalil, a key negotiator and spokesperson during Columbia University's pro-Palestinian campus protests, has filed an administrative complaint against the Trump administration seeking $20 million in damages.

Khalil, who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more than three months as the Trump administration pushed for his deportation, alleges false arrest and imprisonment, malicious prosecution, intentional infliction of emotional distress and other alleged wrongdoings.

The complaint, a precursor to a federal lawsuit, was filed under the Federal Tort Claims Act.

According to the Center for Constitutional Rights, the organization representing Khalil, the Columbia graduate would use the money to “help others similarly targeted by the Trump administration and Columbia University.”

In a press release, the organization said: “He would accept, in lieu of payment, an official apology and abandonment of the administration’s unconstitutional policy.""

Khalil, 30, helped lead and negotiate on behalf of the pro-Palestinian encampments that spread at Columbia during the spring of 2024, amid the Israel-Hamas war.

Khalil, a green card holder married to a U.S. citizen, was detained by ICE agents in his New York apartment building in March -- the first high-profile pro-Palestinian activist to be detained by ICE during the administration of President Donald Trump, who had vowed to ""crush"" the campus protests, calling them hotbeds of antisemitism.

Khalil was transferred to an ICE facility in Louisiana, while the Trump administration pressed in court for his deportation.

The Trump administration said Khalil was detained for his purported support of Hamas -- a claim his legal team has rejected and for which the administration provided no evidence.

In court proceedings earlier this year, Secretary of State Marco Rubio -- citing a rarely used provision of the law -- determined Khalil should be deported because his continued presence in the country would pose a risk to U.S. foreign policy.

An immigration judge in Louisiana initially found Khalil deportable, but a federal judge in New Jersey later issued an order barring the Trump administration from deporting or continuing to detain Khalil on that basis.

Khalil was released from custody on June 20, but the Trump administration is continuing to seek his deportation.

Khalil's complaint also accuses the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security and ICE of conducting a “retaliatory arrest” against Khalil over his constitutionally protected speech.

""Officials at the highest levels of the United States government publicly lashed out at Mr. Khalil on social media, falsely labeling him a terrorist sympathizer and an anti-semite — derogatory charges designed to destroy Mr. Khalil’s reputation, put him in physical danger and cause extreme emotional distress,” the complaint stated.

In a statement to ABC News, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the Trump administration acted within its legal and constitutional authority to detain Khalil.

""Mahmoud Khalil's claim that DHS officials branded him as an antisemite and terrorized him and his family is absurd,"" McLaughlin said in the statement. ""It was Khalil who terrorized Jewish students on campus. He ‘branded’ himself as antisemite through his own hateful behavior and rhetoric.

In late May, Iran said undocumented Afghans must leave the country by July 6, potentially impacting four million people out of the around six million Afghans Tehran says live in the country.

Numbers of people crossing the border have surged since mid-June, with some days seeing around 40,000 people crossing at Islam Qala in western Herat province, UN agencies have said.

From June 1 to July 5, 449,218 Afghans returned from Iran, a spokesman for the International Organization for Migration told AFP on Monday, adding that the total for the year so far was 906,326.

Many people crossing reported pressure from authorities or arrest and deportation, as well as losing already limited finances in the rush to leave quickly.

Massive foreign aid cuts have impacted the response to the crisis, with the UN, international non-governmental groups and Taliban officials calling for more funding to support the returnees.

The UN has warned the influx could destabilise the country already grappling with entrenched poverty, unemployment and climate change-related shocks and urged nations not to forcibly return Afghans.

""Forcing or pressuring Afghans to return risks further instability in the region, and onward movement towards Europe,"" the UN refugees agency UNHCR said in a statement on Friday.

557,17,Kilmar Ábrego García alleges torture and abuse in El Salvador mega-jail,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq7nxkpkp4o,2025-07-03T15:05:40Z,BBC News,US,deportation,"Kilmar Ábrego García alleges torture and abuse in El Salvador prison

Kilmar Ábrego García was returned to the US in June to face human trafficking charges

While officials initially said Mr Ábrego García could never return to the US, in June he was extradited to Tennessee to face human trafficking charges - to which he has pleaded not guilty.

The Trump administration had previously alleged Mr Ábrego García was a member of the Salvadorian gang, MS-13, which his lawyers and family have strongly denied.

Lawyers for Kilmar Ábrego García, 29, alleged that assaults from guards within a day of his arrival at the CECOT prison left him with visible injuries.

A Maryland man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador and detained in one of that country's most notorious prisons was subjected to ""severe beatings"" and ""torture"", new court documents allege.

According to new court documents filed on Wednesday as part of a lawsuit his wife brought against the Trump administration, Mr Ábrego García and 20 other detainees were repeatedly beaten when they arrived at El Salvador's Terrorism Confinement Centre, or Cecot.

Once there, according to the documents, Mr Ábrego García and 20 other deported inmates ""were confined to metal bunks with no mattresses in an overcrowded cell with no windows, bright lights that remained on 24 hours a day, and minimal access to sanitation"".

Mr Ábrego García has also alleged that he and the other prisoners were ""forced to kneel"" from 9 PM to 6 AM, ""with guards striking anyone who fell from exhaustion"".

At one point, guards allegedly threatened to confine him with gang members who would ""tear"" him apart.

His mistreatment led to him losing 30lbs (14kg) within the first two weeks of his incarceration in El Salvador, according to the complaint.

El Salvador's President Nayib Bukele has previously said his country's prisons are ""clean, orderly, free from abuses, unsanitary conditions, beatings, or murders"".

During a visit to the White House earlier this year, he expressed support for the Trump administration's deportation agenda.

The Trump administration has asked the federal judge in Maryland overseeing the case to dismiss the lawsuit, arguing that it was overtaken by events after Mr Ábrego García was returned to the US. The lawsuit was filed by Mr Ábrego García's wife after his deportation.

Mr Ábrego García first entered the US illegally in 2011 and was granted protection from deportation by an immigration judge in 2019 because it was determined he might face danger from gangs if returned to his native El Salvador.

But in March 2025 the Maryland resident was deported and initially held in El Salvador's Cecot mega-prison, in what Trump administration officials later admitted was a mistake. A judge ordered the government to ""facilitate"" his return, but White House officials initially refused to bring him back.

Following his return to face charges in June, Attorney General Pam Bondi said that ""this is what American justice looks like"".

He has denied any wrongdoing, and his attorneys have called the trafficking charges ""preposterous"".

In late June, a federal judge in Tennessee ruled that Mr Ábrego García is eligible for release, but he has remained in jail over fears from his own legal team that he could be swiftly deported again if he leaves the facility.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,

Kilmar Abrego Garcia's legal team asked a judge at a hearing Friday to order that he not be removed from the United States without at least 72 hours notice should he be released on bond from detention in Tennessee.

On Day 3 of a hearing in Maryland on the government's plans for the longtime Maryland resident this week, U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis repeatedly blasted the government for what she said was an insufficient effort to address what exactly will be done to ensure due process for Abrego Garcia if he's taken into ICE custody following his release.

""We're asking for 72 hours, 72 hours notice, so that my client can have an opportunity to run to whatever is the appropriate court at that moment to get relief before he's shipped off to an as-yet-unidentified country and he's potentially subject to torture or persecution in violation of a court order. That's all we're asking,"" Abrego Garcia's attorney told the judge.

The judge did not rule from the bench but said she would do so soon.

Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran native, was deported in March to El Salvador's CECOT mega-prison -- despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution -- after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which he denies.

He was brought back to the U.S. last month to face charges in Tennessee of allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. while he was living in Maryland. He has pleaded not guilty.

Government attorneys have said that, should Abrego Garcia be released on bond, he could be deported again, but Abrego Garcia's legal team has argued he should be transferred from Tennessee to Maryland to await trial.

Judge Xinis, however, acknowledged the government's position that there's no ICE detention facility in Maryland.

The judge also said that restoring the status quo would mean returning Abrego Garcia to Maryland as that's where ""he was arrested in Baltimore without any proof"" -- but the government argued that his removal process started in Texas when he was taken into ICE custody.

""We may have a disagreement on what the status quo is, Your Honor ... with respect, we disagree, but obviously your opinion matters more,"" the DOJ attorney said.

Xinis said she doesn't necessarily think sending Abrego Garcia back to his family in Maryland is the ""proper full relief,"" but added, ""I do know there's a real question in my mind: Does he get the process to start over through Immigration in Maryland?""

The judge also slammed the lack of detailed answers provided by ICE official Thomas Giles during his testimony Thursday, when he was asked to explain the government's plans for Abrego Garcia's deportation.

""The reality is, this has been a process. From Day 1, you have taken the presumption of regularity and you have destroyed it, in my view, because I can't presume anything to be regular in this highly irregular case,"" the judge said at the start of Friday's hearing when a DOJ attorney wasn't able to produce Abrego Garcia's detainer document that she had asked for on Thursday.

The government subsequently produced the document later in the hearing.

Declaring that Giles' testimony ""insults my intelligence,"" Judge Xinis said that getting specific information is critical due to the extraordinary situation in which the government has already wrongfully deported Abrego Garcia once.

""So this -- we're not operating on a clean slate at all,"" she said. ""It seems like this would be the case where you'd want to put a little meat on the bones of exactly how you're going to do this lawfully and constitutionally.""

DOJ attorneys said the government has yet to decide if Abrego Garcia will be removed to a third country or if proceedings to remove him back to El Salvador will be reopened, and that the decision will be made by a case officer once he comes under ICE's custody.

When the government said an ICE case officer will decide how to move forward with Abrego Garcia's deportation process once he's in ICE custody, the judge expressed doubt about the agency's process, saying Abrego Garcia's removal process has been ""altered, all depending on"" the Trump administration's interests.

""That is plainly insufficient to tell me what's going to happen to Mr. Abrego apart from what you would have me believe, which is that we've given this no thought, no conversation, no pre-planning, we're just going to roll the dice on Wednesday or whatever day he's released, if he's released to ICE custody. And I'm just telling you, I'm not buying that,"" Judge Xinis said.

When a DOJ attorney said that's not a fair characterization of the government's position, saying the decision will be made by an ICE officer like all other cases, the judge accepted the answer but remarked that it makes their argument ""weaker.""

Judge Xinis also repeatedly pressed the government on what she described as an ""inconsistent"" policy in its third-country removal process -- comparing a DHS memo from March to an email advisory ICE sent out to its officers earlier this month, the latter of which described the possibility of a person being removed from the U.S. without an opportunity to contest it based on fear of torture or persecution.

A government attorney replied that ""there is no meaningful difference between what's set forth in the March 30, 2025, process and the July 9 process,"" and that should the third-country removal process take place, Abrego Garcia will be given written notice and an opportunity to contest it.",NewsAPI,-3.01,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/abc-news-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.71,"abc news, ABC News, abcnews.com, ABC, abcnews  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/,https://ground.news/interest/abc-news_409efb,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.1),USA,,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,The Walt Disney Company,1945,-1.42,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,abcnews.go.com,,abc news,22,USA,Y,G,ABC News,

The details came in a filing Abrego Garcia's attorneys made Wednesday in their effort to convince Maryland U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis to block his deportation while he awaits trial on human smuggling charges in Tennessee.

Among the details his lawyers sought to include in their original complaint were their client's account of his arrest in March, his detainment in the U.S., and his time in El Salvador, where he was sent despite a 2019 court order barring his deportation to that country due to fear of persecution, after the Trump administration claimed he was a member of the criminal gang MS-13, which he has denied.

Abrego Garcia, according to Wednesday's filing, repeatedly informed officials from the moment he was arrested that ""he was never a gang member"" and that he had legal permission to remain and work in the U.S.

When Abrego Garcia and his fellow detainees arrived at CECOT, a prison official said, ""Welcome to CECOT. Whoever enters here doesn't leave,"" according to the filing. Upon his arrival, Abrego Garcia was ""pushed toward a bus, forcibly seated, and fitted with a second set of chains and handcuffs. He was repeatedly struck by officers when he attempted to raise his head,"" the filing said.

""Plaintiff Abrego Garcia was then forced to strip, issued prison clothing, and subjected to physical abuse including being kicked in the legs with boots and struck on his head and arms to make him change clothes faster,"" his lawyers said.

Abrego Garcia had visible bruises and lumps all over his body, the filing said. He and other Salvadorans were forced to kneel for nine hours, ""with guards striking anyone who fell from exhaustion.""

""The detainees were confined to metal bunks with no mattresses in an overcrowded cell with no windows, bright lights that remained on 24 hours a day, and minimal access to sanitation,"" his lawyers wrote.

In the proposed amended complaint, Abrego Garcia's attorneys allege that Salvadoran authorities ""recognized"" that Abrego Garcia was not affiliated with any gangs, and separated him and 20 other Salvadorans by placing them in a separate cell a week after they arrived at the prison.

The filing says Abrego Garcia lost 31 pounds during his first two weeks at CECOT.

Then, on April 10, Abrego Garcia was transferred to a prison facility in Santa Ana, El Salvador, where he was ""frequently hidden from visitors,"" according to the filing.

Abrego Garcia was brought back to the U.S. last month to face charges in Tennessee of allegedly transporting undocumented migrants within the U.S. while he was living in Maryland. He has pleaded not guilty.

Federal prosecutors in Tennessee have indicated their intention to deport Abrego Garcia to a third country if the magistrate judge overseeing his criminal case releases him on bail as he awaits trial. His attorneys have asked Judge Xinis to order the transfer of Abrego Garcia to Maryland and to block his removal from the U.S. without first providing him and his attorneys notice.

""Defendants have repeatedly stated their intent to remove Mr. Abrego Garcia to a third country,"" his attorneys said Wednesday. ""Abrego Garcia could face persecution or torture if removed directly to various other countries, including but not limited to countries with notorious human rights abuses like Libya, South Sudan, and Eritrea.

""Without knowing which country Defendants intend to try to remove him to, Abrego Garcia cannot prepare or file an application for protection,"" his lawyers said.",NewsAPI,-3.01,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/abc-news-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.71,"abc news, ABC News, abcnews.com, ABC, abcnews  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/abc-news/,https://ground.news/interest/abc-news_409efb,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/abc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),HIGH (1.1),USA,,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,The Walt Disney Company,1945,-1.42,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,abcnews.go.com,,abc news,22,USA,Y,G,ABC News,

561,269,A Tunisian musician was detained in LA after living in US for a decade. His doctor wife speaks out,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/tunisian-musician-detained-la-living-035513539.html,2025-08-02T03:55:13Z,Yahoo Entertainment,US,deportation,"LOS ANGELES (AP) — Dr. Wafaa Alrashid noticed fewer of her patients were showing up for their appointments at the Los Angeles area hospital where she works as immigration raids spread fear among the Latino population she serves.

The Utah-born chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital understood their fear on a personal level. Her husband Rami Othmane, a Tunisian singer and classical musician, began carrying a receipt of his pending green card application around with him.

Over the past few months, immigration agents have arrested hundreds of people in Southern California, prompting protests against the federal raids and the subsequent deployment of the National Guard and Marines. Despite living in the U.S. for a decade as one of thousands of residents married to U.S. citizens, he was swept up in the crackdown.

On July 13, Othmane was stopped while driving to a grocery store in Pasadena. He quickly pulled out his paperwork to show federal immigration agents.

“They didn’t care, they said, ‘Please step out of the car,’” Alrashid recalled hearing the officers say as she watched her husband’s arrest in horror over FaceTime.

Alrashid immediately jumped in her car and followed her phone to his location. She arrived just in time to see the outline of his head in the back of a vehicle driving away.

“That was probably the worst day of my life,"" she said.

The Trump administration's crackdown on illegal immigration has ensnared not only immigrants without legal status but legal permanent residents like Othmane who has green cards. Some U.S. citizens have even been arrested. Meanwhile, many asylum-seekers who have regular check-in appointments are being arrested in the hallways outside courtrooms as the White House works toward its promise of mass deportations.

Alrashid said her husband has been in the U.S. since 2015 and overstayed his visa, but his deportation order was dismissed in 2020. They wed in March 2025 and immediately filed for a green card.

After his arrest, he was taken to the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility in downtown Los Angeles where he was held in a freezing cold room with “no beds, no pillows, no blankets, no soap, no toothbrushes and toothpaste, and when you’re in a room with people, the bathroom’s open,” she said.

The Department of Homeland Security in an emailed statement noted the expiration of his tourist visa but did not address the dismissal of the deportation order in 2020 nor his pending green card application.

The agency denied any allegations of mistreatment, and said ""ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE.”

Alrashid said for years her husband has performed classical Arabic music across Southern California. They first met when he was singing at a restaurant.

“He’s the kindest person,” Alrashid said, adding that he gave a sweater she brought him to a fellow detainee and to give others privacy, he built a makeshift barrier around the open toilet using trash bags.

“He’s brought a lot to the community, a lot of people love his music,"" she said.

More than a week after his arrest, fellow musicians, immigration advocates and activists joined Alrashid in a rally outside the facility.

A few of his colleagues performed classical Arabic music, drumming loud enough that they hoped the detainees inside could hear them. Los Jornaleros del Norte musicians, who often play Spanish-language music at rallies, also were there.

“In Latin American culture, the serenade — to bring music to people — is an act of love and kindness. But in this moment, bringing music to people who are in captivity is also an act of resistance,"" said Pablo Alvarado, co-executive director of the National Day Laborer Organizing Network.

Leading up to the rally, Alrashid was worried because she hadn't received her daily call from her husband and was told she couldn't visit him that day at the detention facility. She finally heard from him that evening.

Othmane told her over the phone he was now at an immigration detention facility in Arizona, and that his left leg was swollen.

“They should ultrasound your leg, don't take a risk,” she said.

Alrashid hopes to get her husband out on bail while his case is being processed. They had a procedural hearing on Thursday where the judge verified his immigration status, and have a bail bond hearing scheduled for Tuesday.

The Trump administration deported eight men — including Asian nationals — convicted of serious crimes to conflict-ridden South Sudan last week, marking an unprecedented expansion of the president’s immigration crackdown to a country the U.S. warns Americans not to visit.

Catch up: The deportees — hailing from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan, Vietnam and none from South Sudan — were convicted of crimes such as murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery. Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin announced the flight landed just before midnight Friday, with photos showing shackled men guarded by U.S. service members. The men had been held for weeks at Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti under dangerous conditions, The deportees — hailing from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, Sudan, Vietnam and none from South Sudan — were convicted of crimes such as murder, homicide, sexual assault, lascivious acts with a child and robbery. Assistant DHS Secretary Tricia McLaughlin announced the flight landed just before midnight Friday, with photos showing shackled men guarded by U.S. service members. The men had been held for weeks at Camp Lemonnier naval base in Djibouti under dangerous conditions, including malaria concerns and triple-digit temperatures.

In May, U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy ruled the administration breached court orders by sending the men to South Sudan without adequate due process. The deportations followed dramatic legal battles, with Murphy ultimately ruling Friday that Supreme Court orders were “binding” after the nation’s highest court cleared the way Thursday.

Under “care”: South Sudanese authorities South Sudanese authorities confirmed Tuesday that the eight men were in government custody after arriving Saturday at Juba International Airport. Foreign ministry spokesperson Apuk Ayuel said the men are “under the care of the relevant authorities who are screening them and ensuring their safety and well-being.” However, prominent civic leader Edmund Yakani criticized the move, saying, “South Sudan is not a dumping ground for criminals.” The men’s location has not been disclosed.

The big picture: The deportations represent a major victory for the administration’s efforts to convince third countries to accept non-citizen deportees regardless of human rights records. The strategy emerges when origin countries refuse deportees — Vietnam has historically limited acceptance of deportees despite a 2020 agreement, as illustrated by The deportations represent a major victory for the administration’s efforts to convince third countries to accept non-citizen deportees regardless of human rights records.

The Supreme Court’s ruling may enable similar future transfers to third countries despite ongoing due process challenges.

563,17,Israel defence minister plans to move Gaza's population to camp,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rp31lk7mzo,2025-07-08T10:33:24Z,BBC News,US,deportation,"Israeli defence minister plans to move Gaza's population to camp in Rafah

Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times during the war

If conditions allowed, he added, construction would begin during a 60-day ceasefire that Israel and Hamas are trying to negotiate.

He said the goal was to bring people inside after security screening to ensure they were not Hamas operatives, and that they would not be allowed to leave.

Israel Katz told journalists on Monday he wanted to establish a ""humanitarian city"" on the ruins of the city of Rafah to initially house about 600,000 Palestinians - and eventually the whole 2.1 million population.

Israel's defence minister says he has instructed its military to prepare a plan to move all Palestinians in Gaza into a camp in the south of the territory, Israeli media reports say.

One Israeli human rights lawyer condemned it as nothing less than an ""operational plan for a crime against humanity"".

""It is all about population transfer to the southern tip of the Gaza Strip in preparation for deportation outside the strip,"" Michael Sfard told the Guardian newspaper.

The UN has also previously warned that the deportation or forcible transfer of an occupied territory's civilian population is strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law and ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"".

There was no immediate comment from the Palestinian Authority or Hamas.

Later on Monday, during a meeting at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke about US President Donald Trump's proposal that the US take over post-war Gaza and permanently resettle its population elsewhere.

Netanyahu said: ""I think President Trump has a brilliant vision. It's called free choice. If people want to stay, they can stay, but if they want to leave, they should be able to leave...

""We're working with the United States very closely about finding countries that will seek to realise what they always say - that they wanted to give the Palestinians a better future.""

Trump said: ""We've had great co-operation from... surrounding countries, great cooperation from every single one of them. So, something good will happen.""

In March, Arab states backed a $53bn (£39bn) Egyptian alternative to Trump's plan for Gaza's reconstruction that would allow the Palestinians living there to stay in place.

They also stressed their ""categorical rejection of any form of displacement of the Palestinian people"", describing such an idea as ""a gross violation of international law, a crime against humanity and ethnic cleansing"".

The Palestinian Authority and Hamas also endorsed the Egyptian plan, but the US and Israel said it failed to address realities in Gaza.

Palestinians fear a repeat of the Nakba - the Arabic word for ""catastrophe"" - when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948.

Many of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three-quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the occupied West Bank, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN.

The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage.

More than 57,500 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.

Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times. More than 90% of homes are estimated to be damaged or destroyed; the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed; and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,

Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man legally residing in the US state of Maryland, whom the Trump administration mistakenly deported in a high-profile case in March, was severely beaten and subjected to psychological torture in prison there, his lawyers say.

The alleged abuse was detailed in court documents filed in Abrego Garcia’s civil lawsuit against the Trump administration on Wednesday, providing an account of his experiences following his deportation for the first time.

Abrego Garcia’s case has become a flashpoint in the US government’s controversial immigration crackdown since he was mistakenly deported to his native El Salvador in March, despite an earlier order by an immigration judge barring such a move.

According to his lawyers, Abrego Garcia fled El Salvador as a teenager to avoid gang violence, arriving in the United States around 2011. He has lived for more than a decade in Maryland, where he and his American wife are raising three children.

He was returned to the US last month and is currently locked in a legal battle with the US government, which has indicted him on charges of migrant smuggling and says it plans to deport him to a third country.

“Plaintiff Abrego Garcia reports that he was subjected to severe mistreatment upon arrival at CECOT, including but not limited to severe beatings, severe sleep deprivation, inadequate nutrition, and psychological torture,” his lawyers said in the filing, referring to the Salvadoran mega-prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Centre, or CECOT.

Severe beatings, threats

The filings, made in a civil suit in federal court against the US government brought by Abrego Garcia’s wife in Maryland, said her husband was hit and kicked so frequently upon his arrival at the prison that the next day his body was covered in lumps and bruises.

The filings also said he and other inmates were forced to kneel for nine hours straight throughout the night, or were hit by guards, in a cruel exercise of sleep deprivation.

It said prison staff repeatedly threatened to transfer Abrego Garcia to cells with gang members who would “tear” him apart, and claimed that he lost 31 pounds (14kg) in his first two weeks in jail as a result of the abuse.

‘Administrative error’

Abrego Garcia was detained by immigration officials and deported to El Salvador on March 15. Trump and US officials have accused him of belonging to the notorious MS-13 gang, which he denies.

The deportation took place despite an order from a US immigration judge in 2019, which barred Abrego Garcia from being sent back to El Salvador because he likely faced persecution there from gangs.

Abrego Garcia’s treatment gained worldwide attention, with critics of Trump’s aggressive immigration policy saying it demonstrated how officials were ignoring due process in their zeal to deport migrants. The Trump administration later described the deportation as an “administrative error”.

Last month, the US government complied with a directive from the court to return Abrego Garcia to the US, but only after having secured an indictment charging him with working with coconspirators as part of a smuggling ring to bring immigrants to the US illegally.

He is currently being detained in Nashville, Tennessee, while his criminal case is pending, having pleaded not guilty to illegally transporting undocumented immigrants.

The US government is arguing that the new civil suit is now moot, as Abrego Garcia has been returned from El Salvador. It has said it plans to deport him to a third country after he is released from custody.

Abrego Garcia a ‘criminal’ for DHS

In the wake of the latest court filings, the Trump administration doubled down on its attacks on Abrego Garcia as a dangerous illegal immigrant.

In a post on the social media platform X, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said the “media’s sympathetic narrative about this criminal illegal gang member has completely fallen apart”.

“Once again the media is falling all over themselves to defend Kilmar Abrego Garcia,” it said.

“This illegal alien is an MS-13 gang member, alleged human trafficker, and a domestic abuser,” DHS claimed, without providing any evidence.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

Jillian Segal made the recommendations in a report published on Thursday amid elevated concerns about anti-Semitism following a spate of violent incidents, including an alleged arson attack on a Melbourne synagogue last week.

“Countering antisemitism must not be the burden solely of the Jewish community; nor can we expect governments alone to fight antisemitism on Australians’ behalf,” Segal, who was appointed as Australia’s first special envoy on anti-Semitism last year, said in a foreword to the report.

“Community leaders, educators, businesses, media, creatives and citizens must unite. It is a responsibility shared by all Australians.”

Segal’s report said the envoy would work with the government and educational authorities to reverse a “dangerous trajectory” of normalised anti-Semitism at many universities, and withhold funding to institutions that engage in anti-Semitic “or otherwise discriminatory” speech and actions.

To guard against the “importation of hate”, non-citizens involved in anti-Semitism should face deportation, the report said, with the envoy to provide education on anti-Semitism to immigration officials to assist them with screening for visa applicants with hateful views.

Segal will also monitor media organisations “to encourage accurate, fair and responsible reporting”, advocate for “best practice regulation of online content,” and work with authorities to ensure artificial intelligence does not amplify anti-Semitic content, the report said.

Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, who leads the centre-left Labor Party, welcomed the report and said the government would “carefully consider” its recommendations.

He said some of the proposals could be implemented quickly and others “will require work over a period of time”.

“This is something that the government needs to work with civil society on at all levels … to make sure anti-Semitism is pushed to the margins,” Albanese told a news conference.

The Executive Council of Australian Jewry, a peak body representing Jewish communities across the country, praised the “well considered” plan and endorsed its recommendations.

“Its release could not be more timely given the recent appalling events in Melbourne,” ECAJ President Daniel Aghion KC said in a statement.

“The actions which the plan call for are now urgently needed.”

However, the Jewish Council of Australia, a progressive group that has been critical of Israel’s war in Gaza, warned that the plan risked “undermining Australia’s democratic freedoms, inflaming community divisions, and entrenching selective approaches to racism that serve political agendas”.

“This document reads more like a blueprint for silencing dissent rather than a strategy to build inclusion,” Jewish Council of Australia executive officer Max Kaiser said in a statement, criticising the report’s “vague” language and use of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance’s definition of anti-Semitism.

“Consistent with her past statements erroneously linking antisemitic attacks with Palestine solidarity protests, Segal seems fixated on driving a pro-Israel narrative and repressing legitimate criticism of Israel’s genocide in Gaza,” Kaiser added.

“Antisemitism is real and must be taken seriously.

For decades, tens of thousands of Afghans – who have fled war and poverty and sought a better future – have crossed into neighbouring Iran.

Tehran has largely been lenient towards members of this community. But in recent years, Iranians seem to have grown tired of hosting them – and sentiment towards foreign nationals has hardened.

The Iranian government has responded by expelling undocumented people. Those being forced out have no choice but to return to the country they escaped from.

While the Taliban government is welcoming returning Afghans, what kind of life awaits them, and what can the international community do to help?

568,8,Democrats publish leaked Justice Department messages on US deportation push,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/11/democrats-publish-leaked-justice-department-messages-on-deportation-push,2025-07-11T00:21:51Z,Al Jazeera English,US,deportation,"Senator Dick Durbin has said the messages appear to support claims that the Trump administration defied court orders.

Democrats in the United States Senate have released a string of text messages and email correspondences that they say raises questions about the executive branch’s commitment to complying with court orders.

On Thursday, Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois, the ranking member on the Senate Judiciary Committee, released what he described as “whistleblower” evidence about government lawyer Emil Bove.

In his role as acting deputy attorney general for the Department of Justice (DOJ), Bove directed his colleagues to ignore or mislead courts about President Donald Trump’s deportation efforts, according to Durbin.

“Text messages, email exchanges, and documents show that the Department of Justice misled a federal court and disregarded a court order,” Durbin wrote on social media.

“Mr Bove spearheaded this effort, which demanded attorneys violate their ethical duty of candor to the court.”

Bove – formerly a personal lawyer to President Trump during his criminal trials – was recently nominated to serve in a lifetime position as a judge on the US Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. But the Senate must first vote to confirm him to the role.

“Emil Bove belongs nowhere near the federal bench,” Durbin wrote. “This vote will be a litmus test for Senate Judiciary Republicans.”

Durbin indicated the emails and texts he released come from a Justice Department source: Most of the names in the correspondences have been redacted.

But they appear to corroborate allegations made in a complaint in June by Erez Reuveni, a Justice Department lawyer who worked under Bove until his dismissal in April.

In his complaint, Reuveni alleged that Bove told Justice Department lawyers that they “would need to consider telling the courts ‘f*** you'” if they interfered with President Trump’s deportation plans.

The expletive came up in the context of Trump’s controversial use of the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, a law that, until recently, had only been used in the context of war.

Trump, however, has argued that undocumented immigration constituted an “invasion” and has attempted to deport people under the law’s authority, without allowing them to appeal their removal.

According to Reuveni, Bove explained to the Justice Department that Trump planned to start the deportation flights immediately after invoking the Alien Enemies Act. He “stressed to all in attendance that the planes needed to take off no matter what”.

Reuveni understood that interaction as an attempt to circumvent the power of the courts.

In another instance, Reuveni said he was discouraged from asking questions about the return of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, an immigrant wrongfully deported to El Salvador despite a court protection order.

When Reuveni admitted before a Maryland court that he did not have “satisfactory” answers about Abrego Garcia’s return, he said Trump officials pressured him to make assertions against Abrego Garcia that “were not supported by law or the record”. He was fired shortly afterwards.

The documents gathered by Senate Democrats appear to offer a look inside those incidents.

In one series of emails, dated March 15, Reuveni responded to a notification that planes bearing deportees under the Alien Enemies Act were still in the air.

“The judge specifically ordered us not to remove anyone in the class, and to return anyone in the air,” he wrote back.

The emails reflected an injunction from District Judge James Boasberg barring deportations and ordering the planes to turn around.

Nevertheless, the planes landed in El Salvador and delivered their human cargo to a maximum security prison, where many remain to this day.

In another instance, a member of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) replied to an email thread by saying: “My take on these emails is that DOJ leadership and DOJ litigators don’t agree on the strategy. Please keep DHS out of it.”

Text messages also show Reuveni and an unnamed colleague discussing Bove’s request to tell the courts “f*** you”.

“Guess we are going to say f*** you to the court,” one text message reads.

In another, the colleague appears to react to Trump officials lying before the court. “Oh sh**,” they write. “That was just not true.”

In an interview published with The New York Times on Thursday, Reuveni underscored the grave dangers posed by an executive branch that he sees as refusing to comply with judicial authority.

“The Department of Justice is thumbing its nose at the courts, and putting Justice Department attorneys in an impossible position where they have to choose between loyalty to the agenda of the president and their duty to the court,” he told the Times.

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has responded with defiance, repeating its claim that Reuveni is simply a “disgruntled employee” lashing out at the employer who fired him.

“He’s a leaker asserting false claims seeking five minutes of fame, conveniently timed just before a confirmation hearing and a committee vote,” Attorney General Pam Bondi said.

“No one was ever asked to defy a court order. This is another instance of misinformation being spread to serve a narrative that does not align with the facts.”

Bove himself denied ever advising his colleagues to defy a court order. The Senate is set to decide on his confirmation to the circuit court in the coming weeks.

570,8,Florida governor announces deportation flights from Alligator Alcatraz,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/25/florida-governor-announces-deportation-flights-from-alligator-alcatraz,2025-07-25T19:08:34Z,Al Jazeera English,US,deportation,"Ron DeSantis, formerly Donald Trump’s Republican rival, said that the cadence for removal flights would be ‘increasing’.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has revealed that deportation flights have begun to depart from a remote detention facility known as Alligator Alcatraz, as the Republican leader seeks to put his state at the forefront of President Donald Trump’s immigration agenda.

Speaking from the south Florida site on Friday, DeSantis framed his efforts as a model for other states seeking to partner with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).

“I’m pleased to report that those flights out of Alligator Alcatraz by DHS have begun,” DeSantis told reporters.

“ The reality is this provides an ability to enhance the mission, to increase the number and frequency of deportations. And so what’s been done here has really been remarkable.”

A representative for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Garrett Ripa, also confirmed that “two or three removal flights” had already been conducted from the Alligator Alcatraz facility and that more were planned.

He indicated that those flights contained “ up to a hundred individuals who were illegally present in the state of Florida”.

Delegating resources

President Trump campaigned for re-election last November on the promise that he would undertake the “largest deportation operation in American history”.

But with more than 11 million undocumented people believed to be living in the United States, critics have pointed out that his ambitions may outstrip the amount of detention space and resources the government has available.

That has led the Trump administration to seek additional resources from state and local authorities, as well as assistance from foreign governments.

He has also deployed the military to assist in immigration enforcement operations, a task traditionally outside its scope.

Part of Trump’s toolkit has been deputising state and local leaders through Section 287(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act.

While the federal government is solely responsible for immigration enforcement, Section 287(g) creates a loophole that allows ICE to enter into written agreements with state and local authorities to perform specific immigration-related functions.

Speaking alongside DeSantis on Friday, Larry Keefe, the head of Florida’s newly established State Board of Immigration Enforcement, said his team has already taken advantage of such arrangements.

“Just within the last couple of days, the federal government has issued credentials to over 1,200 Florida sheriff’s deputies and over 650 FDLE [Florida Department of Law Enforcement] agents and other state and local law enforcement agencies,” Keefe said.

“We have more than doubled our capability and capacity to effect arrests.”

Florida at the forefront

Florida, however, has been testing the limits of what it is able to do independently in terms of cracking down on undocumented immigration within its state lines.

Earlier this year, for instance, the Florida’s Republican-led government passed a law, known as SB 4-C (PDF), that imposes stiff criminal penalties on adult undocumented immigrants who knowingly enter the state.

But federal courts placed an injunction to prevent the law from taking effect, on the basis that it preempts the federal government’s authority over all things immigration.

Still, President Trump has hailed the aggressive immigration efforts in Florida, his adopted home state, where he maintains a residence, Mar-a-Lago, as well as golf courses.

Earlier this month, he visited Alligator Alcatraz, applauding its fast-paced construction. “This is what you need,” Trump said at the time. “A lot of bodyguards and a lot of cops in the form of alligators.”

Critics have denounced the facility as an exercise in cruelty, with reports emerging of poor conditions inside Alligator Alcatraz. Some immigrants have said they faced floodwater, poor sanitation, clogged toilets and clouds of mosquitoes as they stayed in fenced-in units where the lights were never dimmed.

Environmental groups and Indigenous members of the local Seminole and Miccosukee tribes have also criticised the facility for its location in the middle of the Everglades wetlands, a sensitive ecosystem prone to seasonal flooding.

Utilising an old airfield

Built across eight days in June, Alligator Alcatraz sits atop the site of the former Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport in Ochopee, Florida.

That set-up has been a benefit for plans to also use the facility for deportation flights, DeSantis said on Friday. He described transferring immigrants from their detention cells to planes with relative ease.

“One of the reasons why this was a sensible spot is because you have this runway that’s right here,” DeSantis explained.

“You don’t have to drive them an hour to an airport. You go a couple thousand feet, and they can be on a plane and out of here.”

He added that the site already has runway lighting and 18,927 litres — or 5,000 gallons — of jet fuel on site. That, he hopes, will help pave the way for the number of deportation flights to increase in the coming weeks.

“ The cadence is increasing,” DeSantis said. “We’ve already had a number of flights in the last few days.”

Alligator Alcatraz — named for a forbidding island prison in the San Francisco Bay that closed in the 1960s — has the capacity to hold up to 3,000 people, according to Florida officials.

DeSantis has long positioned Florida as the “blueprint” for what Republican leadership in the US could look like, and in 2023, he launched a short-lived presidential campaign to challenge Trump for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination.

Increasing the pace

In his remarks on Friday, DeSantis briefly acknowledged the shortcomings in Trump’s mass-deportation plans, playing up the efficiency of the Alligator Alcatraz system.

“ICE has been understaffed — you know, is not scratching the surface of what would need to be done to get to where you have the largest mass deportation in history,” he said.

“So you’ve got to increase that tempo. You have a limited amount of time to do it. I think we’ve got to assume we’ve got these four years under the Trump administration to really get the job done.”

DeSantis also brushed aside concerns that the isolated facility cuts immigrants off from their legal representation and their right to be heard before a court.

He pointed out that he plans to have immigration judges on site. But he also questioned whether undocumented people should be allowed the same due process rights as US citizens and immigrants with legal status.

“To me, it’s like, if you are subjected to a traditional criminal process, there’s a whole a bunch of due process that goes into that,” DeSantis said.

By contrast, DeSantis argued that the immigration process “should be a pretty simple process. You either have a right to be here or you don’t.”",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

from the needs-more-cruelty,-said-the-administration dept

Trump advisor/subhuman ghoul Stephen Miller wants ICE to be arresting 3,000 people a day. So far, ICE has only managed to top out at 2,200 arrests in a single day, despite going full black ops in neighborhoods and businesses, driving unmarked cars, and leaving nothing exposed on officers’ bodies but their lifeless eyes.

Stephen Miller went after ICE itself back in May, calling it out for not being as cruelly efficient as it could be:

“Stephen Miller wants everybody arrested. ‘Why aren’t you at Home Depot? Why aren’t you at 7-Eleven?’” the official recited.

ICE did go to Home Depot, it must be noted. And because it did, Los Angeles is now filled with soldiers — more than 4,000 National Guard troops and another few hundred Marines.

The Trump administration couldn’t find enough criminals to arrest the first time it held power. With the quotas increasing exponentially during Trump’s second term, it’s no longer acceptable to just let ICE be ICE and raid whatever the hell it wants whenever the hell it wants to. It’s not enough to send federal officers into US courts to arrest migrants for daring to show up for their mandated check-ins. It’s not enough to pile as many people with brown skin into a bunch of buses for daring to exist in a nation that used to be considered a melting pot, not to mention a beacon of hope to oppressed people all over the world.

This irrational hatred can’t be satiated using the normal stuff, or even the “new normal” stuff, like daily raids of businesses by ICE. It probably can’t even be satiated by turning ICE into the largest federal law enforcement agency by adding another $60 billion to its budget, as Trump’s budget bill does.

Anything that might slow the removal of migrants from the US must be removed. The administration isn’t willing to tolerate any speed bumps that hinder its maximum cruelty efforts. Within the last two weeks, the administration has taken steps that will grease the already extremely slippery wheels of its mass deportation program.

To bump up numbers, the Trump administration is going to aggressively move forward with stripping US citizens of their citizenship.

Department leadership is directing its attorneys to prioritize denaturalization in cases involving naturalized citizens who commit certain crimes — and giving U.S. attorneys wider discretion on when to pursue this tactic, according to a June 11 memo published online. The move is aimed at U.S. citizens who were not born in the country; according to data from 2023, close to 25 million immigrants were naturalized citizens.

Yes, Trump is again playing all the old hits. He brought back the Alien Enemies Act — something made infamous for its abuse of Japanese migrants during World War II — to justify extrajudicial expulsions of migrants, routing them to foreign torture prisons and war-torn nations the US has no interest in making any less war-torn.

This moves the cruelty plan forward a half-decade or so, aligning the Trump administration with Cold War McCarthyism and the expeditious stripping of citizenship of anyone Joe McCarthy and his supporters felt weren’t American enough to remain Americans. This move goes further than earlier denaturalization efforts pursued by President Obama and Trump during his first term in office, rigging the game for the government by allowing it to use criminal charge removal justifications while bringing these cases in civil court.

The DOJ memo says that the federal government will pursue denaturalization cases via civil litigation — an especially concerning move, said Cassandra Robertson, a law professor at Case Western Reserve University. In civil proceedings, any individual subject to denaturalization is not entitled to an attorney, Robertson said; there is also a lower burden of proof for the government to reach, and it is far easier and faster to reach a conclusion in these cases. Robertson says that stripping Americans of citizenship through civil litigation violates due process and infringes on the rights guaranteed by the 14th Amendment.

Like any bully, the government isn’t interested in a fair fight. It will use criminal allegations during these hearings, while simultaneously denying those accused of full access to their rights.

Migrants not suspected of criminal acts aren’t in the clear, though. ICE may be working its way towards 3,000 arrests a day but that doesn’t mean the administration can’t punish people ICE hasn’t managed to arrest yet. Migrants in the country illegally will no longer be given a warning period before being fined for this civil infraction, allowing the government to run up the tab on several million people.

The Trump administration is looking to speed up its ability to fine those in the United States illegally — up to $1,000 per day — according to a rule set to be published Friday in the Federal Register that was obtained by ABC News. Currently, the government can alert those in the U.S. illegally 30 days before it starts issuing fines. The rule proposed by the departments of Justice and Homeland Security allows the government to immediately start fining those in the U.S. illegally.

People who’ve never been told their actions might subject them to daily fines will now be several thousand dollars in debt before they’re even aware this is an option the federal government has at its disposal. Trump started fining migrants during his first term, something that was halted when Biden took office. Trump’s return to the Oval Office brought the fines back. But it’s only now that the heads up issued to migrants is being replaced with federal silence and the steady tick of increasing fines.

The DHS says this is just good government business, pinning the blame on those who will not be notified their continued presence in the United States might be costing them up to $1,000 a day.

And, finally (at least in terms of this post), there’s this: the DHS unilaterally deciding Haiti is safe enough for displaced Haitians to return to, despite all evidence (including the administration’s own statements) to the contrary:

The Department of Homeland Security on Friday announced that it would terminate temporary protected status for Haiti, setting the groundwork for hundreds of thousands of Haitians to potentially be deported from the United States once the designation expires later this summer. The termination of temporary protected status — a designation that shields from deportation people who have traveled to the U.S. from countries that are deemed unsafe because of natural disasters, armed conflict or other extraordinary conditions — would put up to 500,000 Haitians at risk of deportation, as gang violence continues to roil the country.

DHS Bratz doll Kristi Noem says everything is going great in Haiti, claiming there’s no need to extend the temporary protected status. What’s left unsaid is why this is even happening, because there’s no way in hell the Trump administration will ever be honest about its own fear-mongering about Haitian immigrants or its willingness amplify racist conspiracy theories on national TV.

Noem and Trump say Haiti is safe. The State Department still disagrees, even with Marco Rubio currently serving as the top level of mismanagement.

Since March 2024, Haiti has been under a State of Emergency. Crimes involving firearms are common in Haiti. They include robbery, carjackings, sexual assault, and kidnappings for ransom. Kidnapping is widespread, and U.S. citizens have been victims and have been hurt or killed. Kidnappers may plan carefully or target victims at random, unplanned times. Kidnappers will even target and attack convoys. Kidnapping cases often involve ransom requests. Victims’ families have paid thousands of dollars to rescue their family members. Protests, demonstrations, and roadblocks are common and unpredictable. They often damage or destroy infrastructure and can become violent. Mob killings and assaults by the public have increased, including targeting those suspected of committing crimes. The airport in Port-au-Prince can be a focal point for armed activity. Armed robberies are common. Carjackers attack private vehicles stuck in traffic. They often target lone drivers, especially women. As a result, the U.S. embassy requires its staff to use official transportation to and from the airport.

This move says two things. First, Trump wants to expel Haitians because he probably believes they’re eating pets or otherwise are too dark-skinned to remain in the United States. Second, it says Haiti probably isn’t safe, but it’s safe enough for people this government no longer wants in this country. Separately, these implicit statements are horrible. Together, they’re just more Trump administration ugliness and bigotry from an administration that truly doesn’t care how awful it is, so long as it still has the support of the most awful people in the nation.

572,8,Canary Mission: How US uses a ‘hate group’ to target Palestine advocates,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/11/canary-mission-how-us-uses-a-hate-group-to-target-palestine-advocates,2025-07-11T16:03:36Z,Al Jazeera English,US,deportation,"The Trump administration confirms it is relying on the shadowy website to identify student protesters for deportation.

Washington, DC – The United States government has acknowledged its use of Canary Mission — a shadowy pro-Israel website — to identify pro-Palestine students for deportation, sparking anger and concern by rights advocates.

Activists have long suspected that the administration of US President Donald Trump is gathering information from the Canary Mission website to target students and professors.

But on Wednesday, that suspicion was confirmed when a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official testified in a court case challenging Trump’s efforts to deport pro-Palestinian student protesters.

Peter Hatch, an agent with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), said the department had assembled a specialised group — dubbed a “tiger team” — to work on removing pro-Palestine college students from the country.

He indicated to the court that some tips about students were communicated verbally, before explaining that the team had also combed through the nearly 5,000 profiles Canary Mission had compiled of Israel’s critics.

“You mean someone said, ‘Here is a list that the Canary Mission has put together?'” Judge William Young asked Hatch, according to court transcripts.

The official answered with a simple “yes”.

Heba Gowayed, a sociology professor at the City University of New York (CUNY), said the government’s reliance on an online blacklist that posts personal information to harm and intimidate activists is “absurd and fascist”.

“Canary Mission is a doxxing website that specifically targets people for language that they deem to be pro-Palestinian and therefore, they’ve decided, is anti-Semitic. Its sole purpose is to target and harass people,” Gowayed told Al Jazeera.

“How do you use a hate group … to identify people for whether or not they have the right to be present in the country?”

The crackdown

As demonstrations opposing the Israeli atrocities in Gaza swept college campuses last year, Israel’s advocates portrayed the protest movement as anti-Semitic and a threat to the safety of Jewish students.

While activists pushed back against the accusations, saying that the protests were aimed at combatting human rights abuses against Palestinians, conservative leaders called to crush the demonstrations and penalise the participants.

Shortly after returning to the White House in January, Trump himself signed a series of executive orders that laid the groundwork for targeting non-citizens who took part in the student protests for deportation.

“It shall be the policy of the United States to combat anti-Semitism vigorously,” one of the orders read.

It called on government officials to create systems to “monitor for and report activities by alien students and staff”.

In March, Columbia University graduate student Mahmoud Khalil — a permanent resident married to a US citizen — became the first prominent victim of Trump’s campaign.

Secretary of State Marco Rubio invoked a seldom-used provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act to order Khalil’s removal, on the basis that the Columbia student’s presence has “adverse” effects on American foreign policy.

After Khalil, many other students were detained by immigration authorities. Some left the country voluntarily to avoid imprisonment. Others, like Khalil, continue to fight their deportation.

Free speech advocates decried the campaign as a blatant violation of constitutionally protected freedoms.

But the Trump administration asserted that the issue is an immigration matter that falls under its mandate.

Before last year’s presidential elections, the Heritage Foundation, a prominent right-wing think tank, released a policy document titled Project Esther designed to dismantle the Palestine solidarity movement in the US.

Project Esther called for identifying students and professors critical of Israel who are in violation of their visas, and it cited Canary Mission extensively.

A ‘witch hunt’ against students

For years, Palestinian rights advocates have condemned Canary Mission for publishing identifying information about activists — their names, photos and employment histories — while keeping its own staff anonymous.

In its ongoing deportation campaign against student activists, the Trump administration has said that it is targeting students who engaged in violent conduct, promoted anti-Semitism and had ties to “terrorist” groups.

But none of the prominent students detained by ICE have been charged with a crime, and some only engaged in mild criticism of Israel.

For example, the only accusation against Rumeysa Ozturk, a Turkish scholar at Tufts University, is that she co-authored an op-ed asking her school to honour a student resolution calling for divestment from Israeli companies.

That column, published in the university’s student newspaper, landed Ozturk on the Canary Mission’s blacklist, which appears to have led to the Trump administration’s push to deport her.

Andrew Ross, a New York University professor of social and cultural analysis, said the US administration’s use of Canary Mission’s data shows that the government’s push is “sloppy” and biased.

He added that while Canary Mission appears well funded, its content is curated to paint its targets in a certain light.

“They’re looking for material and content that they can manipulate and spin and present as if the person being profiled is anti-Semitic basically,” said Ross, who has his own Canary Mission profile for criticising Israel.

The professor accused the Trump administration of “fundamental dishonesty”, describing the deportation campaign as a “witch hunt”.

How does Canary Mission work?

While Canary Mission does not appear to fabricate data, it portrays criticism of Israel as bigoted and dangerous.

Some profiles denounce individuals for actions as innocuous as sharing materials from Amnesty International condemning Israeli abuses.

The profiles seem to be optimised for internet searches. So, even if the accusations lack merit, targeted individuals often report that their Canary Mission profiles sit at the top of online searches for their names.

Advocates say the tactic can have a detrimental impact on careers, mental health and safety.

“It has caused people to lose jobs. It has caused people all kinds of adverse effects,” Gowayed said.

For his part, Ross said he has received hate mail because of Canary Mission. He worries the website can be especially harmful for marginalised groups.

“Those, as we are seeing, who don’t have full citizenship status are particularly vulnerable at this point in time. But it could be anyone,” he said.

The website was founded in 2015, and it has been expanding since. Nevertheless, barring a few media leaks over the years, the operators and funders of Canary Mission remain anonymous.

In 2018, Haaretz reported that Israeli authorities have relied on the website to detain people and bar them from entering the country.

That same year, the outlet The Forward found that Canary Mission is linked to an Israel-based non-profit called Megamot Shalom. Since then, media reports have revealed the names of a few wealthy American donors who have made contributions to the website through a network of Jewish charities.

‘Silencing dissent’

On Thursday, Palestine Legal, an advocacy group, accused the Trump administration of racism for relying on the website.

“Under Trump, ICE has now publicly admitted they are abducting pro-Palestinian student activists based on an anonymously-run blacklist site,” Palestine Legal said in a social media post.

“Both the mass deportation machine, and these horrific blacklists, clearly run on racism.”

J Street, a group that describes itself as pro-Israel and pro-peace, also decried the government’s use of the website.

“Canary Mission is feeding the Trump Administration’s agenda, weaponizing antisemitism to surveil and attempt to deport student activists,” it said. “This isn’t about protecting Jews — it’s about silencing dissent.”

The State Department did not respond to Al Jazeera’s query on the government’s use of Canary Mission. Instead, a department spokesperson referred to a statement by Secretary of State Rubio from May.

“The bottom line is, if you’re coming here to stir up trouble on our campuses, we will deny you a visa. And if you have a visa, and we find you, we will revoke it,” it said.

DHS did not respond to Al Jazeera’s request for comment.

But the Trump administration may also be using more extreme sources than Canary Mission to deport students.

At Wednesday’s court hearing, Hatch was asked about other sources the government is using. He replied that there was one other website he could not recall.

The court asked Hatch if it might be Betar, a far-right, Islamophobic group with links to the violent Kahanist movement in Israel.

According to transcripts, Hatch replied, “That sounds right.”

Gowayed, the City University of New York professor, called the government’s approach an “egregious overstep and distortion of any kind of notion of justice or legality”.

But she added: “What is more troubling to me is they don’t know which hate group they used.”",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,
573,8,How Donald Trump’s spending bill could kick US deportations into overdrive,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/4/how-donald-trumps-spending-bill-could-kick-us-deportations-into-overdrive,2025-07-04T20:46:19Z,Al Jazeera English,US,deportation,"Advocates say the bill would deliver an infusion of cash to deportation efforts, as communities struggle with arrests.

Immigrant advocates have warned that the tax and spending bill championed by United States President Donald Trump will send the administration’s controversial deportation campaign into overdrive.

The bill — called the “One Big Beautiful Bill” among its supporters — is slated to be signed into law on Friday, ushering in an influx of funds for Trump’s immigration crackdown.

That comes as experts say the Trump administration has already taken drastic measures to increase its immigration arrests and expulsions. Those arrests have cut deep into communities across the country, prompting protests and other forms of public outcry.

In a statement following the passage of the bill, Vanessa Cardenas, the executive director of the immigration reform group America’s Voice, took aim at White House adviser Stephen Miller.

He is widely seen as the architect of Trump’s hardline immigration policies across his first and second administrations.

“His dreams are America’s nightmare,” Cardenas said. “His mass deportation crusade already is imperiling our industries, spreading fear in American communities, and ripping American families apart and would become all the worse if the big ugly bill becomes law.”

Here’s how the bill could be transformative.

Historic deportation funding

All told, the bill passed by the House and Senate earmarks about $170bn for immigration and border enforcement funding.

That, according to the American Immigration Council (AIC), represents the “largest investment in detention and deportation in US history”.

Of that money, $45bn will go to new immigration detention centres for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), a branch of the Department of Homeland Security that oversees immigration arrests and the detention of individuals already in the country.

That’s a whopping 265-percent increase from ICE’s fiscal year 2024 detention budget, at a time when advocates have continued to raise concerns about the conditions and oversight of immigration detention centres.

Those funds are projected to expand the capacity of the country’s detention centres from about 56,000 beds to more than 100,000, according to an analysis from the Brennan Center for Justice, a nonpartisan policy institute.

Much of that money is likely to go to private companies, the Brennan Center added. Private firms already oversee about 90 percent of detention centre capacity and will “reap major financial benefits” from the new bill, the analysis said.

“The plan to put hundreds of thousands more people in ICE detention facilities comes at a time when DHS is blocking oversight of those facilities,” Brennan Center analyst Lauren-Brook Eisen wrote.

“And there have been growing reports of unsanitary, harsh, and unsafe conditions. At least 10 people have died in immigration detention so far this year, a rate nearly three times the number of deaths over the past four years.”

The bill’s language has also sparked concerns that it could override legal restraints over how long immigration authorities can detain children, as established in the 1997 Flores settlement.

The American Civil Liberties Union has said the legislation is “opening the door to prolonged detention of children and families”.

Growing immigration ‘dragnet’

The legislation also allocates nearly $29.9bn for ICE’s deportation and enforcement operations, a threefold increase compared to the fiscal year 2024 budget, according to the American Immigration Council.

Immigrant advocates say the agency has already begun to employ increasingly severe tactics to surge its arrest numbers to fulfil Trump’s campaign promise of mass deportation.

In May, immigration officials reportedly set a daily arrest target of 3,000 per day, three times the previously reported goal.

But immigration agents averaged only about 778 arrests per day during Trump’s first months in office, according to government data from January 26 to May 3.

Speaking during a news conference in June, Cardenas warned that the pressure campaign was already creating a “situation on the ground where ICE is literally just trying to go after anybody that they can catch”.

That included raids on workplaces and locations like hardware store parking lots, where immigrants are known to gather for informal construction gigs. Undocumented individuals brought to the US as children, known as “Dreamers”, have also been caught up in the arrest sweeps.

Cardenas described the strategy as a “dragnet” that touched “long-established, deeply rooted Dreamers and other folks that have been in the United States for a long time”.

To increase their arrest numbers, immigration officials have instructed ICE agents to “get creative”, according to a June report from The Guardian newspaper. They encouraged agents to remain vigilant for undocumented individuals whom they may encounter by chance, referred to as “collaterals” in internal emails.

The Trump administration has also sought to expand its cooperation with local law enforcement. The Tennessee Highway Patrol and ICE, for example, collaborated on a series of traffic stops in May that local immigrant advocates decried as blatant racial profiling.

The new legislation includes $3.5bn to reimburse states for immigration enforcement and cooperation.

“We are becoming a police state,” said Gaby Pacheco, the president of TheDream.US, which helps undocumented students pursue higher education and careers.

During a June news conference, Pacheco warned of increased cooperation between local law enforcement and immigration officials.

“It’s difficult to see that those individuals in our community that we have always cherished, like police officers and campus safety, are now acting to the detriment of our communities and going after immigrants,” she said.

Rounding out the immigration funding in the bill is $46.6bn for border wall construction and $4.1bn to hire and train more border patrol agents.

Will the funding ‘make America safe’?

Trump has, for years, pushed the premise that mass deportations are the only way to repair a country beset by dangerous foreign criminals.

Studies, however, show that undocumented people commit crimes at lower rates than US-born citizens.

After Trump’s bill was passed by the House on Thursday, Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem wrote on social media that the legislation is “a win for law and order and the safety and security of the American people”.

She added it will “further deliver on President Trump’s mandate to arrest and deport criminal illegal aliens and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN”.

But new data has continued to cast doubt on the administration’s claims.

On Thursday, The Washington Post published an analysis that found that, while the number of immigration arrests has risen in recent months, the proportion of those arrested with criminal convictions has fallen.

In January, about 46 percent of immigration detainees had been convicted of a crime, according to the report, which relied on statistics obtained by the Deportation Data Project and the UCLA Center for Immigration Law and Policy.

By June, that proportion had dropped to 30 percent.

The report noted that the details of the charges, and their severity, were not available.

Meanwhile, 61 percent of the 93,818 people deported from the country since Trump took office had no criminal convictions, according to the Post. Entering the US without documentation is a civil, not criminal, offence.

Another data analysis, from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), offered similar findings.

Out of the 56,397 people held in immigration detention as of June 15, about 71 percent did not have criminal convictions, though 25 percent did have pending charges.

Hector Sanchez Barba, president of Mi Familia Vota, a Hispanic voters advocacy group, was among those decrying Trump’s bill as it passed in the House on Thursday.

In a statement, he pointed to the estimated $3.3 trillion the bill is expected to add to the national debt, as well as the cuts to the programmes for low-income individuals, like Medicaid, used to offset the spending.

“Our children and grandchildren will have to pay for its massive debt,” he said, “while obscene amounts of money will go to ICE policies that punish families and the essential workers our economy needs for their hard work and tax dollars.”",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

Washington, DC – Mahmoud Khalil, the Columbia University protest leader targeted for deportation by President Donald Trump, has met with lawmakers in Washington, DC.

The visit on Tuesday comes just more than a month after the 30-year-old, a legal permanent resident of the United States, was released from immigration custody in Louisiana.

“I’m here in Washington, DC, today to meet with lawmakers, with members of Congress, to demand the end of the US-funded genocide in Gaza, and also to demand accountability from Columbia University, from the Trump administration for their retaliation against my speech,” said Khalil in a video interview with the news agency Reuters.

“To be honest, I feel that this is my duty to continue advocating for Palestinians. This is what the Trump administration tried to do. They tried to silence me. But I’m here to say that we will continue to resist. We are not backing down.”

Khalil continues to face deportation under the Trump administration, which has relied on an obscure provision of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 in its attempts to expel international students involved in pro-Palestinian advocacy.

Under the law, the secretary of state can expel a foreign national if their presence in the country is deemed to have “potentially serious adverse foreign policy consequences for the United States”, although the standard for making that determination remains unclear.

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and immigration officials have repeatedly portrayed Khalil’s advocacy as anti-Jewish and supportive of Hamas, but they have failed to provide evidence backing those claims.

Lawyers for Khalil and three other students targeted for deportation by the Trump administration — Mohsen Mahdawi, Rumeysa Ozturk and Badar Khan Suri — have argued that their arrests trample on the constitutionally protected freedom of speech.

Several district judges have sided with that position in ordering the students’ release from custody as their cases proceed in immigration court.

Earlier this month, Khalil, who missed the birth of his son while detained, filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration alleging malicious prosecution, as well as false arrest and imprisonment. He is seeking $20m in damages or an apology from the government.

US Senator Bernie Sanders was among the lawmakers who met with Khalil on Tuesday.

“We must not allow Trump to destroy the First Amendment & freedom to dissent,” Sanders said in a post on the social media platform X, accompanied by a photo with Khalil.

Khalil also met with Congress members Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, Ayanna Pressley, Jim McGovern, Troy Carter and Summer Lee.

“Mahmoud Khalil is a kind, gentle soul who cares deeply about others’ humanity, and his abduction, detention, and ongoing persecution by the Trump Admin is egregious,” Pressley wrote in a post on X.

“Our meeting today was fortifying and productive.”

In its own social media message on Tuesday, the Department of Homeland Security once again called Khalil a “terrorist sympathiser”, accusing him of anti-Jewish “hateful behavior and rhetoric”.

However, ahead of his release in June, federal Judge Michael Farbiarz said he had given the administration lawyers ample time to support the public statements made against Khalil. He said they failed to do so.

“The petitioner’s career and reputation are being damaged and his speech is being chilled,” Farbiarz wrote at the time. “This adds up to irreparable harm.”",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

Supreme Court says administration can remove 8 migrants being held in Djibouti

The Supreme Court in a 7-2 decision on Thursday ruled that the Trump administration is not obligated to keep eight noncitizens in temporary confinement at a U.S. military facility in Djibouti while a legal battle over their status plays out, clearing the way for their removal to South Sudan -- a country with which the men have no ties.

The immigrants in question, who were convicted of violent crimes, were given notices of removal from the U.S. to the East African country of South Sudan -- but after U.S. District Judge Brian Murphy blocked the administration's attempt to deport the group without giving them a sufficient chance to contest their removal, the group has been in legal limbo.

In an unexplained decision last week, the Supreme Court lifted Judge Murphy's injunction, allowing the deportation of migrants to third countries without additional due process requirements that Murphy had imposed .

Subsequently, Judge Murphy said he believed specifically that the eight men in Djibouti -- who sued to challenge their removal -- remained protected from being sent to South Sudan under an earlier order he had issued.

The Trump administration attacked Murphy as exhibiting ""defiance"" of the Supreme Court and asked for clarification. The Thursday ruling from the high court granted the administration's wish.

The decision is another win for the Trump administration and its unprecedented effort to deport immigrants to countries with which they have no ties and where they may face mistreatment.

In an unsigned opinion, the court explained that since it lifted judge-imposed due process requirements for third-country removals last month, the government can no longer be held to account for allegedly violating the requirements.

""I do not see how a district court can compel compliance with an order that this Court has stayed,"" wrote liberal Justice Elena Kagan in a short concurrence with the conservative justices.

Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan dissented.

576,46,Venezuela says it will investigate El Salvador officials over alleged abuse of Cecot detainees deported from US,https://www.cnn.com/2025/07/21/americas/venezuela-investigation-el-salvador-alleged-abuse-cecot-intl-latam,2025-07-21T22:53:48Z,CNN,US,deportation,"CNN —

Venezuela says it is opening a formal investigation into several Salvadoran officials, including President Nayib Bukele, over the alleged abuse of Venezuelan migrants deported from the US.

Some 252 Venezuelans, who had been imprisoned at the notorious Cecot prison in March following their deportation, were released and returned to their home country on Friday in exchange for 10 US nationals and dozens of Venezuelan political prisoners, US officials said.

Venezuela has previously accused El Salvador of kidnapping the detainees after it agreed with the US to take them into custody. El Salvador claimed the detainees had ties to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, though immigration attorneys, advocates and family members have pushed back on that, claiming in many cases that the detainees had no criminal record.

Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab held a press conference Monday to address the alleged mistreatment, showing edited footage of some of the detainees talking about their experience at the prison. Saab said officials have gathered 123 complaints of abuse, including reports of sexual assault, torture and beatings by Salvadoran prison guards.

In one of the videos, a man says he was sexually abused.

In another, several detainees who claim to have been beaten and shot at with pellets and pepper spray show what appear to be bruises and scars all over their bodies.

CNN cannot independently verify the extent of the injuries, when they were sustained, or whether the men were speaking under duress. It has reached out to the Salvadoran presidency for comment.

In the past, the Bukele administration has said it respects the human rights of those in custody “without distinction of nationality” and that its prison system meets safety and order standards.

Venezuela has itself faced accusations of abuse in its prisons, but its government insists it respects the rights of inmates.

The released migrants have not yet been reunited with their families in Venezuela. Authorities say they are undergoing health, immigration, and criminal background checks, among other procedures – a routine process for deportees returning to the country.

Two relatives of the ex-detainees told CNN they were still waiting for Venezuelan officials to hand them over to their families. One relative said her nephew could be handed over today. CNN has not had access to any of the released Venezuelans.

The migrants arrived at Simón Bolívar International Airport close to Caracas on two flights that departed from El Salvador, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro said.

Families of the ex-detainees told CNN on Friday that they were excited about their return.

Mariyin Araujo, the wife of Jerce Reyes, said she was “overjoyed.”

“My two daughters are super happy; they are really anxious and cannot wait to see their father,” she said on Friday.

Blanca Martínez, the partner of another former Venezuelan detainee, Miguel Ángel Rojas, told CNN she was thrilled that she would hear from him for the first time in four months.

“To think that we will be able to hear him … it excites me,” she said. “I’m happy, happy for him, his son, his mom, his dad, his whole family.”",NewsAPI,-6.23,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnn-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,42.09,"cnn, CNN, Cable News Network, cnn.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/cnn/,https://ground.news/interest/cnn,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/cnn-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MOSTLY FACTUAL (3.7),USA,,TV Station/Website,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Turner Broadcasting System,1980,-1.3,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,cnn.com,,cnn,57,USA,Y,F,CNN,
578,8,Iran tells millions of Afghans to leave or face arrest on day of deadline,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/6/iran-tells-millions-of-afghans-to-leave-or-face-arrest-on-day-of-deadline,2025-07-06T10:31:31Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"Afghans given Sunday deadline amid concerns over security after conflict with Israel, but humanitarian groups warn that mass deportations could further destabilise Afghanistan.

Millions of Afghan migrants and refugees in Iran have been asked to leave or face arrest as a deadline set by the government comes to an end.

Sunday’s target date neared amid public concerns over security in the aftermath of the 12-day conflict with Israel, which the United States joined with air strikes on Iran’s uranium-enrichment facilities.

But humanitarian organisations warned that mass deportations could further destabilise Afghanistan, one of the world’s most impoverished nations. Iran is home to an estimated 4 million Afghan migrants and refugees, and many have lived there for decades.

In 2023, Tehran launched a campaign to expel foreigners it said were living in the country “illegally”. In March, the Iranian government ordered that Afghans without the right to remain should leave voluntarily by Sunday or face expulsion.

Since then, more than 700,000 Afghans have left, and hundreds of thousands of others face expulsion. More than 230,000 departed in June alone, the United Nations International Organization for Migration said.

The government has denied targeting Afghans, who have fled their homeland to escape war, poverty and Taliban rule.

Batoul Akbari, a restaurant owner, told Al Jazeera that Afghans living in Tehran were hurt by “anti-Afghan sentiment”, adding that it was heartbreaking to see “people sent away from the only home they have ever known”.

“Being born in Iran gives us the feeling of having two homelands,” Akbari said. “Our parents are from Afghanistan, but this is what we’ve always known as home.”

Mohammad Nasim Mazaheri, a student whose family had to leave Iran, agreed: “The deportations have torn families apart.”

The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that Iran deported more than 30,000 Afghans on average each day during the war with Israel, up from about 2,000 earlier.

“We have always striven to be good hosts, but national security is a priority, and naturally, illegal nationals must return,” Iranian government spokesperson Fatemeh Mohajerani said on Tuesday.

Late last month, the UNHCR said, of the 1.2 million returning Afghans, more than half had come from Iran after its government set its deadline on March 20.

“They are coming in buses, and sometimes, five buses arrive at one time with families and others, and the people are let out of the bus, and they are simply bewildered, disoriented and tired and hungry as well,” Arafat Jamal, the UNHCR representative in Afghanistan said as he described the scene at a border crossing.

“This has been exacerbated by the war, but I must say it has been part of an underlying trend that we have seen of returns from Iran, some of which are voluntary, but a large portion were also deportations.”

Al Jazeera’s Resul Serdar, reporting from Tehran, said Afghans have increasingly been blamed for economic hardships, shortages and social issues in Iran.

“These accusations have been fuelled by political rhetoric and social media campaigns following 12 days of conflict between Iran and Israel and claims that Israel has recruited Afghans as spies,” he said.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

The UK is reportedly considering reviving its ""golden visa"" plan to attract wealthy foreign investors as it faces the prospect of a record-breaking outflow of millionaires.

The proposed investor visa, which Bloomberg reported is under discussion by senior government ministers, would target high-net-worth individuals (HNWI) willing to invest in strategically important sectors such as artificial intelligence, clean energy, and biotech.

The UK Home Office declined to comment on any potential plans.

The move comes amid growing concerns that the UK's crackdown on tax perks for the wealthy — including the abolition of the non-dom regime in April — could drive a mass departure of wealthy residents and their capital.

An April analysis by the Centre for Economics and Business Research found that if half of former non-domiciled taxpayers left the country, the Treasury could face net losses of £2.4 billion ($3.26 billion) in the first year alone.

Until its repeal, the ""non-dom"" regime had allowed wealthy foreign nationals living in the UK to avoid paying UK tax on income earned abroad, making Britain especially attractive to global elites with international assets.

However, according to Henley & Partners' Private Wealth Migration Report 2025, Britain is projected to lose 16,500 millionaires this year alone, more than any other country on record, including China, in part due to tax changes.

It's a dramatic reversal for a nation once seen as a hub for global wealth.

'Much of the damage has already been done'

Analysts blamed rising taxes, political instability, and the end of the non-dom status for the departure of the ultrawealthy.

""There's no doubt a refreshed golden visa scheme could help slow the exodus and potentially lure some HNWIs back — but let's be clear: much of the damage has already been done,"" Nigel Green, CEO of global financial advisory giant deVere Group, told Business Insider.

""The UK's competitiveness in the global race for wealth has taken a significant hit in recent times, and trust doesn't return overnight,"" he said.

""Still, for those with long-standing business, personal, or cultural ties to Britain, it could be enough to start a conversation again. It's not a silver bullet, but it may be worth a shot.""

Matthew Lesh, UK country manager at consultancy Freshwater Strategy, blamed what he called ""the toxic mix of historically high taxes and the abolition of the non-dom regime.""

He said it has ""resulted in thousands of the world's wealthiest individuals fleeing"" the UK, adding: ""It's often forgotten that not only do the wealthiest have the widest shoulders, but also the longest legs.""

According to the UK's National Audit Office, wealthy individuals paid £119 billion ($161 billion) in personal taxes in 2023-24, accounting for 25% of all UK personal tax receipts. The top 29,000 earners alone were responsible for £34 billion in income tax.

""A new 'golden visa' could be an attractive prospect for some of the world's wealthiest,"" Lesh continued, ""but if they arrive to find themselves paying exorbitant taxes for poor public services and threatened by a new 'wealth tax,' they are unlikely to stick around for long.""

A tarnished history

The UK's original Tier 1 investor visa, introduced in 2008, granted residency to foreigners who invested at least £1 million ($1.35 million). That threshold was raised to £2 million in 2014.

The route was scrapped in February 2022 amid mounting concerns over illicit finance and national security, especially after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

A 2023 government review found that a minority of golden visa holders before 2015 were flagged as high risk, with some holders possibly linked to corruption or organized crime.

That history has left a bitter legacy.

In a letter to Chancellor Rachel Reeves this month, a coalition of anti-corruption groups warned that a new investor visa would ""expose the UK to acute national security risks by facilitating foreign influence and the flow of illicit finance.""

'Change the narrative'

Supporters argue that a new plan could be more tightly designed, and is urgently needed.

James Quarmby, head of private wealth at law firm Stephenson Harwood, told BI the government ""can't afford to ignore the reality.""

""When you've got a lot of people leaving, you've got two choices — either stop them by changing the rules that are driving them out, or attract new people in.""

""An investment visa could change the narrative in the UK,"" he said. ""Right now, the perception among wealth holders and their advisors is that the UK has become a hostile place for capital.""

Quarmby said the visa should be bold and transparent, with meaningful incentives: ""£2 million is too low. I'd recommend a £4 to £5 million minimum investment. But that must come with tax incentives.""

""The government also needs to guarantee policy stability,"" he added. ""People aren't going to relocate their lives and businesses to the UK only to have the rules change again in two years.""

Green echoed that view: ""The number one deterrent is uncertainty. Tax policy has become unpredictable, and for HNWIs, that's a dealbreaker. It's not just about rates — it's about tone, messaging, and direction of travel.""

A political balancing act

The proposal puts the UK government in a tricky position. While the government faces intense fiscal pressure and limited room for big tax hikes, it must also appease a parliamentary base wary of any measures seen as overtly pro-wealth.

Quarmby predicts Labour will ""quietly"" pursue an investor visa under a different label.

""I doubt they'll call it a golden visa — it'll be something more palatable, like a 'Global Talent Visa' with an investment component. That way, it sounds more blue-collar.""

Still, he sees the odds of action as high.

""There's at least a 60-40 chance this happens. The Treasury is running out of options. If you're out of blood to squeeze from the current tax base, you need new blood.""

However, Green cautioned: ""The UK used to be a magnet for global wealth — now it's often seen as a cautionary tale. Rebuilding trust will require sustained effort and meaningful reforms, not just a visa tweak.""",NewsAPI,-4.05,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,40.61,"business insider, Business Insider, Insider, businessinsider.com, insider.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/,https://ground.news/interest/business-insider,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/insider-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.3),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Axel Springer SE,2007,-1.46,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,businessinsider.com,,business insider,20,USA,,,,
580,104,Trump Announces He's Working on Mass Amnesty Plan for Illegal Aliens After Passing 'Big Beautiful Bill',https://www.informationliberation.com/?id=64976,2025-07-10T15:46:36Z,Informationliberation.com,US,mass migration,"

In his first speech after the House passed his ""Big Beautiful Bill,"" President Trump on Thursday announced he's working on a mass amnesty for potentially millions of illegal aliens working in farm, hotel and leisure industries which ""radical right people"" won't be happy about.



""You probably saw I got myself into a little trouble because I said, I don't want to take people away from the farmers and we're going to do something I think that's going to be good,"" Trump told a crowd in Des Moines, Iowa.



Referring to illegal aliens, Trump said: ""If a farmer is willing to vouch for these people in some way, Kristi [Noem], I think we're gonna have to just say that's going to be good, right? You know, we're gonna be- we're gonna be good with it because we don't want to do it where we take all of the workers off the farms.""



""We're working on legislation right now,"" he said.



""I think that that's going to make a lot of people happy,"" Trump said. ""Now, serious radical right people, who I also happen to like a lot, they may not be quite as happy but they'll understand, won't they?""

Stephen Miller and other MAGA shills were all pushing this ""Big Beautiful Bill"" by telling their followers it would lay the groundwork for mass deportations but not even 24 hours later Trump is already pushing for a mass amnesty.

581,148,Nature's most extreme fat loss is fueled by 28.5 million shrimp snacks,https://newatlas.com/biology/whales-migration-fat/,2025-07-29T05:50:43Z,New Atlas,US,mass migration,"Humpback whales may look like gentle giants, but each year they undertake nature's most extreme crash diet, shedding around 36% of their mass in less than two months – somehow avoiding the tissue breakdown that comes with starvation in other species. Now, new insights into their epic migration has uncovered just how massive their fat loss is.

Researchers from Australia's Griffith University used drones to follow 103 adult humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) across the southern hemisphere, from their cold-water feeding grounds on the Western Antarctic Peninsula to the warmer climes of their breeding site off the coast of Colombia.

Of particular interest was seeing how this 5,000-mile (8,000-km) one-way journey transformed their huge bodies, and how they managed to burn through blubber but remained healthy enough by the time they reached the tropics for the females to birth calves.

The researchers found that the mammals burn 24,250 lb (11,000 kg) of blubber – the weight of two adult African elephants – on their marathon swim, downsizing their bulk by more than a third. All without stopping for even a snack on the way. To power this, they need the equivalent of around 125,700 lb (57,000 kg) of krill, enough to fill a cement mixer full of the tiny crustaceans, a load that outweighs an Airbus A320 jet at takeoff. That's an estimated 28.5 million individual krill for each migrating whale.

It's the metabolic equivalent of a 200-lb (90-kg) person losing more than 70 lb (30 kg) in less than two months – without any negative health impacts.

“Southern hemisphere humpback whales depend on Antarctic krill for their annual energy requirements, fueling their long migrations between feeding and breeding grounds,” said lead researcher Alexandre Bernier-Graveline. “We found the whales were at their fattest in early autumn (fall) – March-May – and slimmest by late spring – August-December – showing a dramatic seasonal change in body condition.

“Our study quantifies the whales’ extreme ‘feast and fast’ lifestyle, and the critical role of Antarctic krill in their survival and migratory life-history strategy,"" he added.

This extreme fat loss provides new insights into the animal's robust physiology and metabolism – and how much fuel is needed to complete this long-haul trip. The energy they burn on their six-to-eight-week journey, Bernier-Graveline estimates, is roughly all the calories that an average human consumes in 62 years.

Unlike humans, whale blubber is a more readily available fuel to burn than what we store in our fat cells. As such, their extreme fasting regimen doesn't impact their overall health or damage organ systems. However, one strain on their finely tuned physiology is very much linked to us: Ice loss in Antarctica.

Both rapid climate changes in the region, as well as a pattern of overfishing, have seen krill numbers trend downward. This also affects other species including chinstrap (Pygoscelis antarcticus) and gentoo (P. papua) penguins, but is likely to be felt the most in large mammals like humpbacks that require millions of these shrimp-like individuals to bulk up each year.

The new research helps scientists better understand the requirements of humpbacks and how the availability of keystone species krill (Euphausia superba) could directly impact whale numbers. It also shows how technological advances – in this case, drone-based photogrammetry – can provide crucial information about the life cycles and behaviors of elusive marine mammal species.

""By linking migration and reproductive energy costs to krill biomass, our findings provide critical ecological context for understanding how environmental changes such as krill population fluctuations could impact whale populations,"" the researchers noted.

The research was published in the journal Marine Mammal Science.

582,8,Europe’s deadly border theatre is back,https://www.aljazeera.com/opinions/2025/7/30/europes-deadly-border-theatre-is-back,2025-07-30T08:34:41Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"On July 10, Thanos Plevris, the Greek minister for migration, announced new legislation that would effectively deny asylum to those who reach the Greek shores following a treacherous journey through the Mediterranean from Africa. “Greece will not tolerate the uncontrolled entry of thousands of irregular migrants from North Africa,” Plevris said during an interview. Reactions against Greece’s new legislation were immediate: Human rights organisations described it as illegal and called for its withdrawal. The Plenary of Greek Bar Associations emphasised that denying the right to asylum is a violation of international and EU legislation.

On the same day, but on the other side of the continent, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer outlined a “ground-breaking deal” with France, which he said would target small boats and smuggling gangs and send “a clear message that these life-threatening journeys are pointless”. The UK-France deal has been criticised by all sides of the political spectrum. Organisations such as Doctors Without Borders called it “reckless”, “ill-fated” and “dangerous”, while the Migrants’ Rights Network emphasised that the new agreement will not prevent people from trying to cross to the UK.

Greece and the UK’s new plans to curb migration are set to fail, and the reason is simple: migration deterrence does not work.

A decade ago, in the summer of 2015, the European Union faced a crisis it did not expect and for which it had not prepared. The rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS), Syria’s brutal civil war and instability in Afghanistan led thousands of people to seek safety and security in the European Union. The “long summer of migration” marked the beginning of the so-called refugee crisis in the EU. Yet the EU did not have a clear plan; the European Agenda for Migration, which had been agreed upon in May 2015, had not yet been tested.

Today, the narrative of a crisis continues to shape migration policy across Europe. In Greece, it has served to justify restrictive deterrence measures since 2015, making new crackdowns unsurprising. For Greece’s neoliberal government, migration is a blemish on the narrative of its economic success. In the UK, it is used to fuel far-right sentiment. In both cases, migration policy is crafted not only to deter arrivals but also to satisfy domestic political demands.

Neither migration plan should be viewed in isolation from the rise of the far right across the continent. The adoption of far-right rhetoric surrounding the illegalisation of migrants has been used in both countries to justify inhumane policies. The justification for Greece’s new policy centres on a questionable narrative of an “invasion” from Africa – a trope the Migration Minister has invoked repeatedly. For Greece’s minister of migration, the Greek border, and by extension the European border, must be reinforced so that only “real refugees” can enjoy the benefits of European protection. For the British government, small boats have the power to “undermine [the country’s] border security”, according to Home Secretary Yvette Cooper, and should therefore be prevented from entering.

Although each migration plan is the product of different political processes in Greece, the EU and the UK, their design and the narratives used to justify them are similar in several ways. They both conceptualise the migrant and the border in similar terms. For each state, the migrant is seen as a threat to the border, and the border is viewed as in need of protection. The migrant who reaches each country’s shores is criminalised, and the term “illegal migrant” has gained prominence among government officials. The border, in turn, is seen as a security mechanism that must be defended against those trying to reach it. Together, these approaches create an “us versus them” narrative of division. Migrants are reduced to their migratory identity; they are seen as a mass, and their individual experiences no longer matter. As such, migrants become worthy or unworthy of international protection, desirable or undesirable to the Western nation-state. Only those perceived as “real refugees” are deemed deserving of international protection. The “undesirables” are turned into nothing and are expelled by the border. As a result, a narrative of fear is promoted and a crisis is manufactured.

Although the events at the European border became known as a “refugee crisis”, they were, in fact, a crisis of the European border.

During the border crisis, the European border regime emerged stronger than ever before, and the EU’s neoliberal imagination of a borderless world collapsed. Walls were erected throughout the continent, new border technologies were deployed to deter and expel the “undesirables”, and pushbacks, human rights violations and violence were normalised. Death continues to loom over the European continent’s borders. The UK-France deal may have been described as ground-breaking, but the EU-Turkiye deal in 2016 paved the way for such “swap” policies. These agreements fail. The EU-Turkiye deal may have reduced the number of people crossing the Aegean Sea in the short term; however, it did not stop them. Instead, it shifted migratory routes, opened new ones, and made migratory journeys more complicated and dangerous.

The reason for their failure is simple: human movement cannot be controlled. Arguably, it can be prevented or delayed, but it cannot be stopped.

These policies are rooted in racism and are deliberately designed to create division. Their main aim is to separate human beings and determine who is worthy of living in safety and who should be expelled from Western territory. They should not be viewed in isolation from the EU’s and the UK’s colonial and capitalist pasts. At the same time, the spectacle of the border is fully staged: It produces the illusion of control over a manufactured crisis that cannot truly be controlled. In reality, the essence of migration deterrence is not to succeed but to convince citizens that it is necessary.

598,129,The IPCC: Can it regain its credibility?,https://www.meer.com/en/91051-the-ipcc-can-it-regain-its-credibility,2025-07-29T15:33:09Z,Meer.com,US,mass migration,"Good climate policy depends on good climate science. And good climate science has depended on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) since it was set up by governments in 1988.

The IPCC is made up of tens of thousands of scientists in dozens of countries, covering multiple facets of “why” and “how” the climate is changing. It lays down the consensus-based line in great doorstopper reports every five or six years. So well was it judged to have carried out that remit that in 2007 it was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize alongside former Vice President Al Gore.

Critics of the IPCC see it as being far too slow, always several years behind the reality of what's happening on the front line of our changing climate, and far too susceptible to brutish political pressure from petrostates and the fossil fuel industry. However, if you're looking for an institutional manifestation of what good science looks like in practice, then the IPCC is seen by many as providing that gold standard.

Over the years, it's become very familiar with attacks from climate deniers (serried ranks of pointy-headed flat-earthers have been summarily seen off by the IPCC over the years), more radical, independent scientists (with whom it's maintained a polite “agree to disagree” position), and climate activists, who it rather patronizingly ignores.

But the IPCC is now in real trouble, with a much more problematic opponent: the world's elite actuaries! The driest, dustiest, most unimpeachably authoritative of global professions has chosen to turn its full firepower on the IPCC—and the fallout could (and should!) transform the world of climate science.

In January 2025, without any huge fanfare, the Institute of Faculty and Actuaries published its “Planetary Solvency: Finding our Balance in Nature” report, in partnership with scientists at the University of Exeter. It robustly critiques orthodox economic predictions, which estimate that the impact of an average temperature increase of 3°C by the end of the century would be around 2% of annual GDP. “These estimates are precisely wrong, rather than being roughly right, and do not recognize there is a risk of ruin.” The institute's risk management experts diligently reassessed risks associated with impacts such as fires, flooding, droughts, temperature increases, and rising sea levels through 2050 and on to the end of the century.

There is now a very strong likelihood that we'll experience an average temperature increase of at least 2°C by 2050—an outcome described by the report's authors as “catastrophic.” Take a deep breath and get your head around the projected impacts associated with that 2°C rise:

Economic contraction; GDP loss of over 25%.

Mass human mortality events resulting in over 2 billion deaths.

Warming of 2°C or more triggers a high number of climate tipping points.

Breakdown of some critical ecosystem services and Earth systems.

Major extinction events in multiple geographies.

Ocean circulation was severely impacted.

Severe socio-political fragmentation in many regions; low-lying regions lost.

Heat and water stress are driving the mass migration of billions.

Catastrophic mortality events from disease, malnutrition, thirst, and conflict.

Two billion prospective deaths by 2050. That's just 25 years away. And for the final kicker, bearing in mind that we're currently on a business-as-usual trajectory towards at least a 3.7°C temperature increase by 2100, the contraction in GDP then rises to 50% and the number of projected deaths rises to 4 billion.

The institute's definition of “planetary solvency” is fascinating:

Planetary Solvency” assesses the ongoing ability of the Earth system to support our human society and economy. In the same way that a solvent pension scheme is one that continues to be able to provide pensions, a solvent Earth system is one that continues to provide the natural services we rely on, support ongoing prosperity, and a safe and just future.

The problem is that the IPCC, on behalf of citizens of Planet Earth, does not assess risk in the same way that the managers of pension schemes assess risk for their clients.

Unmitigated climate change and nature-driven risks have been hugely underestimated. Global risk management practices for policy makers are inadequate, and we've accepted much higher levels of risk than is broadly understood.

I'm not sure that the IPCC will welcome being called “precisely wrong rather than roughly right”, especially when it dives down into the details of this devastating critique. It basically stands accused of:

Relying on excessively narrow, reductionist science, based on retrospective “proof points,” without any capacity to cope with uncertainty and more sophisticated risk analysis. Failing to take into account the science of critical tipping points: “waiting for certainty” on whether these critical ecosystems will or won't tip, risks ruin. Slow-moving, static methodologies, which means that its risk assessments are infrequent and seemingly incapable of taking into account irrefutable evidence that the climate is changing far faster than its assessments indicate. Providing false (and therefore very dangerous) reassurance to governments that the scale of the damage done to the global economy by an average temperature increase of 2°C before the end of the century will be “manageable” at around 1.5% of global GDP. This is where the institute accuses the IPCC of being “wholly wrong”.

In due course, I'm sure the IPCC will provide some kind of riposte. When it does, it will need to take into account another equally devastating report from scientists at the Institute for Climate Risk at the University of New South Wales, confirming the actuaries’ hypothesis of underestimated financial risks—simply because the IPCC's Integrated Assessment Models on which it has depended for decades are incapable of capturing major risks—what actuaries describe as risks with “low probability but catastrophic impact.”

As Professor Andy Pitman, one of the co-authors of this report, put it:

It's in the extremes when the rubber hits the road. It isn't about average temperatures. In a hotter future, we can expect cascading supply chain disruptions triggered by extreme weather events worldwide.

Which is, of course, what's already happening, in front of our very eyes, in real time, country after country.

So does some arcane standoff between climate geeks and number-crunching actuaries have any bearing on the real world? It absolutely does! If the IPCC continues to provide governments with seriously flawed assessments of climate risk, furnishing them with every conceivable variety of comfort blanket that protects us from the “whole truth” about accelerating climate change, then there is literally no way governments will ever come up with timely, proportionate responses to the crisis.

And we'll all pay the price for that.

In the meantime, the resurgence of climate denialism in the USA, turbocharged by the Trump Administration's determination to kill off America's burgeoning green industries, is already having predictable consequences.

Amongst others, the big US banks feel liberated from their previous wishy-washy efforts to contribute to Net Zero decarbonization targets—only too keen to extricate themselves from the Net Zero Banking Alliance and other greenwashing exercises of this kind. Reading the political runes, Morgan Stanley recently declared, “We now expect a 3°C world”, without so much as a passing reference to the economic consequences of a 3°C world, not least as there are stupendously rich pickings to be made along the road to the apocalypse.

A recent article in Politico commented on a “mundane Morgan Stanley research report on the future of air conditioning stocks.” The global “cooling market” is already worth $235 billion, and Morgan Stanley analysts now expect this to grow at 7% per annum rather than 3% per annum as the world goes on getting hotter! As climate campaigner Bill McKibben put it, “Confronted with the probability of hell, they're figuring out a way of selling air conditioners to the devil”.

We can expect a lot more of this, with guidance from endless morally bankrupt asset managers and banks about “how to operate profitably as temperatures soar and climate impacts worsen”—how the rich can go on making themselves richer off the end of life on Earth.

And just in case you've already relegated to the back of your mind that analysis from the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries, let me remind you that in a 2°C warmer world, GDP will contract by more than 25%, with “mass human mortality events resulting in over 2 billion deaths.”

Hotter seas can lead to more intense storms, such as Hurricane Milton in 2024 NOAA

Extreme marine heat recorded since 2023 might herald the start of a regime shift in the world’s oceans that poses a grave threat to life on Earth, scientists have warned.

Record-breaking marine heatwaves emerged in the North Atlantic and Pacific oceans in 2023 and were unprecedented in their severity, endurance and geographical scale, with many lasting well over a year.

The heatwaves helped push sea surface temperatures to record-breaking levels around the world in 2023 and 2024, driving extreme warmth and dangerous weather on land and contributing to both years being declared consecutively as the hottest on record.

“We’ve had progressive warming of our oceans over the last 40 to 50 years, but 2023 was a breakout year, with large-scale marine heatwaves affecting so many different locations,” says Matthew England at the University of New South Wales in Australia.

Sea surface temperatures globally are still at near-record levels, and currently the Mediterranean Sea is in the grip of a marine heatwave with water temperatures as much as 5°C (9°F) above normal for the time of year.

Some researchers fear that the world’s oceans have transitioned to a new, hotter state, threatening our ability to accurately predict both short-term weather extremes, such as hurricanes, and long-term climatic shifts.

To find out more about what is going on, Zhenzhong Zeng at the Southern University of Science and Technology in China set out with colleagues to identify the drivers of the 2023 marine heatwaves around the world, analysing the movement of heat, wind and currents in the oceans. Reduced cloud cover, which increases the amount of solar radiation hitting the water, was found to be a key influence, alongside weaker winds and the appearance of a warming El Niño pattern in the Pacific Ocean.

Given the duration of the heat, which began in earnest in 2023 and continues today in some regions, Zeng believes this is the start of a “new normal” for the world’s oceans. He says emerging data indicates the heat in the oceans is accumulating exponentially, a trend that would defy climate model predictions.

Persistently high water temperatures will have a devastating effect on marine life, escalating the threat of coral reef collapse and triggering a mass die-off and migration of marine life. It would also accelerate heating on land, leading to more severe and widespread droughts, heatwaves, wildfires and storms.

Zeng says he is “very scared” by this potential regime shift in the oceans. “I think almost all of the Earth system model projections are wrong,” he says.

But some researchers believe it is still far too early to warn of a fundamental change in ocean dynamics. Neil Holbrook at the University of Tasmania in Australia says there isn’t yet “clear evidence” to support warnings we have reached a tipping point, particularly given there are only a few years of data to assess. “We don’t know what’s going to happen next year, and it [ocean temperatures] might just come back to something that’s much more, let’s say, normal,” he says.

However, Holbrook stressed that unless greenhouse gas emissions are rapidly curtailed, “marine heatwaves around the globe will continue to increase in intensity and duration, and potentially at rates faster than various marine species can adapt”.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,"new scientist, newscientist.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/new-scientist/,,not found,PRO-SCIENCE (-0.5),HIGH (0.5),United Kingdom,,Magazine,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,,,Unknown,Center,Unknown,Unknown,Center,newscientist.com,,new scientist,153,United Kingdom,,,,
600,8,Top EU court strikes a blow against Italy’s Albania migrant camps scheme,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/8/1/top-eu-court-strikes-a-blow-against-italys-albania-migrant-camps-scheme,2025-08-01T14:02:33Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"Italy has signed a deal with Albania, where it planned to process up to 36,000 asylum seekers per year.

The European Union’s top court has backed Italian judges who questioned a list of “safe countries” drawn up by Rome, as it prepares to deport migrants to detention centres in Albania.

The hard-right government of Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni denounced the European Court of Justice’s (ECJ) ruling and said it “weakens policies to combat mass illegal immigration”.

Meloni’s plan to outsource migrant processing to a non-EU country and speed up repatriations of failed asylum seekers has been followed closely by others in the bloc.

The costly scheme has been frozen for months by legal challenges.

Italian magistrates have cited the European court’s decision that EU states cannot designate an entire country as “safe” when certain regions are not.

On Friday, in a long-awaited judgement, the Luxembourg-based ECJ said Italy is free to decide which countries are “safe”, but warned that such a designation should meet strict legal standards and allow applicants and courts to access and challenge the supporting evidence.

In its statement, the ECJ said a Rome court had turned to EU judges, citing the impossibility of accessing such information and thus preventing it from “challenging and reviewing the lawfulness of such a presumption of safety”.

The ECJ also said a country might not be classified “safe” if it does not offer adequate protection to its entire population, agreeing with Italian judges that had raised this issue last year.

Meloni and her Albanian counterpart, Edi Rama, had signed a migration deal in November 2023, and last year, Rome opened two centres in Albania, where it planned to process up to 36,000 asylum seekers per year.

The detention facilities have, however, been empty for months, due to the judicial obstacles. Last week, a report found that their construction cost was seven times more than that of an equivalent centre in Italy.

Government’s approach ‘dismantled’?

The European court made its judgement considering a case of two Bangladeshi nationals who were rescued at sea by Italian authorities and taken to Albania, where their asylum claims were rejected based on Italy’s classification of Bangladesh as a “safe” country.

Dario Belluccio, a lawyer who represented one of the Bangladeshi asylum seekers at the ECJ on Friday, said the Albanian migrant camps scheme had been killed off.

“It will not be possible to continue with what the Italian government had envisioned before this decision … Technically, it seems to me that the government’s approach has been completely dismantled,” he told the Reuters news agency.

Meloni’s office complained that the EU judgement allows national judges to dictate policy on migration, “further reduc(ing) the already limited” capacity of parliament and government to take decisions on the matter.

“This is a development that should concern everybody,” it said.

Meanwhile, though the Albanian scheme is stuck in legal limbo, Italy’s overall effort to curb undocumented migration by sea has been successful.

601,195,Video shows bison leaving Yellowstone in 'mass exodus'?,https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/bison-leaving-yellowstone-video/,2025-07-21T23:02:00Z,Snopes.com,US,mass migration,"Claim: The bison population of Yellowstone National Park was leaving the park in July 2025. Rating: About this rating Miscaptioned

In July 2025, Scott Whitehead, described as an ""animal expert"" in his social media bios, shared a video to his social media accounts of him speaking over a video of a bunch of bison running past a camera. In the video, he claimed that on the morning of July 15, 2025, bison began a ""mass exodus"" out of Yellowstone National Park and ""no one know why.""

The video was liked more than 30,000 times on Instagram (archived), viewed more than 600,000 times on Facebook (archived) and viewed nearly 150,000 times on TikTok (archived).

The video did not actually depict a ""mass exodus"" of bison out of Yellowstone, and there was no evidence the park's bison exhibited such behavior. Whitehead posted several videos falsely claiming animals were migrating out of Yellowstone National Park in July 2025.

A Google search for bison leaving Yellowstone limited to July 2025 found no reputable news article reporting on a mass migration of bison from Yellowstone National Park. Instead, the top result was for an ABC News article reporting that the National Park Service denied that animals were migrating out of Yellowstone in large numbers.

In the comments of Whitehead's Instagram video, a profile with the handle @grant.t.johnson claimed to be the source of the video of bison and denied that the bison were leaving the park in large numbers.

Hi, that's my video you're showing. I think you're kidding around, but judging by a lot of the comments, and many similar videos going viral, it's worth saying unequivocally that the wildlife are NOT leaving the Park. Nothing unusual is happening here in Yellowstone, it's as beautiful and wild as ever.

The video was first posted online by the Instagram account for Yellowstone Safari (archived), which listed Grant Johnson as a photographer on its staff page, and credited him for the video in that post. Yellowstone Safari posted the video on July 1, two weeks before Whitehead posted the video claiming that there was a mass exodus of bison ""this morning.""

Johnson sent Snopes the original video file with the added context that it was recorded in the northeastern part of Yellowstone National Park, in front of the Trout Lake trailhead. A review of the video's metadata confirmed the video was recorded in front of the Trout Lake trailhead on July 1, 2025.

According to Johnson, the bison were moving west — deeper into the park.

Bison do congregate in herds and migrate between different areas of the Yellowstone area throughout the year, according to the National Park Service.

After posting this video, Whitehead made a playlist on his TikTok account (archived) titled ""Yellowstone Migration."" The bison video was the fourth video added to this playlist, all four of which he posted from July 9-15.

603,140,The Big Vitamin D Mistake,https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5541280/,2025-07-27T22:59:56Z,National Institutes of Health,US,mass migration,"Since 2006, type 1 diabetes in Finland has plateaued and then decreased after the authorities’ decision to fortify dietary milk products with cholecalciferol. The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. A statistical error in the estimation of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for vitamin D was recently discovered; in a correct analysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, it was found that 8895 IU/d was needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Another study confirmed that 6201 IU/d was needed to achieve 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/d was needed to reach 100 nmol/L. The largest meta-analysis ever conducted of studies published between 1966 and 2013 showed that 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the previously presumed U-shape curve of mortality associated with vitamin D levels. Since all-disease mortality is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L, we call public health authorities to consider designating as the RDA at least three-fourths of the levels proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses. This could lead to a recommendation of 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for breastfed children older than 6 months, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and around 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter. Actions are urgently needed to protect the global population from vitamin D deficiency.

The incidence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) has been doubling every 20 years. In Finland, the recommendation for daily vitamin D supplementation was gradually reduced from 4000-5000 IU in 1964 to 400 IU in 1992. Concomitantly, T1D increased by 350% in those aged 1-4 years, 100% in those aged 5-9 years, and 50% in those aged 10-14 years [ 1 ]. However, since 2006, T1D has plateaued and decreased after an increase in serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) after the authorities’ decision to fortify all dietary milk products with cholecalciferol [ 2 ]. Moreover, the worldwide association of ultraviolet (UV)-B light and vitamin D status with T1D and multiple sclerosis is now more than evident.

MAIN BODY

Vitamin D and Immunomodulation The role of vitamin D in innate and adaptive immunity is critical. It has been shown that the redirection of human autoreactive T-cells upon interaction with dendritic cells can be modulated by an analog of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D 3 [3]. In a recent plenary session entitled “Cell Therapy in Type 1 Diabetes” that closed the 2016 meeting of the European Society for Paediatric Endocrinology in Paris, Bart O. Roep [3] announced the initiation of phase 1 clinical trials in humans in 2016 with the following protocol: dendritic cells will be isolated from the patient’s peripheral blood, cultured with calcitriol, and then re-injected in an abdominal intradermal position to ‘teach’ the rest of the immune cells not to attack β-cells anymore. In a large birth cohort study, T1D incidence was reduced by 78% with 2000 IU of cholecalciferol per day [4]. Moreover, T1D autoantibodies can be “negativated” with oral calcitriol [5]. Vitamin D levels >100 nmol/L (40 ng/mL with a conversion factor of ×2.5) improve insulin secretion [6] and prevent β-cell destruction by suppressing macrophage adhesion and migration through downregulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and scavenger receptor-A1 [7].

The Statistical Error in the Estimation of the Recommended Dietary Allowance of Vitamin D Veugelers and Ekwaru [8], in a correct reanalysis of the data used by the Institute of Medicine, proved that 8895 IU/d are needed for 97.5% of individuals to achieve values ≥50 nmol/L. Heaney et al. [9] confirmed that finding, reporting that 6201 IU/d were needed to achieve the Endocrine Society’s recommendation of 75 nmol/L and 9122 IU/day to reach 100 nmol/L.

What Serum Vitamin D Levels Should We Aim for? Garland et al. [10] published the largest meta-analysis ever conducted of all studies published between January 1, 1966 and January 15, 2013 dealing with all-cause mortality related to serum 25(OH)D, showing that 25(OH)D levels <75 nmol/L may be too low for safety and associated with higher all-cause mortality, demolishing the U-shape curve of vitamin D levels and mortality that had been assumed until then.

Call to Public Health Authorities Since all-disease (autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, cancer) mortality risk is reduced to 1.0 with serum vitamin D levels ≥100 nmol/L [10], we call all responsible public health authorities to consider designating as the recommended dietary allowance (i.e., the average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all healthy people, presuming minimal sun exposure) intake levels corresponding to those proposed by the Endocrine Society Expert Committee (2011) as safe upper tolerable daily intake doses for patients at risk for vitamin D deficiency (<50 nmol/L): 2000 IU for those <1 year of age, 4000 IU for those aged 1-18 years, and 10 000 IU for those aged >18 years. Since 10 000 IU/d is needed to achieve 100 nmol/L [9], except for individuals with vitamin D hypersensitivity, and since there is no evidence of adverse effects associated with serum 25(OH)D levels <140 nmol/L, leaving a considerable margin of safety for efforts to raise the population-wide concentration to around 100 nmol/L, the doses we propose could be used to reach the level of 75 nmol/L or preferably 100 nmol/L. Of course, these recommended doses can be individualized based on dietary and sun exposure habits and the latitude of the country, and they can also be adjusted according to body mass index, age, and skin color, with obese, elderly, and dark-skinned people needing higher doses.

Explanation of the Pandemic of Vitamin D Deficiency Only 20% of our vitamin D reserve is meant to come from the diet. The remaining 80% is expected to be produced in our skin from the UV-B of the sun. In contrast to the context of the recommendations of the 1960s of 4000 to 5000 IU/d to avoid rickets, our diet today is poor in wild fish (×10 richer in vitamin D), wild eggs, and fresh milk. Children are playing and people are working indoors all day long, and powerful sunprotective cosmetics are used to prevent melanoma. Even sunny countries such as Greece present a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, as the angle of the sun rays from autumn to spring do not result in sufficient vitamin D production with usual sun exposure.

Optimal Vitamin D Supplementation With the target for vitamin D set at 100 nmol/L, the dose, frequency, and duration of supplementation will be important factors for healthy subjects committed to optimizing their nutritional status. Since in the case of vitamin D, serum levels depend on dietary intake (20%) and sun exposure (80%), a practical approach would be to recommend at least the three-fourths of the upper tolerable dose proposed by the Endocrine Society to be taken as a supplement all year long except for circumstances such as vacations in which one engages in sunbathing. This could translate to, for instance, 1000 IU for children <1 year on enriched formula and 1500 IU for those older than 6 months who are breastfed, 3000 IU for children >1 year of age, and up to 8000 IU for young adults and thereafter, with non-pediatric doses adapted to the body mass index with the target set to 100 nmol/L instead of 50 nmol/L. More importantly, according to the Endocrine Society’s clinical practice guidelines, doses up to 1000 IU/d for infants up to 6 months, 1500 IU/d for infants from 6 months to 1 year, 2500 IU/d for children aged 1-3 years, 3000 IU/d for children aged 4-8 years, and 4000 IU/d for everyone over 8 years can be given safely without medical supervision just to prevent vitamin D deficiency, while higher doses may be needed to correct hypovitaminosis D.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,"national institutes of health, NIH  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/national-institutes-of-health-nih/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/national-institutes-health-media-bias-0,PRO-SCIENCE (-0.5),HIGH (0.5),USA,,Organization/Foundation,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Not Rated,,,,,,Unknown,Center,Unknown,Unknown,Center,pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov,,national institutes of health,151,USA,,,,

Photo By Andy Rain/EPA

July 15 (UPI) -- Thousands of Afghans were relocated to Britain in a secret government scheme after a data breach of nearly 100,000 refugee applicants via Afghanistan following the Taliban's 2021 seizure of power.

A British judge suggested it ultimately created ""serious"" concern over free speech and an independent media.

It was revealed Tuesday by British authorities that the private data of nearly 19,000 people was leaked ""in error"" in February 2022 by a Ministry of Defense official, containing applicant names and other personal details part of the government's so-called ""Afghan Relocations and Assistance Policy.""

As a result, the prior government under then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak initiated last year in April a secret Afghan relocation program styled as the ""Afghanistan Response Route.""

As of March, about 36,000 people have been resettled in the island nation under ARAP and other similar resettlement plans.

The now-defunct ARAP program was launched in April 2021 and ended earlier this month after immigration policy adjustments by parliament.

Nearly 100,000 people, including family members of ARAP applicants, were said to be affected by the incident and could be at risk of harassment, torture or even death if the information got into Taliban hands, a judge said last year in June.

It's understood so far to have cost more than $535 million with an estimated final price tag of over $1.1 billion between legal fees, compensation and other related costs.

In September 2023, a rare superinjunction was given by a High Court to prevent British media from reporting on the story in a request by then-Defense Minister Ben Wallace to cut back on the risk of notifying Taliban warlords.

On Tuesday, the super injunction was lifted. It's thought to be the longest judicial order of its kind and the first time the British government had sought such a restrictive act against the free press.

According to officials, the dataset left osecure government computer servers while the unnamed defense official allegedly attempted to verify information.

Reports indicate around 4,500 individuals have so far arrived to British shores or in transit via the government's ""Afghanistan Response Route.""

It includes some 900 Arap applicants and roughly 3,600 of their family members.

An independent government review commission, seated this year in January, concluded in June that the data was ""unlikely to significantly shift Taliban understanding of individuals who may be of interest to them.""

In 2021, a government whistleblower testified to Britain's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office over the Afghanistan withdrawal of British troops months prior in August.

British authorities later paid out nearly $1 million in compensation for almost 300 civilian deaths during the Afghanistan conflict.

Whistleblower testimony revealed that ""between 75,000 and 150,000"" Afghan allies had applied for emergency evacuation out of Afghanistan as the Taliban took control, but fewer than 5% received foreign assistance.

British government officials only became aware of the data breach over a year later when excerpts appeared on Facebook.

""This data leak should never have happened and was an unacceptable breach of all relevant data protocols,"" James Cartlidge, the shadow defense minister who sat in Sunak's government when the scheme was hatched, told the BBC on Tuesday.

Defense Minister John Healy offered a ""sincere apology on behalf of the British government"" for the leak in remarks to the House of Commons.

However, the situation overall didn't sit well with the judge who stated that by granting his own super injunction, it had ""given rise to serious free speech concerns.""

""The superinjunction had the effect of completely shutting down the ordinary mechanisms of accountability which operate in a democracy,"" Justice Martin Chamberlain said in his summary judgment.

""This led to what I describe as a 'scrutiny vacuum,'"" he added.",GNews,-1.15,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/upi-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,45.3,"upi news, United Press International, UPI, upi.com",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-press-international-upi/,https://ground.news/interest/upi_0b956e,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/united-press-international-media-bias,LEAST BIASED (1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,News Agency,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,,,,Center,Very High,Center,Center,Left,Center,Center,upi.com,,upi news,2,USA,Y,J,UPI News,Y
606,8,Inside Iran’s crackdown on Afghan migrants after the war with Israel,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/22/inside-irans-crackdown-on-afghan-migrants,2025-07-22T11:15:16Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"Before the war, the official number of Afghan refugees and migrants in Iran was at least 6.1 million people; only about 780,000 have been given refugee status.

Tehran, Iran – The wave of Afghan refugees and migrants being sent back from Iran has not stopped, with more than 410,000 being pushed out since the end of the 12-day war with Israel on June 24.

More than 1.5 million Afghan refugees and migrants have been sent back in 2025, according to the United Nations’ International Organization for Migration (IOM), while the Red Cross says more than one million people more could be sent back by the end of the year.

Iran has been hosting Afghans for decades. While it has periodically expelled irregular arrivals, it has now taken its efforts to unprecedented levels after the war with Israel that killed more than 1,000 people in Iran, many of them civilians.

Iran has also been building a wall along its massive eastern borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan to stem the flow of irregular migration, and smuggled drugs and fuel.

The parliament is also planning for a national migration organisation that would take over its efforts to crack down on irregular migration.

‘I’m afraid’

“I feel like we’re being singled out because we’re easy targets and don’t have many options,” said Ahmad*, a 27-year-old undocumented Afghan migrant who came to Iran four years ago.

Like others, he had to work construction and manual labour jobs before managing to get hired as the custodian of an old residential building in the western part of the capital, Tehran.

At the current rate of Iran’s heavily devalued currency, he gets paid the equivalent of about $80 a month, which is wired to the bank card of an Iranian citizen because he cannot have an account in his name.

He has a small spot where he can sleep in the building and tries to send money to his family in Afghanistan whenever possible.

“I don’t really leave the building that much because I’m afraid I’ll be sent back. I don’t know how much longer I can live like this,” he told Al Jazeera.

Vahid Golikani, who heads the foreign nationals’ department of the governor’s office in Tehran, told state media last week that undocumented migrants must not be employed to protect local labour.

Daily returns, which include expulsions and voluntary returns, climbed steeply after the start of the war, with average daily returns exceeding 29,600 in the week starting July 10, said Mai Sato, UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran.

She was among four special rapporteurs who decried the mass returns on Thursday, adding their voice to rights organisations such as Amnesty International.

“Afghanistan remains unsafe under Taliban rule. These mass returns violate international law and put vulnerable people, especially women, children, and minorities, at severe risk of persecution and violence,” Sato said.

Alleged security risks

Authorities and state media have said undocumented immigrants may pose a security risk, alleging that some of them were paid by Israel to carry out tasks inside Iran.

While state television has aired confessions from a handful of unidentified imprisoned Afghans, but their numbers do not seem to match the scale of the expulsions.

The televised confessions featured men with covered eyes and blurred-out faces saying they had sent photographs and information online to anonymous handlers linked with Mossad.

Hundreds of Iranians have also been arrested on suspicion of working for Israel, and several Iranians have been executed over the past weeks as the government works to increase legal punishments for spying.

Mohammad Mannan Raeesi, a member of parliament from the ultraconservative city of Qom, said during a state television interview last week, “We don’t have a single migrant from Afghanistan among the Israeli spies.”

He pointed out that some Afghans have fought and died for Iran, and that attempts to expel irregular arrivals should avoid xenophobia.

Economic pressures

Before the latest wave of forced returns, Iranian authorities reported the official number of Afghan refugees and migrants at a whopping 6.1 million, with many speculating the real number was much higher.

Only about 780,000 have been given official refugee status by the government.

Supporting millions of refugees and migrants, regular and irregular, takes a toll on a government that spends billions annually on hidden subsidies on essentials like fuel, electricity and bread for everyone in the country.

Since 2021, there have been complaints among some Iranians about the economic impact of hosting millions who poured into Iran unchecked in the aftermath of the Taliban’s chaotic takeover of Afghanistan.

Amid increasing hostility towards the Afghan arrivals over the past years, local newspapers and social media have increasingly highlighted reports of crimes like theft and rape allegedly committed by Afghan migrants. However, no official statistics on such crimes have been released.

That has not stopped some Iranians, along with a large number of anonymous accounts online, from cheering on the mass returns, with popular hashtags in Farsi on X and other social media portraying the returns as a “national demand”.

Again, there are no reliable statistics or surveys that show what portion of the Iranian population backs the move, or under what conditions.

Some tearful migrants told Afghan media after being returned from Iran that security forces beat or humiliated them while putting them on buses to the border.

Others said they were abruptly deported with only the clothes on their back, and were unable to get their last paycheques, savings, or downpayments made for their rented homes.

Some of those with legal documentation have not been spared, as reports emerged in recent weeks of Afghan refugees and migrants being deported after having their documents shredded by police.

Government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani and Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni have separately said the government is only seeking undocumented migrants.

“In cases where legal residents have been deported, those instances have been investigated,” Momeni said last week, adding that over 70 percent of those returned came forward voluntarily after the government set a deadline to leave for early July.

‘I sense a lot of anger among the people’

For those Afghans who remain in Iran, a host of other restrictions make life difficult.

They are barred from entering dozens of Iranian cities. Their work permits may not be renewed every year, or the renewal fees could be hiked suddenly. They are unable to buy property, cars or even SIM cards for their mobile phones.

They are seldom given citizenship and face difficulties in getting their children into Iranian schools.

Zahra Aazim, a 22-year-old teacher and video editor of Afghan origin based in Tehran, said she did not truly feel the extent of the restrictions associated with living in Iran for Afghans until a few years ago.

Her family migrated to Iran about 45 years ago, shortly after Iran’s 1979 Islamic revolution that brought the incumbent theocratic establishment to power.

“What really bugs me is the fact that I was born in Iran, and my family has been living here for over four decades, but I’m still unable to get something as basic as a driver’s licence.

“That’s not to mention fundamental documents like a national ID card or an Iran-issued birth certificate,” she told Al Jazeera.

By law, those documents are reserved for Iranian nationals. Afghan-origin people can apply if their mother is Iranian or if they are a woman married to an Iranian man.

Aazim said Iran’s rules have only gotten stricter over the years. But things took a sharp turn after the war, and she has received hundreds of threatening or insulting messages online since.

“I’ve been hearing from other Afghan-origin friends in Iran … that this is no longer a place where we can live,” she said.

“A friend called me with the same message after the war. I thought she meant she’s thinking about moving to another country or going back to Afghanistan. I never thought her last resort would be [taking her own life].”

Aazim also said her 23-year-old brother was taken by police from a Tehran cafe – and later released – on suspicion of espionage.

The incident, along with videos of violence against Afghans that are circulating on social media, has made her feel unsafe.

“I sense a lot of anger among the Iranian people, even in some of my Iranian friends. When you can’t lash out against those in power above, you start to look for people at lower levels to blame,” she said.

“I’m not saying don’t take any action if you have security concerns about Afghan migrants … I just wish they would treat us respectfully.

“Respect has nothing to do with nationality, ethnicity or geography.”

607,27,Danish PM Tells EU That Mass Migration Hurts Disadvantaged Europeans,https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2025/07/11/danish-pm-tells-eu-that-mass-migration-hurts-disadvantaged-europeans-the-most/,2025-07-11T09:46:57Z,Breitbart News,US,mass migration,"Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen addressed EU Parliamentarians to stress that the European project can only work if national distinctions and borders are respected, arguing that the mass migration agenda over the past decade has hurt the most disadvantaged people in European societies.

Prime Minister Frederiksen, who is charting a new course in the EU as an anti-mass migration leader of a left-wing Social Democrat party, defended her country’s third-way approach to governance in a speech at the European Parliament in Strasbourg on Tuesday.

Marking the start of Denmark’s control of the rotating presidency of the Council of the European Union, Frederiksen stated that while she believes in the EU project, she is not willing to forsake her country’s national identity or the protection of its borders for the sake of international cooperation.

“For me, there is only one way forward, and that is Europe. Europe, Europe, Europe,” she declared, but added, “I would like to make it very clear that my prerequisite for being able to say Europe is that I am very proud of my fatherland.”

“I am Danish before I am anything else,” Frederiksen said.

The Danish PM did lay out some red meat for progressives during her speech, including on the need for funding the Ukraine war and the green agenda. However, she also explained why, as a progressive, she believes in strong borders.

While she noted that her line differs with other Social Democrats in Strasbourg, she said: “It is precisely because I am a Social Democrat that I believe in and fight for a tight immigration policy because the people who pay the price of high crime levels in European cities and the insecurity that this uncontrolled migration has contributed are the European people who are most disadvantaged.”

Migration is “challenging Europe, affecting people’s lives, and the cohesion of our societies,” she said. “European citizens have a right to feel secure in their own countries, that is why we need to strengthen our external borders, lower the influx of migrants to Europe, we need to help stabilise Europe’s neighbouring countries, and make the process of returns easier and more efficient.”

Frederiksen and others in Denmark have also long argued that limiting immigration is essential to protecting the viability of the country’s large welfare state.

“What has been mainstream among our populations for quite many years is now mainstream for many of us politicians as well, finally… maybe not in the [European] Parliament, but gladly, and I’m really happy about that, at the European Council.”

During her address, Frederiksen quipped several times about how her novel policy approach drew either applause from the left or the right, depending on the topic.

Despite coming from differing ends of the political spectrum, the Danish PM has partnered with figures such as Italy’s Giorgia Meloni in pushing for the EU to adopt Rome’s plan of using third-party countries to house illegal migrants rather than allowing them to stay in Europe while their asylum claims are processed.

Denmark has also served as inspiration for other anti-mass migration populists in Europe, such as Geert Wilders in the Netherlands, who has backed calls for the Dutch to receive a similar “opt out” of EU immigration policy that Denmark secured in the early 1990s.

Given that Brussels’ diktats on immigration do not bind Denmark, Copenhagen has been able to enact much stricter requirements, particularly on issues such as chain migration and the return of refugees.

Indeed, a 2020 survey of 56 nations by the Migration Policy Index found that Denmark had the strictest family reunification requirements and the fourth lowest rate of allowing permanent residence for refugees, only trailing Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.

Denmark has also been a leader in publishing in-depth crime statistics, including the nationality and immigration status of offenders, a trend that Germany has recently followed.",NewsAPI,13.55,,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Mixed,31.01,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/,https://ground.news/interest/breitbart,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/breitbart,RIGHT (8.1),MIXED (6.4),USA,,Website,High Traffic,LOW CREDIBILITY,Right,Breitbart News Network LLC,2007,6,Right,Mixed,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,breitbart.com,,breitbart news,41,USA,Y,H,Breitbart,
608,112,"Islanders of Tuvalu Prepare first Mass Migration because of Sea Level Rise, as ICJ grants them Right to Sue",https://www.juancole.com/2025/07/islanders-migration-because.html,2025-07-26T04:15:12Z,Juancole.com,US,mass migration,"Ann Arbor (Informed Comment) – The entire nation of Tuvalu, 11,000 people, is making preparations to relocate, reports Sophie Mak at Nikkei Asia . The nine atolls making up Tuvalu are for the most part only two feet above sea level, which is rising as our carbon dioxide emissions are causing surface ice to melt and ocean water volumes to expand because of added heat.

Tuvalu’s dilemma is not just a shame. It is a crime — a crime committed primarily by the United States and Britain in modern history. The guilt of the US is compounded by its actions during the past thirty years, when its companies and scientists and politicians knew that our tens of billions of annual metric tons of CO2 emissions cause global heating. These US business and political interests engaged in a sophisticated campaign of denialism that continues today, when ExxonMobil, Koch and other Big Oil interests have captured the Republican Party and destroyed the push made by the Biden administration finally to move the country toward low-carbon energy.

We have built in more tens of billions of annual emissions for decades to come, certainly pushing the world past a 1.5º C. (2.7º F.) increase in the average global surface temperature over pre-industrial times. Climate scientists fear that going past that watershed risks throwing the world’s climate into chaos, a chaos that will only increase in severity with every degree we heat up the earth thereafter. It is worth fighting against every degree of increase, since the less the world warms the fewer catastrophes our children and grandchildren will face. But Trumpism has probably doomed us to surge past this first landmark.

And that is why fully half of Tuvalu’s capital, Funafuti, is in danger of being submerged within twenty-five years. Since we will get anywhere from four to six feet of sea level rise within one human lifetime, Tuvalu’s demise is already built in.

Australia is offering residency visas to the people of Tuvalu, allowing several hundred people a year to come to study or work. The arrangement envisages that many will return home after some years, but I think everyone knows that there will be little to return to after a while. Already, half the islanders have applied for this Australian visa. All 11,000 and their descendants are going to have to find somewhere else to live.

Tuvalu is disappearing due to climate change and locals are moving to Australia | 7.30

Australia didn’t make the offer to Tuvalu out of the goodness of Canberra’s heart. China is sniffing around the South Pacific islands looking to lease naval bases and had approached Tuvalu, which was traditionally pro-West and pro-Taiwan. But now the people of Tuvalu are set to lose everything, and it would be nice to have a windfall of Chinese yuan in return for a base, to cushion their losses.

So Australia engaged in preemptive diplomacy and offered these residency permits on condition that Tuvalu subordinate its foreign policy to Australia. The Tuvaluans granted residency permits will have to get jobs and pay their own way, but those that do will be earning hard currency and likely putting down a marker for a future life in Australia.

It is ironic that these dramatic developments are occurring in the South Pacific at the very moment when the International Court of Justice, the main judicial body of the United Nations, has written that:

355. “The Court notes that many participants voiced strong concerns about sea level rise and its implications, especially for the stability of maritime zones. They contend that sea level rise should not have the effect of diminishing the maritime entitlements of States. They argue that existing baselines, maritime entitlements, maritime delimitations and statehood should be preserved, notwithstanding the physical effects of sea level rise, including coastal recession. They further contend that the complete submergence of their territory should not deprive them of their maritime entitlements.

356. “The Court notes that the IPCC has described sea level rise as “unavoidable” and has concluded with a high level of confidence that, as a result, the risks for coastal ecosystems, people and infrastructure will continue to increase (IPCC, 2023 Summary for Policymakers, p. 15, Statement B.2.2) . . .

363. “Several participants argued that sea level rise also poses a significant threat to the territorial integrity and thus to the very statehood of small island States. In their view, in the event of the complete loss of a State’s territory and the displacement of its population, a strong presumption in favour of continued statehood should apply. In the view of the Court, once a State is established, the disappearance of one of its constituent elements would not necessarily entail the loss of its statehood . . .

365. “The Court concludes from the foregoing that the legal obligation to co-operate requires States, in the context of sea level rise, to work together with a view to achieving equitable solutions, taking into account the rights of affected States and those of their populations.”

I read them to be saying that the people of Tuvalu will continue to constitute a nation and to own any mineral or other resources under their atolls even if the waters rise above the islands and that other states have a responsibility to find ways of making reparations to them for their loss of a homeland. I think it is implied that Tuvaluans could prevail in a lawsuit at the ICJ against the carbon polluters. Though how you could get Trump to pay up isn’t clear, and has never been clear if you follow the history of his stiffing his own contractors.

The Tuvaluans are only the tip of the iceberg, alas. Hundreds of millions of us are likely to be displaced from our homes by global heating and its effects over the next few decades. That toll will only rise if we don’t stop driving gasoline cars, burning coal and fossil gas for electricity and heating, and if we don’t find less carbon-intensive ways to build buildings, farm and engage in other essential activities.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,"Juan Cole, juancole.com, Informed Comment (Juan Cole)",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/informed-comment/,,not found,LEFT,MOSTLY FACTUAL,USA,,Website,Minimal Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,,,,,,,Unknown,Left,Unknown,Unknown,Left,juancole.com,juancole.com,juancole.com,104,USA,,,,
609,8,The Egyptians finding a ‘second home’ after migrating south to Tanzania,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/23/the-egyptians-finding-a-second-home-after-migrating-south-to-tanzania,2025-07-23T08:19:38Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"As Europe fortifies its borders, growing numbers of North Africans are moving southwards into other African countries.

Cairo, Egypt – When Ahmed Ginah first left his village in Egypt’s northern delta for the Tanzanian capital in 2017, it was with little more than a dream. Four years later, he named his company after that dream.

“When I first came to Tanzania at 28, no one imagined why I would head south,” Ginah, who is lightheartedly called the “Mayor of Egyptians in Dar-es-Salaam”, told Al Jazeera, saying that in the minds of many of his friends and family back home, countries in sub-Saharan Africa are tainted by stereotypes of famine, poverty and disease.

But when Ginah arrived, what he found were opportunities – and a chance to build something new.

“In 2021, I established my company, Dream [Trading],” he said, in recognition of his “dream” to be a success. He set it up with savings of $3,000, tapping into a growing market importing and exporting aluminium household goods. As the years progressed, he expanded into the steel business.

But beyond work, the 36-year-old is also somewhat of a benevolent godfather figure for other North African migrants making the journey southward.

Ginah has a standard daily routine. Every morning, his driver, Hamed, drops him off at the household goods warehouses attached to Dream Trading. A while later, he drives him to City Mall, the most popular shopping centre in Dar es Salam’s Kariakoo neighbourhood.

Ginah is a regular at the Somali cafe there, where he sits until about noon, meeting other Egyptians and Tanzanians, often over a breakfast of mandazi – deep-fried dough fritters dusted with powdered sugar – or a chipsi mayai, a popular street food omelette with French fries, tomato sauce and vegetables.

Typically, Egyptians who move to Tanzania already have a relative or friend living there. For those who don’t, Ginah helps them find a place to stay, sometimes offering them a job at Dream and helping cover their rent if they’re an employee. He also introduces them to the work system in Tanzania, and gives them a lay of the land about cities where they can potentially work.

“However, the most important thing I provide,” said Ginah, “is a trusted, guaranteed translator.” In urban centres in Tanzania, people speak English. But many village residents only speak Swahili. This could lead to misunderstandings and expose newcomers to “fraud or scams”, Ginah said, so he lends a helping hand.

But Ginah is determined to help only those who want to help themselves.

“I help those who come to work, not those who lie on their laurels and delegate the work to the translator or others,” he said. “In such cases, I advise the person that this country has a lot to offer, but it doesn’t give to the lazy or dependent.”

Ginah has gained a lot in eight years. Today, his company distributes products throughout Africa, and he has helped dozens of young men from his home village relocate and establish themselves in Tanzania, where an estimated 70,000 Arabs live – including 1,200 Egyptians, according to figures provided by Egypt’s ambassador to the country, Sherif Ismail, in 2023.

South-south migration

While Europe fortifies its borders against North African migrants, ambitious young Egyptians in a struggling economy are looking for alternatives to emigrating to the West, according to Ayman Zohry, a demographer and expert on migration studies at the American University in Cairo.

This south-bound migration has accelerated significantly in recent years.

Official statistics show the number of Egyptians in non-Arab African countries increased from 46,000 in 2017 to 54,000 by 2021.

This trend stands in stark contrast to the perilous journeys many Egyptians still make across the Mediterranean. In 2023, Egyptians represented more than 7 percent of all arrivals in Italy along the Central Mediterranean route, making them the fifth most common nationality, according to a report by the Mixed Migration Centre.

The European Union recently responded with a new 7.4 billion euro ($8.7bn) agreement with Egypt, partly aimed at boosting border controls to reduce irregular migration to Europe.

Zohry explained that Egypt’s youth migration trends are undergoing a notable transformation.

“While traditional destinations were the Gulf and Europe, there is a new trend towards the south, specifically some African countries,” Zohry told Al Jazeera.

“Economic migration” sees young people seeking investment opportunities in emerging and promising markets. “This trend has grown in tandem with the expansion of the Egyptian government’s diplomatic and commercial relations with several African countries.”

However, Zohry said, migration to Africa is often circular or temporary. “This means that the migrant returns to Egypt after a short period, or moves between several countries according to available opportunities.”

The back-and-forth flow is evident every Friday night in Dar-es-Salaam, as an aeroplane takes off from Julius Nyerere airport, heading to Cairo.

During high seasons like Eid al-Adha or Eid al-Fitr, whole families fill the departure gates, as Egyptians take their earnings home to visit family, contribute to building a new home, prepare a family member for marriage, or help their parents fulfil a dream of performing the Hajj pilgrimage.

‘Open to Egyptian skills’

Across the African continent, diaspora communities of Arabs and North Africans are growing.

South Africa accounts for the highest percentage of Egyptian residents in Africa, accounting for 85 percent, followed by Nigeria, Kenya and Senegal.

Ginah recounts a story from the late 1990s which has since become an urban legend among youth seeking greener pastures in Africa.

“A young man went to South Africa on vacation to visit a friend. Bizarrely, he was arrested in Cape Town for a visa irregularity,” said Ginah. “When he was released, he was broke. All he had were some aluminium utensils, so he sold them to make enough money to buy a ticket home.”

That’s when the word got out, he says, and people discovered the huge demand for Egyptian aluminium household goods. Young people realised they could make money – and that’s how the home appliance and home goods trade between Egypt and other African countries picked up. Since then, Egyptian business interests across the continent have diversified to include manufacturing, agricultural processing, and mining.

Although North Africans have long travelled south, the trend surged following the 2011 mass uprisings in Egypt and the ensuing political, economic and social change, Ginah says.

“There was a new wave of emigration within Africa – both [to] South Africa and other countries in sub-Saharan Africa – as the Gulf and Libya were greatly affected by the political turmoil.”

Locally, migrants have also found a more friendly working environment, many say.

The government of Tanzania has made strides to support entrepreneurship and foreign investment. According to Lloyds Bank country profile, foreign investors can benefit from many fiscal and non-fiscal incentives.

“Tanzania has natural resources and significant investment opportunities,” said Makame Iddi Makame, the commissioner general and chief of staff at the Tanzanian embassy in Cairo.

He said the country established the Tanzania Investment Centre to manage investment affairs. This includes reducing customs duties to 5 percent in priority sectors and 0 percent in leading sectors; providing tax exemption on mining, agricultural, and industrial inputs; facilitating the issuance of residence, work and business permits, and the repatriation of capital gains abroad; and deferring taxes and VAT for loss-making projects for up to five years.

The country’s political stability also provides a high degree of investment security, as there is low inflation (4.2 percent) and stable exchange rates, he added.

“Given the limited opportunities within Egypt, some African countries may appear less competitive but are more open to Egyptian skills in sectors like construction, agriculture, education, and information technology,” according to migration expert Zohry.

Yet, despite the potential opportunities and generally more welcoming atmosphere, migration to African countries is still limited, compared with the Gulf and Europe, he added, due to a stigmatised mental image many North Africans have about the rest of the continent.

However, there are signs the continent may become a gradual alternative for some youth seeking opportunities beyond traditional borders.

Business opportunities, shared friendships

Some 550km (340 miles) southeast of Dar-es-Salaam is Mayan village.

There, Mohamed el-Shafie, 34, another Egyptian, built two cashew-processing factories in the Mtwara region in 2018, tapping into a strategic crop that accounts for 10-15 percent of Tanzania’s foreign exchange earnings.

“Cashew sales are built purely on trust,” el-Shafei told Al Jazeera. “The cashew growing and harvesting operation is meticulous and requires sensitive handling by farm workers to produce a pure cashew nut. This is followed by the ‘processing’ stage to prepare it for export in good condition.”

Tanzania is one of Africa’s leading producers and exporters of cashew nuts, ranking among the top three on the continent and eighth globally.

El-Shafei’s company has customers across the Arab world and Turkiye, and employs some 400 Egyptian, Chinese and Tanzanian workers, besides the seasonal labourers hired during the cashew harvest season in October.

His foray into the cashew industry was accidental, said el-Shafei, who studied Chinese as an undergraduate at Cairo University, before moving to Beijing to continue his education.

“At the time, I had a lot of Vietnamese friends who worked in the cashew industry. That was when I learned that Tanzania had a promising business opportunity and that Chinese equipment specialised in cashew crop processing was a gap that I could fill,” he said.

With a little help from his friends, he connected with cashew farmers in Tanzania in late 2017, and with a small capital investment of 200,000 Egyptian pounds (about $11,000 back then), el-Shafei set up shop and imported two cashew processing machines from China to start the business. In 2023-2024, Elshafei Investment Limited had made 13 export shipments with a total value of approximately $719,700.

El-Shafei decided to relocate his small family to Dar-es-Salaam so his young children would not be far from him. Today, they all live amid the Arab and Egyptian community, as well as Tanzanians of Yemeni, Omani, and Iranian origin who moved there during the Arab rule before the 1964 Zanzibar Revolution.

Egyptians in Tanzania are not isolated from the local population, el-Shafei says.

“We share celebrations and holidays such as the July 7 Saba Saba Day, which marks the founding of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) in 1954, a significant step towards independence and nation-building. We also celebrate Swahili Language Day and Eid al-Adha through communal meals held in cashew farm villages,” he says.

For Ginah, living in Dar-es-Salaam with his wife and children, Egyptians are part of the fabric of their new community.

“We maintain good relationships with Tanzanians, and we share friendships,” he said, including meeting at work, mosques and social clubs.

But amid the successes, there are also difficult moments in living far from home, he said.

“The pain of alienation hits hardest when someone dies. We [Egyptian immigrants] know each other well, whether in East or West African countries, so it’s very difficult. We immediately band together to make arrangements for the body to be repatriated, and we support the family financially and emotionally, whether they remain in Tanzania or return home to Egypt.”

But when there is family by your side, “the feeling of alienation disappears,” Ginah said. And thanks to technology, “we can see family and friends on a daily basis on mobile phone calls.”

Ginah feels Tanzania is the country where he was destined to make his living.

“It has certainly become a second home for me, where my children are growing up,” he said. “When will I return to my homeland, I don’t know.”

It had been five years since the first of the frog eggs had been moved, carefully plucked from Mexico's Baja Peninsula and transported by cooler to Southern California. Anny Peralta-Garcia was getting nervous.

The eggs belonged to California red-legged frogs, an amphibian that had been eaten, bulldozed and eventually pushed out of the state decades earlier. Peralta-Garcia, an Ensenada-based conservation biologist, had helped harvest fresh eggs from a pond in Baja. The efforts to move them back to the frogs' historic range in California had been monumental — involving private landowners, federal agencies, conservation groups, helicopters and an international border.

And now, 87 more moved egg masses later, everyone was waiting to see if it worked. If the re-introduced frogs were breeding.

""We were like, okay, if frogs reach sexual maturity in two years, maybe three, maybe four, we should be seeing something,"" Peralta-Garcia says. ""But then, third year, fourth year, nothing.""

Finally this year, the scientists tried something new to listen in on the frogs: Artificial Intelligence. A customized AI model sifted through thousands of hours of audio recordings from the relocation sites and picked out the sound of mature male frogs calling – grunting more like – at their new location.

It was the first time the California red-legged frog had been heard in the wilds of San Diego County in 25 years, and a new egg mass soon followed.

It's the latest example of how new technologies like AI are helping muddy-boot biologists and wildlife conservationists fight an ever-worsening extinction crisis .

""It's been like an impossible dream since the 90's to actually be able to go out and see wild frogs at these sites again,"" says Robert Fisher, a biologist with the U.S. Geological Survey.

Here's how it happened.

The celebrated jumping frog of Calaveras County

At about five inches in size, the California red-legged frog is the largest native frog species west of the Rocky Mountains. It used to be found in ponds and waterways, from northern Baja California, in Mexico, to above San Francisco Bay, with populations as far inland as the Sierra Nevada Mountains.

The frog's prevalence made it a popular food source in the 1800s and for miners during the California Gold Rush, says Bennett Hardy, an amphibian ecologist at the San Diego Natural History Museum. ""It was kind of the hot cuisine at the time,"" he says.

The frog leaped to national fame with Mark Twain's short story The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County , which helped launch his writing career.

But the next 150-or-so years weren't so great. Wetlands were drained for agriculture and homes. Streams were dammed, diseases struck and the American bullfrog, a fearsome predator and the largest native frog east of the Rocky Mountains, was introduced.

In 1996, the California red-legged frog was listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act.

""It's now occupying less than 70 percent of its historic range,"" says Susan North, director of stewardship for The Nature Conservancy in California. That includes a stretch from Los Angeles to northern Baja California with zero populations.

""So that's a 260-mile gap in the range of the species,"" she says. ""With a gap that size, you're not going to have five-inch frogs re-colonizing their range naturally.""

A group was formed in the mid-2000s, including the Nature Conservancy,, and the decision was made to help bring them back. Genetic testing showed the frogs that used to live in Southern California most closely resembled remnant populations in Mexico.

""So in thinking about reintroducing frogs and bringing them back and restoring these ecosystems, it became clear we needed a Mexican source for the frogs,"" says Fisher.

In Mexico, Peralta-Garcia and her nonprofit Fauna del Noroeste set to work preserving the Baja Peninsula's last-remaining populations of red-legged frogs, restoring habitat and boosting their populations with the support of the U.S.-based groups.

Meanwhile, in Southern California, two sites with multiple water bodies were identified as suitable habitats in San Diego and Riverside counties. They were cleared of invasive, predatory bullfrogs.

In 2020, after a tangle of paperwork and permits, the first translocation took place.

""It was like planes, trains and automobiles,"" Fisher says. ""It was just a lot of different moving parts.""

An egg mass was moved by helicopter and car, down dirt roads and over the U.S. border to one of the prepared sites in Southern California. Others followed. The wait began.

Tasking AI to listen for frogs

The goal of a translocation, or assisted migration, is to either move a species back to a place it's been extirpated from, or to a more suitable habitat. The latter is becoming more relevant as the climate warms and ecosystems change.

For a relocation to be successful, the moved species needs to be able to survive on its own in its new environment. It needs to be self-sustaining. And to self-sustain, the frogs needed to be breeding.

toggle caption Brad Nissen/USFWS

The easiest way to know if frogs are breeding is by listening for their calls, says Hardy. ""When frogs are calling, most of the time, that's the male of the species using those calls as an advertisement.""

But trying to listen out for occasional nocturnal mating calls is tedious work. ""I'd love to be out there every night at these ponds, with my tent and camping and trying to listen for them, but it's just not feasible,"" he says.

So instead Hardy and the team set up a series of microphones around the relocation sites.

The microphones recorded audio from dusk to dawn, day after day, week after week, collecting thousands of hours of audio during the frog's winter mating season.

But that led to a new problem. Hardy says they'd need an army of ears ""to be able to sort through all these files and find where the frogs are.""

To help reduce the time and effort, the team partnered with outside engineers to create a custom machine learning model – similar to the popular birding app Merlin – trained to sort through the data and detect the calls of two species: the California red-legged frog and their competitor, the non-native American Bullfrog.

toggle caption Bradford Hollingsworth/San Diego Natural History Museum

It wasn't perfect at first. Hardy says that early on, the model flagged a call that it thought was a frog but was in fact a hooded merganser, a bird that's also known as the frog duck because its mating calls sound so similar to a frog's. But with time, they've been able to refine the model and are now working on a real-time alert system that will let biologists know instantaneously when a Bullfrog or red-legged frog is detected.

For Clark Winchell, a long-time muddy boot biologist with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the technology has been revelatory.

""I spent countless hours by myself in a kayak listening for bullfrogs. It's not the most efficient use of time,"" he says. ""What they've done with AI on this project is incredible. It's systematic monitoring of two species.""

Using the model, earlier this winter, they were able to identify the grunts of a California red-legged frog. Soon after, a survey found a new gelatinous ball of fresh eggs near the microphone that recorded it.

North, who'd helped spearhead the effort for more than a decade, says it brought tears to her eyes. There's still work to do, she says. There's still a lot of gaps in the species' historic range.

But in some parts of Southern California, for the first time in decades, she says, ""We're hearing them again.""",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,

Shaun Tullier Shaun Tullier Shaun Tullier said he started digging under his house after being tipped off about a German bunker being underneath The digging eventually unearthed the entrance to a German bunker

A couple says they have been left gobsmacked after they dug under their house and discovered a Nazi bunker under it. Shaun and Carrie Tullier bought their home in the Torteval area of Guernsey four years ago and knew it had been the site of a World War Two German gun emplacement. However, after being tipped off by someone who used to live in the house about a bunker possibly being underneath it, the couple decided to dig up the driveway and eventually managed to unearth the wartime building. The couple said they had plans to turn the bunker into a games room and gym, but were also keen to make sure historic elements remained in place.

Germany forces occupied the Channel Islands from 1940 until 1945 and, under Adolf Hitler's orders, turned the the islands into an ""impregnable fortress"". During the occupation, hundreds of islanders were deported to prisons in Europe and many who remained on the islands nearly starved. The occupation lasted until 9 May 1945, when Guernsey and Jersey were liberated. Sark was liberated a day later, while Alderney, where most of the islanders had been forced to leave their homes, could not return until 15 December 1945. Islanders now celebrate the end of the Nazi occupation with Liberation Day events in Guernsey, Jersey and Sark, along with Homecoming Day in Alderney.

Shaun Tullier Shaun Tullier said he was impressed with how well built the bunker was

Mr Tullier said he and his wife had been told about the site being used as a German gun emplacement, but they had a suspicion there was something else there. ""From the outside, you could tell it was sitting on top of something,"" he said. Mr Tullier added that it was when a previous occupant of the house told them in March 2022 a bunker might be underneath it, he decided it was time to investigate. ""We've been doing up the house anyway, so I hired a digger and, with the help of a mate, we started digging up the driveway to see what was there,"" he said. ""We kept digging down for a while and then finally, the ground just gave way and this doorway appeared.""

Shaun Tullier Work to renovate the bunker is ongoing

It is believed the bunker's entrance was blocked up in the 1960s and Mr Tullier said he was impressed with how well built the structure was. The bunker consisted of two main rooms measuring 17ft by 10ft (5.18m by 3m) and 17ft by 20ft (5.18, by 6m), with features including a tiled floor, escape hatch and German writing on the walls. Among the messages on the walls include ""achtung feind hort mit"" - which translates to ""beware, the enemy is listening"". The couple also found dozens of tins and other debris which had been left behind inside the bunker.

Shaun Tullier Several German phrases are written on the walls in the bunker

Mr Tullier said one of the main issues which needed sorting out after the bunker was found was pumping water out after it had gathered inside over the decades, but the structure was generally fairly sound. He added converting the bunker into a games room - with a snooker table - and gym remained a work in progress. Mr Tullier said the discovery of the bunker had piqued the interest of other people and he felt it was important to keep the German elements present. He said: ""It's not just a games room - people come along and ask to see the history. ""You hear a lot of people say they would just blow up these bunkers, but we feel very privileged to have it. ""I know it was a bad time for Guernsey [during the Nazi occupation], but I do find the history fascinating and I think we need to keep it so we remember what happened.""",NewsData.io,-1.35,,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,bbc.com,,bbc,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,

GB News presenter Anne Diamond was forced to apologise after the programme suffered a glaring technical blunder. The pair were speaking about the government's new plans to introduce a jail term to anyone who is caught promoting migrant crossings. The hosts began reading out comments from viewers who shared their thoughts on the new order, with one saying: ""The moment anybody gets five years for selling illegal documents to immigrants, I will eat my hat."" Anne, 70, who hosted alongside Stephen Dixon on Sunday, joked that they would be on standby for this before the screen cut to black. While the ticker continued running at the bottom of the screen, the presenters were nowhere to be seen. A highlights reel began playing, including a clip of Cameron Walker speaking about Queen Elizabeth's memorial at St James' Park back in June. This was followed by Eamonn Holmes and Ellie Costello's interview with British expat David Mason, who was left severely injured after a missile landed around 25ft away from him in Haifa, Israel in June.

Footage from previous GB News shows continued playing for around 13 minutes before Stephen and Anne finally returned. Anne confessed they had no idea what caused the technical issue but confirmed they ""fell off air"". Stephen, 51, added: ""It's technology which has just gone slightly potty."" Anne chimed in: ""I don't think, as many people have been saying, it's a political conspiracy but we'll keep an eye on that just in case."" The presenters had no problem amusing themselves during the spout of technical issues, with Anne revealing Stephen and Aman Bhogal had been discussing a number of different topics.

GB News fell off air for several minutes

""You ought to hear what they've been talking about - mobile phones and the very latest technologies, whether if something folds twice is enough or whether something folds three times,"" she quipped. Noting that they mostly discuss politics during the show, Stephen admitted he enjoyed getting to know his co-star on another level. ""It's been really interesting to get to know you on a different plane of existence,"" Stephen said. ""I like you all the more."" Anne apologised to viewers for the technical blunder, declaring: ""If you have been kicking your television and wondering what the heck is going on, we do apologise. For some reason we fell off air and we don't know why.""

Cooper condemned the 'brazen tactics' employed by smuggling gangs online, describing them as exploiting vulnerable migrants with false promises. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's government is focused on enhancing border security and disrupting these criminal networks.

Despite the efforts to curb crossings, numbers have surged, with over 25,000 migrants arriving by boat this year.

Snoop Dogg is the latest and perhaps most unlikely investor in Welsh football at Swansea City

From Wrexham to Swansea and, perhaps soon, Cardiff: is the need for narratives leading the rich and famous to Welsh football?

Two years ago, an American couple at Crewe train station asked me if they were on the right platform. They’d travelled from the other side of the world to go on a football pilgrimage.

Crewe is a short hop to the stadium tours and superstores of Liverpool and Manchester’s Premier League clubs. But they were on the right platform for their destination: Wrexham.

This isn’t another take on the relentless Hollywood promotion machine which is Wrexham AFC. More than enough has been written.

What they’ve achieved has been brilliantly executed by all concerned having done their research – identifying a club in a working-class football hotbed with a fanatical fanbase and a rich history; people, place and past combining with superstar glamour to create a narrative to capture the imagination.

Four seasons, three promotions and 49 episodes later it appears that the beautiful game’s combination of cash and need for narrative is now turning its attention to the rest of Wales and the other Cymru members of the English Football League.

Yes, the EFL 92 features four Welsh clubs, and this historical anomaly may be about to pay dividends for the clubs across (cliché alert) Offa’s Dyke.

There will always be one fan in the away end of every visiting English club brandishing an inflatable sheep, but no one will care if the Cymru clubs are in financial football fashion.

Wrexham, Swansea, Cardiff… Newport?

Having seen what’s happened with Wrexham, Swansea City said, ‘hold my beer’. First, serial Champions League winner Luka Modric became a “co-owner” of the club, which was naturally followed by rapper Snoop Dogg joining the board.

Modric refused to mix business with pleasure by signing for AC Milan, but Snoop immediately got down to it with a kit reveal and a mural promoting an ice cream brand.

I’m unsure of Snoop’s past allegiance to “Swansea City Soccer Club [sic]”. Maybe he used to watch them over at Catherine Zeta Jones’s house.

Read more Snoop Dogg joins Luka Modric as co-owner of Swansea City

Although it’s more likely that a combination of Swansea’s sponsors, the smarts of CEO Tom Gorringe and the Wrexham effect have combined to offer Snoop (and Modric) a soccer storyline to be part of.

With the two having a combined Instagram reach of 125m, a lot of people are now watching.

Football offers some financial certainties thanks to seasonal TV money, but absolutely none on the pitch where very few ever win silverware. A 46-game season can culminate in finishing 12th, so narratives are increasingly as important in capturing fans and commercial opportunities.

Down the M4 and another story is playing out at Cardiff City, where local boy, serial Champions League winner and national hero Gareth Bale is leading a consortium attempting to buy the recently relegated Bluebirds — presenting the prospect of Bale v Modric in the directors’ box in 2026-27. Millions of Madristas around the world would be intrigued by that.

Talking of Spanish giants, the fourth Welsh league club, Newport County got in on the unlikely storytelling act last week.

A kit launch, in partnership with Athletic Bilbao – centred on the city sheltering child refugees during the Spanish Civil War – was beautifully done, put the club on an international platform and sold as many shirts internationally as in Newport.

Club owner Huw Jenkins clearly has an eye on the bigger picture as well, having previously taken Swansea City from financial peril to the Premier League.

Less than two miles away from this once grand looking building is The Malt Shovel pub on Anlaby Road, where Paul Renton is sipping his pint outside on the terrace under the midday sun.

""I'm scared for my grand kids,"" he said.

""I don't blame the people for doing stuff like that. It's getting worse and worse now. It's all about the illegals.""

Mr Renton was on a trip to Bridlington when missiles were thrown at the hotel and the adjacent train station, which was forced to shut with workers barricading themselves in to prevent rioters surging onto the concourse and platforms.

""All the trains got cancelled and it cost us a lot of money to get back,"" said the grandfather.

While Mr Renton does not condone the violence, he believes ""British people have had enough"" of those arriving on smalls boats from France and being housed in hotels.

It is one of the most divisive issues in the UK.

More than 25,000 migrants have crossed the English Channel since the start of the year, according to the Home Office.

It is the first time the 25,000 threshold has been reached since records began in 2018.

The numbers of asylum seekers in UK hotels had been increasing since 2020, and reached a peak of more than 50,000 in 2023. In March 2025, the asylum hotel population stood at 32,345.

Ministers previously said the government wanted to end the use of hotels by 2029 and was trying to move people into cheaper types of accommodation.

Mr Renton is not alone in his views, the same are echoed by other pubgoers.

George Ketley watched disturbing scenes of the hostility and rage unfold in his home city via TV.

Like Mr Renton he condemns the violence, but said at its core was the issue of asylum accommodation.

653,227,Puma’s new boss takes helm trailing Adidas and a recovering Nike,https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/pumas-new-boss-takes-helm-trailing-adidas-and-a-recovering-nike/article69889482.ece,03/08/2025 06:34,thehindubusinessline,,channel crossings,"For more than two years, Puma SE’s top brass spoke of “elevating” the German brand and making its sneakers and apparel more aspirational. Since arriving last month, Chief Executive Officer Arthur Hoeld has delivered a fairly blunt verdict: Puma, if anything, is now perceived as cheap.

Hoeld, a decades-long veteran of cross-town rival Adidas AG, has the task of turning Puma around and charting a return to profit and growth. It’s not the first time the 77-year-old brand has needed a makeover, and former bosses like Jochen Zeitz, now head of Harley-Davidson Inc., and Bjorn Gulden, who became CEO of Adidas in 2023, both found ways to revitalize Puma’s leaping cat.

But Hoeld has significant hurdles to clear. Fast-growing brands like On Holding AG, New Balance and Hoka are winning customers and taking more shelf space at retailers. Adidas is still riding high on its retro Sambas, while industry leader Nike Inc. is bouncing back under company veteran Elliott Hill with products like the Vomero 18 running shoe, after a rare rough patch for the Swoosh.

Then there are challenges Puma can do little to control: a fast-appreciating euro and US President Donald Trump’s trade tariffs ramping up industry costs. Hoeld took the first step toward what looks like a textbook reset on July 24, delivering a brutal financial reappraisal that sees a 20% plunge in sales in the coming months and Puma losing money this year.

“That tells you that something is really quite wrong,” said Piral Dadhania, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “This is a fairly high-risk sort of turnaround. The execution becomes much more relevant in that situation.”

Hoeld first has to stop the bleeding. He is inheriting a growing pile of unsold sneakers and apparel in warehouses around the world that could take Puma more than a year to work through and to convince retailers to buy from the brand again, Deutsche Bank analyst Adam Cochrane said in a note.

“It’s pretty toxic,” said Ingo Speich, a portfolio manager with Deka Investment in Frankfurt, a major Puma shareholder. “If you produce more and more shoes and widen your product range — at the same time as you get less retail space because other brands are far stronger — then it gets difficult.”

After Puma’s profit warning, Hoeld linked the inventory challenge to big-picture questions that could take months to answer and even longer to execute on. “Do we have the right products for our consumers and our wholesale partners?” he asked. “If so, why is our brand not achieving the required visibility and engagement?” He promised to unveil his strategy in late October.

The slump is badly timed. The sneaker world has transformed in the past decade as Adidas and Nike pulled back from many retail partners, prioritizing direct-to-consumer sales channels in hopes of boosting profits. That approach backfired, with consumers embracing smaller brands like On, Hoka and New Balance that secured their products more space on retailers’ shelves.

Puma, though, failed to capitalize on Nike’s stumbles, while Adidas quickly reversed course under Gulden, winning back retailers who couldn’t get enough of the three-striped Sambas and similar models. Since Hill returned to Nike last fall, he’s been repairing relationships with retail partners including Amazon.com Inc., and the company appears set for a new era of growth.

Underdog

For decades, Puma has occupied a tricky spot in the sporting goods world. Though it competes in everything from football and basketball to running, it’s much smaller than its main rivals Adidas and Nike in that multi-sport game. Its products typically command lower prices, though it’s had success when it carves out a niche, often as the underdog brand.

When Gulden arrived at Puma in 2013, he refocused the company on performance sports and leaned heavily on the brand’s one genuine superstar: sprinter Usain Bolt. The Jamaican inspired the slogan “Forever Faster” and featured on a TV ad frolicking with women in a hot tub. “Calling all troublemakers,” he said. “For danger, risk and potential fugitive status.”

Fast-forward just over a decade and there was little of that rebellious spirit in Puma’s “Go Wild” ad this spring, which was aimed at everyday runners looking for feel-good vibes. The campaign struggled to stand out against Adidas’s no-stress “You Got This” push, or On’s video featuring Sesame Street’s Elmo urging runners clad in the brand’s plushly cushioned trainers to not be so hard on themselves — because “soft wins.”

Yet it’s Puma’s Speedcat sneaker that typifies the brand’s turmoil. In 2023, Puma was slow to bring back its retro Palermo trainer to compete with Adidas’s Samba. At the time, Puma leaders said they would punch back by owning the likely follow-up trend for thin-soled, “low-profile” sneakers.

Their hopes were pinned on the ’90s-era Speedcat — originally a product of Zeitz’s push to get Puma into motorsports — becoming a blockbuster. Celebrities including Jennifer Lawrence began to wear them in 2024 and Puma finally scaled up production earlier this year, with ex-CEO Arne Freundt saying it could be one of the hottest shoes of the summer.

Disappointment

Puma now acknowledges the shoe simply hasn’t caught on.

Adding insult to injury, Adidas swooped in with its similar Taekwondo franchise to capture post-Samba demand, and it’s now outperforming Puma’s Speedcat models on StockX, according to the resale platform.

The Speedcat was key to Puma’s strategy to elevate the brand and help it command higher prices for other products. Instead, some versions of the €110 ($127) sneaker can be purchased for as low as €88 on its website. Versions of the €100 Palermo are discounted as much as 30%. Adidas sells some versions of its Samba for nearly twice as much.

Speich hopes Hoeld’s decades of sales experience at Adidas will help. He spent years overseeing its retro footwear and apparel business, and led the Europe, Middle East and Africa division. He was head of global sales until October.

If Puma can produce some hot new products, Hoeld may do a better job of getting them into the right stores in front of the right customers, according to Speich. It’s not a matter of turning the brand “upscale,” he added.

Hoeld singled out the running franchise as having immediate potential. In 2021, Puma reentered the sport with its “Nitro” foam shoes, winning praise from hardcore runners and professionals. But it was slow to target more casual buyers, and Puma is currently only available in 20 of running-chain Fleet Feet’s nearly 300 locations in the US, for instance.

“When we talk innovation in our industry, running is one of these sports that matters,” Hoeld told reporters. “We are going to make sure that Nitro is going to be seen globally as a key platform for future success of Puma.”

657,99,"India-UK FTA Sets Stage For Next-Gen Trade Ties, But What’s In It For Startups?",https://inc42.com/features/india-uk-fta-trade-deal-what-for-startups/,03/08/2025 06:11,inc42,GB,channel crossings,"While experts warn that the FTA may not have an immediate impact, its broader scope covering services, R&D and cleantech collaboration sets the stage for sustained growth and innovation-led exports in the years to come

Sectors such as apparel, footwear, food, cosmetics, auto components, and EV tech stand to benefit from reduced tariffs and regulatory support

The India-UK FTA offers a much-needed diplomatic and economic boost at a time when India’s ties with the US are under pressure

As India navigates through the roiling waters of geopolitics, its free trade agreement (FTA) with the UK has come as a much-needed respite.

The FTA with the UK, signed last month, attains higher significance for India, with the US slapping it with a 25% reciprocal tariff, along with a penalty, for running trade with Russia, which is at war with Ukraine.

At a time when the US-India relations are experiencing significant strain after two decades of closeness, what does the India-UK trade deal bring to the table? How are different sectors and the Indian economy as a whole expected to benefit from it?

Let’s dive deeper into these questions and many more, as we explore the full extent of this move.

The UK has officially said that this agreement with India is its biggest and most economically significant bilateral FTA since Brexit. India, whose bilateral trade with the UK reached $56 Bn in 2024, aims to double this number by 2030.

However, Barclays has reportedly flagged that the move is “unlikely to alter the current account balance for India meaningfully”, as the UK is India’s seventh-largest trading partner, accounting for 3.5% of its total merchandise exports.

While the short-term gains may not be obvious to everyone, experts believe the deal is slated to bring long-term benefits for both nations.

Also, at a time when India is aiming to expand its exports but faces hurdles in the US, which is its top export market, contributing almost 18% to its merchandise exports, the deal with the UK is indeed a major win at a diplomatic level.

“A major supply chain rebalancing is happening throughout the globe, and the FTA will become a catalyst to that,” said Amit Baid, head of tax at law firm BTG Advaya, which advises global corporates on cross-border M&As, tax litigations, compliances, and more.

Baid said that the UK wants to diversify its sourcing options, and India fits into the equation perfectly, as the US tariff hike could dampen Indian exports. This is where the UK deal ensures a win-win for all.

“The FTA may help us fill the export gap by supplying to the US indirectly via the UK,” Baid added.

The expert is of the view that the pact, once in effect, is expected to be a game-changer for India’s export market and pave the way for future bilateral trade agreements.

But, What’s The UK-India Pact All About?

The Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) gives duty-free access to 99% of Indian exports to the UK.

For instance, export duties on leather and footwear are expected to drop from 16% to zero. Similarly, tariffs on textiles and clothing may be annulled from 12%. Auto parts, which earlier faced up to 18% duty, will also enjoy free access.

India, in turn, has also agreed to slash import duty on British goods to 3% from 15% earlier, excluding dairy and agricultural products.

The UK-India pact covers not just goods but also services. This has the potential to create job opportunities for Indians in the UK and enable knowledge sharing.

Sectors, ranging from auto and electric vehicles to consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, stand to benefit from this pact in the near to long term. However, apparel, textiles, footwear, and cosmetics could be the early winners.

The UK imported around £1.4 Bn (over $1.8 Bn) of textiles, clothing and footwear from India in 2024, accounting for 14.1% of the UK’s total imports of goods from India.

“The UK imports from India in the textiles, apparel and leather sectors are expected to rise by approximately £2.9 Bn, equivalent to an 85% relative to a baseline of no FTA. This growth in imports is driven by clothing, textiles and footwear, whose imports are estimated to increase by £475 Mn (45%), £175 Mn (40%) and £55 Mn (30%), respectively,” the agreement reads.

So, does this mean that the move could create exciting opportunities for Indian textile suppliers and retail brands to grow in the UK market? If yes, India’s thriving D2C sector is particularly well-positioned to benefit.

Sunrise Moment For Indian D2C Brands?

For Indian D2C brands, it has not been easy to expand geographies. Even though this market has made significant strides, with the fashion apparel and accessories leading the ecommerce race in the country, most new-age brands face challenges in global expansion due to the high cost associated with compliance, setting up direct distribution channels and higher export duties.

“Bangladesh has an edge due to lower labour costs and existing FTAs with western countries. The deal finally narrows that gap for India, especially in value-added products like apparel, footwear, and accessories, where India scores higher in design and speed-to-market,” said Siddharth Dungarwal, the founder of Snitch.

As per Dungarwal, although the UK is a saturated fashion market, there’s a huge gap in affordable premium and trend-led fashion, and “Indian brands have a real advantage because of speed in design-to-market cycles and efficient supply chains”. Plus, the diaspora in the UK gives Indian brands a ready customer base.

He believes that the FTA levels the playing field for Indian D2C brands, as now they would be able to cater to a market where consumers value speed, quality, and brand-led storytelling as much as cost.

For the Snitch founder, too, the trade deal is an attractive proposition to expand in the UK.

“When duties come down, the landed cost of products drops significantly, which means Indian brands can price competitively in the UK while still maintaining healthy margins. Earlier, high tariffs made it tough to set up our own online stores or retail partnerships because pricing after duties would often match or exceed local alternatives,” he said.

However, it is not only the clothing and apparel market that is brimming with hope for international expansion following the trade deal. Food and cosmetics brands would also get a boost in the long run.

Naveen Malpani, partner and consumer and retail industry leader at Grant Thornton Bharat, said lower tariffs will support the growth of processed foods, herbal personal care and wellness products that appeal to British consumers. This will be especially beneficial for MSMEs focussed on value-added and natural offerings.

Meanwhile, Anurag Mehrotra, chairperson at cosmetics brand Fixderma, said that while online will continue to be a core driver after the FTA, he expects the deal to open doors to offline retail, clinical partnerships, and pharmacy chains in the UK.

“The real shift will be in moving from digital-only to a hybrid omnichannel export strategy,” he said.

It’s worth noting, however, that British cosmetics also have a large export opportunity in India. With reduced tariffs, the UK’s exports of cosmetics to India are estimated to increase by 360%. Therefore, Indian D2C brands would need to address other non-tariff challenges to ensure Indian exports outgrow imports.

Tariffs Drop, But Is That It?

As cross-border sales increase, the UK compliance requirement will also tighten. Therefore, D2C brands will need to strive for perfection in the areas of packaging, labelling and safety standards, particularly in cosmetics, food, and wellness, to reap the benefits of the FTA, experts said.

Kannan Sitaram, partner and cofounder of Fireside Ventures and investor in several D2C brands, including Mamaearth, Traya and Kapiva, said that the Indian brands need to rediscover the product-market fit when entering the western markets.

“The organoleptics of food products, preferences in perfumes and cosmetics, and design aesthetics in packaging are very culture-dependent and can vary hugely between India and countries such as the UK. Brands should understand consumers in their cultural context to increase their chances of success when they move into new markets,” he said.

Moving on, while consumer goods stand at the forefront of witnessing a new dawn, with increased volume and growth in exports, the Indian manufacturing sector, including automotive and cleantech segments, has refused to be left behind.

In FY24, India exported auto parts worth about $191.6 Mn to the UK, while imports stood at around $138.6 Mn.

“With tariffs on components set to be significantly reduced, Indian manufacturers, particularly those supplying to global OEMs, are well-positioned to expand their footprint in the UK market,” said Saket Mehra, partner, Grant Thornton Bharat.

He added that the UK-India deal strengthens India’s role in the global automotive ecosystem, as it is also focussed on enhancing market access, encouraging technology collaboration and fostering synergies across the supply chain.

Meanwhile, the UK is looking at increasing its export of luxury cars to India. However, this will be a two-way street, as Indian OEMs will now be able to supply parts to British automotive companies at a low cost.

BTG Advaya’s Baid said that EV components, two wheelers, parts of motors, batteries, and chargers will have easier access to the UK market with the tariff elimination. Besides, the trade agreement may also boost contract manufacturing and assembly of auto parts in the country.

Beyond this, the deal opens doors for R&D in battery innovation, hydrogen, light EV technology, as well as clean and climate tech innovations.

However, the Indian economy may not witness a sudden boost, especially when the US is playing a spoilsport, discrediting the relationship that took years to be forged between the two global powerhouses.

All in all, the UK-India agreement is one of India’s most comprehensive deals with a western economy, as it aligns strongly with its digital ambitions and opens new doors for startups and innovation-led growth. While global headwinds may delay immediate gains, the long-term potential is undeniable. Still, the question remains — how long will it take before we get to see the green shoots finally emerge?

In Essex we are blessed with many incredible parks to visit, especially during the school holidays. This country park is a hub filled with fun, adventure and beauty - and perfect for the summer. Gunpowder Park is beautifully landscaped and ideal for walks, picnics and families looking to spend time in the great outdoors.

The site in Waltham Abbey has an interesting back story. It used to be a munitions testing range owned by the MOD before being transformed into a country park in 2004.

The large country park is situated on the Greater London and Essex borders, Gunpowder Park and Sewardstone Marsh offer scenic walks and cycling trails through 220 acres of grassland, wildflower meadows and wet woodland.

According to Visit Lee Valley: ""Gunpowder Park and Sewardstone Marsh are an ideal place for walkers and cyclists, with a comprehensive network of surfaced paths accessible in all weathers. There is also a permissive bridleway for summer use circling the arable farm fields that border the parks.""

And after all that exercise, there's a choice of The Plough and The Bakers Arms. Both pubs are across the road and are welcoming places to go for food and drink.

Gunpowder Park highlights:

By the main entrance, the large area of grassland in front of the building is maintained for games and picnicking

Bird hides near Osier Marsh look out over two seasonal pools. Osier and other willow species thrive in this wet environment

The Greenwich Meridian Line runs through the land. Here, there is a viewpoint on a hill overlooking the park and parts of Epping Forest

Knights Pits and Sewardstone Marsh have grass paths that wind through old gravel pits and wet woodland. And a former fishing lake near there has been left undisturbed for wildlife to flourish

Visit Lee Valley tells visitors why the park is good to visit during the summer months: ""The wildflower meadows are in bloom and rich in colour. Common Knapweed, buttercup and Rosebay Willowherb are common around site. Pyramidal and Bee Orchids can be found on the on the slopes of the mounded areas in the middle of the park.

Think 'President of an unrecognised state' and the image of a mild-mannered 20-year-old video game developer in Dover does not immediately spring to mind.

But when he's not sitting at home creating virtual worlds on Roblox to pay the rent, Daniel Jackson is busy running his ""government in exile"".

His adventures have even seen him detained in the Balkans before eventually being deported back to Britain.

""I think I've scared my parents half to death a lot of the time. I don't doubt that because obviously you have to be completely nuts to try and do what we're doing,"" he tells me in the Market Square Kitchen in Dover town centre.

In 2019, he and a group of friends found out that the Serbia-Croatia border dispute had left some small patches of land on the banks of the Danube River unclaimed by either country.

On May 30 of that year, they declared one of those pockets the 'Free Republic of Verdis', with the then 15-year-old Mr Jackson as its inaugural president.

Nothing much seemed to happen with his fledgling micronation until October 12, 2023, when he and others attempted to ""settle"" the land. ""We were going to put some houseboats along the river,"" he says.

(Image: Daniel Jackson/Verdis)

""We had some prefabricated materials being produced in Serbia that we were going to get brought down on a barge from Apertin. The settlement only lasted a few days before Croatian authorities came in, and they were quite aggressive with us as well.""

Mr Jackson was deported, as were several of his colleagues. He was banned from Croatia for good, and several of his fellow 'Verdisians' got three-month bans. The official status we had was 'threat to homeland security'. At the time I was 18 and I found that quite funny.""

He and his ""government in exile"" claim that Croatia is violating international law by refusing them the chance to live on the patch of land, which is about the size of the Vatican.

Thanks to post-Yugoslav War border drawing, there are numerous pockets of empty land in the area, which neither Croatia nor Serbia say belong to them.

Mr Jackson and his 'cabinet' say that makes the land ""terra nullius"" under international law – open season for anyone who wants to proclaim the creation of a country there.

""There is no other entity that has previously claimed this land in over 20 years,"" he says. ""We are the oldest active claimants; even if someone else did turn up there, we would still maintain that we are the legal authorities to be there.""

Perhaps unsurprisingly, there does not seem to have been any rush from other countries or organisations like the UN to back Verdis.

He frequently travels from Dover to the Serbian capital, Belgrade, trying to establish relationships with politicians and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) there.

""We've never had a problem with Serbia whatsoever,"" he says – and adds that he has spoken to politicians of the ruling party.

Their most recent trip was only days before we met in Dover.

""We visited Verdis from Apertin, or at least, you know, hovered around the waters,"" he says.

""We didn't try to land, but were chased off by Croatian authorities. We don't believe they had the right to do that because they shouldn't be entering. Well, they can go through our waters because it's an international waterway, but they shouldn't have the right to chase us off or anything.""

He and his government have Verdisian passports and ID cards – written in the three official languages: Serbian, Croatian and English. Mr Jackson himself speaks only a bit of Serbian and Croatian. He claims he knows at least one person who managed to leave Greece on their Greek passport, and then successfully enter North Macedonia using their Verdisian ID.

However, he stresses that daring citizens who try to travel on their Verdis documentation do so ""at their own risk"".

The Principality of Sealand, an unrecognised microstate on a platform off East Anglia, famously sells noble titles and citizenship on its website. Verdis is much more selective.

""We've had 15,000 applications for citizenship, but we've only accepted 400,"" Mr Jackson says. ""We're only slightly larger in the Vatican. There are a lot of in-demand skills, so we have to be very careful with what people are allowed.""

(Image: Local Democracy Reporting Service)

Despite currently not being able to set foot on it, they have big plans for Verdis.

""The main goal there is to get a lot of temporary infrastructure down and to try to start building permanent infrastructure within the first few months,"" the provisional president says.

""It obviously costs a lot in funding and so on – we do have some people that would be willing to help us.""

Being so small, he envisions the country as having a digitally-focused economy. They plan to use the Euro without agreement with the EU or Eurozone, much like Montenegro and Kosovo.

The project is not all talk, however. Mr Jackson and some of his newer countrymen met in an online Stand With Ukraine community, founded after the Russian invasion of that country in 2022. Several of them have teamed up in getting humanitarian aid to Ukraine: sending radios to Kyiv and helping deliver relief from Poland.

There is precedent for proclaiming new countries in unclaimed land – though none have been successful. A huge unpopulated area called Bir Tawil sits between Egypt and Sudan, unclaimed by either, and numerous people have declared competing states there.

Just up the river from Verdis is Liberland, founded by a Libertarian Czech politician in 2015, and using the very same border ambiguity to find terra nullius. Much like Verdis, it has no permanent population, and attempts to access it have resulted in prospective settlers being arrested.

Kent-based associate professor of International Relations at UCL, Dr Philip Cunliffe, says the proclamation of Verdis has ""no basis in modern international law"".

""Given the long and complicated history of European state formation, stranger things have happened,"" Dr Cunliffe said.

""He could do little worse in the region, given how the peoples of the region tore themselves apart only to try and rejoin the borderless EU as independent states.""

However, the professor does think that the authorities have gone too far in banning Mr Jackson, adding: ""It sounds like Croatia is taking a heavy hand with a harmless crank.""

Mr Jackson was born in Australia, but his parents and sister were all born in Britain. His mother is from Dover itself, as were her parents. He says his family have always been ""pretty supportive"" of the Verdis project.

""Every parent worries and obviously my parents worried when I got detained by Croatian authorities,"" he says.

""I wasn't really worried; we sort of predicted that something like this could happen.

""I think my family, over the years, have seen I'm a bit unpredictable at times, when it comes to crazy decisions that probably a normal 20-year-old doesn't make, and I think they've got used to that now. It's unusual but the world would be boring without unusual.""

When he isn't spending time on Verdisian activities, Mr Jackson is a self-employed video game designer, using Roblox as a platform to create other games – which he says pays his rent.

He confidently refers to his 'government in exile', his vice-President and ministers, and speaks fluently in the register of banished leaders and pretenders to defunct thrones. Somehow, it does not quite have the gravity of Charles de Gaulle in London in 1941.

Mr Jackson thinks his new nation's success is ""a when, not an if"", arguing that one day Serbia and Croatia will sort out their border dispute, and leave Verdis to it.

Verdis will almost certainly never be recognised by any other government. It is unlikely to ever have a permanent population, and the 'Provisional Government' will likely never exert any authority beyond the administration of their social media accounts.

Far from the 'Verdisians' representing some powerful new nationalism, their endeavour says more about the decay of nation-statehood everywhere else in the world.

A state has a definite territory and population, and is the supreme authority over that place and people, recognising equals but no superior. Verdis may claim the first two, whatever others may think, but in practice it has no authority.

But how many real governments can credibly claim this for themselves? They willingly cede their political authority to supranational organisations, regulators, the civil service and the judiciary. They even claim responsibility for potentially endless numbers of people outside their own borders through humanitarian obligations.

With the content of nation-statehood so diluted, is it any surprise there are some who now feel these things can be willed into existence by finding a blank space on a map?

Leaders of prospective new countries have a habit of staying in power for a long time after things get up and running. But the 20-year-old president has no desire to carry on for much longer if Verdis is established and has elections.

""I'm exhausted. I just want to be a normal citizen,"" he adds.

BACK HOME. Ea Tulin-Escuete works in her laboratory at the Advanced Research and Innovation Center located in Leyte.

Her research at Harvard has potential applications in cancer diagnostics, neuroscience, and infectious diseases. This only reinforced her resolve to come back home.

LEYTE, Philippines – Dr. Ea Kristine Clarisse B. Tulin-Escueta, an assistant professor at the Visayas State University (VSU), has returned home with a renewed vision for the future of science in the Eastern Visayas region.

Fresh from her postdoctoral fellowship at Harvard Medical School’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Ea is determined to champion biotechnology research in her home university in Leyte.

A proud product of a state university, she earned her college chemistry degree at VSU, graduating magna cum laude and serving as class valedictorian in 2016.

Ea later pursued her graduate education at the Tokyo University of Agriculture and Technology, where she earned both her master’s and doctoral degrees in biological chemistry. She was mentored in Japan by professor Atsushi Nishikawa, an internationally renowned glycobiologist and immunologist, who greatly influenced her scientific foundations in glycosciences.

Even before going to Harvard, Ea made the intentional choice to return to VSU after finishing her PhD, joining the newly established Department of Biotechnology, an emerging field of discipline that is only offered by few institutions in the country.

But, in 2023, a rare opportunity opened for her. She was accepted for a competitive postdoctoral fellowship in the United States under the mentorship of professor Richard D. Cummings, a leading authority in the global field of glycobiology and glycomics.

At Harvard, she honed advanced techniques in developing lab-made antibody that targets specific sugars on harmful cells to help the body fight diseases. This has potential applications in cancer diagnostics, neuroscience, and infectious diseases.

Her experience abroad only reinforced her resolve to come back home.

“I’ve always actually dreamed of working in the Philippines. I thought, when I was young, if I can find a way to combine this beautiful island of Leyte with the science that I’m trained to do abroad, that would be the best-case scenario,” she said.

She refers to her dream of building a “science island” in Leyte: a vision where government, industry, and academia collaborate to produce impactful, community-responsive research.

“The Philippines needs more scientists. VSU, I’ve always thought of it as my home. I want to build some sort of science island here, where we can do impactful research for the community to really address the needs of our people in Leyte,” she said.

INFLUENCE. Ea together with her parents, professors Edgardo and Anabella, during their visit in Harvard. Derek Alviola

She hopes to establish a research laboratory focusing on glycobiology and natural products for metabolic diseases, which are areas pioneered by her mentors, former VSU president Dr. Edgardo E. Tulin and outgoing Advanced Research and Innovation Center (ARIC) director Dr. Maria Teresa P. Loreto.

Ea plans to integrate her expertise in immunology and glycosciences to tackle pressing local health issues such as snake bites, rabies, and schistosomiasis.

She also believes that returning scientists like herself carry a broader responsibility.

“As international scholars, our role is to build bridges between the Philippines and the world. We are ambassadors of Filipino scientists. We put our best foot forward so we can open opportunities for others,” Ea said.

Her commitment to this ideal has already borne fruit. After her time in Japan, she helped create pathways for four VSU alumni to pursue masters and doctoral degrees because of her recommendations. The same is now happening at Harvard, where another Filipino scholar has succeeded her in the same antibody development work she practiced.

GIVING BACK. Ea mentors colleagues at Leyte’s Advanced Research and Innovation Center. Derek Alviola

Now firmly back at VSU, Ea is focused on cultivating a dynamic research ecosystem in Eastern Visayas. She hopes to inspire and mentor the next generation of Filipino scientists while forging strategic partnerships across disciplines and borders.

In fact, she will bring her mentor Professor Cummings to VSU this September for a visit and a symposium that her home department will spearhead. It is expected that some possible collaborations could be explored depending on the unique needs of the region. This is the first time for a Harvard professor to visit VSU.

Ea’s homecoming comes at a pivotal time for her alma mater as it prepares to open its College of Medicine. She believes that the interdisciplinary research she brings from the United States and Japan can significantly contribute to this bold expansion in medical education.

Inspired by fellow scientists who chose to return home and guided by her parents, professors Edgardo Tulin and Anabella Tulin, both institution builders and scientists, Ea sees her path not only as personal but also purposeful.

“Doing research for Filipinos is something to be very proud of,” she affirmed.

And with that spirit, this young Filipina scientist returns home, not just to teach and research, but to build a future where science is rooted in service and powered by hope. – Rappler.com",NewsData.io,,,not found,,,,"rappler, Rappler Philippines, rappler.com  ",,https://ground.news/interest/rappler_028051,not found,RIGHT-CENTER (3.8),HIGH (1.7),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Magazine,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Right,Unknown,Unknown,Lean Left,rappler.com,,rappler,177,USA,,,,

Today in History for Aug. 3:

On this date:

In 1460, King James II of Scotland died in a cannon explosion.

In 1492, Italian explorer Christopher Columbus sailed from Palos, Spain, with 119 men and three ships - the ""Nina,"" ""Pinta"" and ""Santa Maria"" - on his first voyage to the New World. Supported by the king and queen of Spain, he sailed in search for a new passage to China. Instead, he came upon many West Indies islands.

In 1527, Captain John Rut wrote the first recorded letter from the New World to the old. He sent a report to England's King Henry the Eighth about conditions in Newfoundland and Labrador.

In 1583, the first English settlement in North America was founded at St. John's, after Sir Humphrey Gilbert proclaimed England's authority over Newfoundland. On his return voyage home, Gilbert and his ship were lost at sea.

In 1751, the first printing press in Canada was set up in Halifax by Bartholomew Green.

In 1778, the ""La Scala"" opera house opened in Milan.

In 1811, Elisha Graves Otis, who invented the elevator brake, was born near Halifax, Vt. His safety device, first demonstrated publicly in 1854, made skyscrapers a practical reality.

In 1914, Germany declared war on France and Belgium at the outset of the First World War.

In 1916, Irish nationalist Sir Roger Casement was hanged in London after being convicted of treason for plotting to win Irish independence by revolution. Casement, who was knighted for his work in the British consular service, had sought German aid for a rebellion that was planned for Easter of 1916. But the seizure of a rebel arms shipment and Casement's capture doomed the uprising to failure.

In 1924, author Leon Uris was born in Baltimore, Md.

In 1940, Latvia became the 14th Soviet republic.

In 1949, the National Basketball Association was formed by a merger of the Basketball Association of America and the National Basketball League.

In 1977, the Canadian government rejected aboriginal demands for their own political territory in the Northwest Territories. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau said Ottawa would never agree to a political territory based solely on race.

In 1980, the Moscow Summer Olympics, boycotted by the United States and many other western countries, ended. Russia and East Germany captured most of the medals. The boycott of the Games was part of the U.S. response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. The Soviet Union and the Eastern bloc boycotted the next Summer Olympics, held in Los Angeles in 1984.

In 1981, 13,000 U.S. air traffic controllers went on strike, despite President Ronald Reagan's warning that they would be fired if they did not return to work. Reagan carried out his threat.

In 2005, over 40 cars of a CN Rail train derailed, spilling thousands of litres of oil and a toxic pole-treating chemical in Lake Wabamun, Alta.

In 2006, four Canadian soldiers from Princess Patricia’s Canadian Light Infantry were killed and 10 others injured in Taliban ambush in Pashmul, Afghanistan. (The four soldiers were Sgt. Vaughn Ingram, Cpl. Bryce Keller, Cpl. Christopher Reid, and Pte. Kevin Dallaire).

In 2008, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize-winning author whose books chronicled the horrors of the Soviet gulag system, died from a chronic heart condition. He was 89.

In 2010, British Petroleum began the successful ""static kill"" of the blown-out well in the Gulf of Mexico that caused the biggest offshore oil leak in U.S. history. The first step was to force a slow torrent of heavy mud down the broken wellhead to push the crude back to its underground source. The next day, BP pumped fresh cement to keep the oil from finding its way back out.

In 2010, Calgary-based Talisman Energy announced it would pay US$858 million for a 49 per cent interest in BP's Colombian oil and gas exploration assets, while Ecopetrol SA would hold the other 51 per cent. BP was divesting up to $30 billion of assets to help it pay the huge price tag for the cleanup costs of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.

In 2010, a brazen daylight attack on Kandahar Airfield resulted in the deaths of up to 10 Taliban fighters as military officials called the attempt amateurish and desperate. Three Canadian soldiers received a commendation for their courage in responding to the attack.

In 2010, the Manitoba government apologized for its part in uprooting members of the Sayisi Dene band in 1956 from their north-central homeland and relocating them to a Churchill community where they were unable to pursue their traditional lifestyle.

In 2010, a warehouse driver at a Manchester, Conn., beer distributorship went on a shooting rampage, killing eight people and injuring two before committing suicide. He had just left a disciplinary hearing where he was asked to resign because he stole beer from the company.

In 2011, the Muscular Dystrophy Association announced that comedian Jerry Lewis was no longer its national chairman and he would not appear on that year's telethon, ending a 45-year run in which he raised $1.66 billion. Lewis did not comment publicly on reasons for the split. Despite his absence, officials said the telethon on Sept. 4 raised nearly $61.5 million, an increase of about $2.6 million over 2010.

In 2011, according to a study by the Interactive Advertising Bureau of Canada, online advertising revenues pushed the Internet past daily newspapers as the second largest ad revenue source in Canada, after TV.

In 2014, a 6.1-magnitude earthquake struck China's mountainous farming region of Ludian county, killing over 600 people and injuring 2,400 others.

In 2018, a 77-year-old man was killed when a powerful tornado touched down west of Lake Manitoba, lifting several homes off their foundations and sweeping one vehicle into the lake. The RCMP said the man was found dead outside what remained of his wrecked home in Alonsa.

In 2018, the federal government delivered $11 million to help the City of Toronto defray some of the costs associated with an influx of asylum seekers.

In 2019, a mass shooting at a Walmart store in El Paso, Texas left 22 dead and 24 injured after a lone gunman opened fire. The FBI was investigating the shooting as an act of domestic terrorism and a possible hate crime - a charge that could see the gunman facing the death penalty. Authorities said following his arrest, the accused shooter, 21-year-old gun Patrick Crusius, told investigators that he allegedly set out to kill as many Mexicans as he could.

In 2019, the songwriter who co-founded Village People and co-wrote their classic hits ""Y-M-C-A,"" ""Macho Man"" and ""In the Navy"" died in Paris at the age of 82. Henri Belolo founded the six-member Village People with Jacques Morali and lead singer Victor Willis in 1977. In 1978, the group released the international hit ""Y-M-C-A,'' co-written by Belolo. It peaked at Number Two on the Billboard chart.

In 2019, the Pro Football Hall of Fame welcomed eight new members in Canton, Ohio. Former players to be enshrined were tight end Tony Gonzalez, defensive backs Champ Bailey, Ed Reed and Ty Law, centre Kevin Mawae and senior selection Johnny Robinson, a defensive back who helped the Chiefs win Super Bowl 4. They are joined by two contributors: the late owner of the Denver Broncos, Pat Bowlen, and Gil Brandt, former personnel director for the Dallas Cowboys, now the NFL's top draft consultant.

In 2020, Quebec increased the limits on indoor and outdoor public gatherings from 50 people to 250 people as part of measures to control COVID-19. The province's health minister said despite the relaxed rules, COVID-19 continues to circulate in Quebec, especially among young people. Christian Dube asked all Quebecers to work together to reduce the number of new daily cases in case of a second wave.

In 2020, Andrew Furey won his bid to become premier of Newfoundland and Labrador. Furey, a physician and founder of a charity, beat out John Abbott in the contest to replace Premier Dwight Ball as Liberal leader. Before the result was even announced, Abbott issued a statement calling for an independent audit of the voting process.

In 2021, an investigation found that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed multiple current and former state government employees. Two outside lawyers concluded that the Cuomo administration was a hostile work environment and that it was rife with fear and intimidation. Cuomo faced multiple allegations the previous winter that he inappropriately touched and sexually harassed women who worked with him or who he met at public events. Cuomo had always denied touching anyone inappropriately.

In 2021, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau was cleared by the federal ethics watchdog over Liberal MPs using their office budgets to hire the services of a company run by one of his lifelong friends. Conservative MP Michael Barrett had asked Mario Dion to investigate after a report surfaced that most Liberal MPs hired two companies, including friend Tom Pitfield's Data Sciences, to help them manage constituency casework. The ethics commissioner said the prime minister was not involved with the contract, and there was no reason to believe he was trying to further Pitfield's private interests.

In 2023, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau appointed educator and community advocate Edith Dumont as Ontario's first francophone lieutenant-governor. She replaced Elizabeth Dowdeswell.

In 2024, Canadian swimming phenom Summer McIntosh became Canada's first triple gold medallist in an Olympic Games with a win in the 200-metre individual medley in Paris. The Toronto teen also won gold medals in the 200 butterfly and 400 I-M, plus a silver in the 400 freestyle.

Peter Sellers, born a century ago come September, wouldn’t be allowed his career today. All those funny racial stereotypes of his – the caricatured Frenchmen, Italians, Jews and goodness-gracious-me Indians – are in clear breach of the codes of political correctness. Nevertheless, Sellers continues to obsess audiences. Despite everything, he remains hysterical: the deadpan Clouseau falling into ponds and out of windows; the American president in Dr Strangelove, trying to explain down the phone to a drunken Russian leader that, unfortunately, a nuclear holocaust is imminent. Article continues below ADVERTISEMENT There was a mythic dimension to Sellers’ story. He had everything – fame and riches – and it wasn’t enough. He was a comedian with a tragic inability to enjoy life. He was world famous and desperately lonely. At the height of his fame as Inspector Clouseau, Sellers’ personal eccentricity tipped over the edge to become a genuine, and frightening, prolonged bout of insanity. As Blake Edwards, director of the Pink Panther franchise, was compelled to say: “If you went into a Victorian lunatic asylum and saw the worst patient in the place, he’d be better off than Peter Sellers.” Sellers was famous for his phobias about green and purple, apparently the colours of death. A bathroom at the Crillon Hotel in Paris was bricked up because the tiles were green. Publicity girls were sacked if they wore purple clothes. A casino scene in Vienna was re-shot because the billiard table was of green baize. Sellers had a castle in Ireland, which he abandoned because it was surrounded by green grass. Other bonkers bits of behaviour included the tearing down of a film set, because Sellers’ mother appeared to the star in a dream to say it was unlucky. A pirate comedy was re-dubbed because Sellers’ character, Scratch, was a nickname for the devil – the role had to become Scratcher instead. Sellers would only sleep with his head pointing polar north. He went through a phase of eating nothing except hard boiled eggs. The Sellers who spent the maiden voyage of the QE2 dressed as Fagin, picking the pockets of the First-Class passengers (“You’ve heard of the Ship’s Purser? I’m the Ship’s Fagin”), or who bought a mansion in Chipperfield, Hertfordshire, because “I need somewhere I can invite Princess Margaret for tea,” or who was so keen on table-rapping and seances he’d dress up as Madame Zsa-Zsa (“Who knows all and sees all”), was of a piece with the maniac who tried to exterminate underlings and ignore the existence of his children. To Sellers, the universe was one mad black farce – and underneath Sellers the prankster there was impending danger. He could never comprehend the reality of other people’s feelings. He was incapable of considering the effect of his actions. The world was a pantomime in which he took all the roles, the ogres and the clowns.

Peter Sellers and his wife Britt Ekland pictured with their first baby, Victoria

He’d phone up director and screenwriter Bryan Forbes, for instance, all jolly. Bryan and his wife, Nanette Newman, would whizz round to see him – and he’d be ripping the curtains from the walls or throttling a parrot. He’d then announce he wanted to marry Nanette. “If you said ‘hello’ to him in the wrong sort of way, that could set him off,” his son Michael remembered. Blake Edwards is convinced that, had Sellers not died when he did, in 1980, “he would have gone on to become crazier and crazier. I think he was close to certifiable, and I don’t say that facetiously. At some point in his life, he would have killed himself”. During the later Pink Panthers, Sellers said his inspiration came from voices in his head put there by God. Today his subversive and immoderate behaviour, and his weird inner-life, continues to make him irresistible. If he behaved badly – getting disillusioned with a script, the director and his co-stars, and wanting everything scrapped; being morbidly sexually jealous with his womenfolk – it’s because Sellers couldn’t help himself. Everybody and everything were kept at a distance As he once tried to explain: “I have no personality of my own, you see. I have no concrete image of myself. I look in the mirror and what I see is someone who has never grown up – a crashing sentimentalist who alternates between great heights and black depths. “You know, it’s a funny thing, but when I’m doing a role, I feel it’s the role doing the role, if you know what I mean. When someone tells me, ‘You were great as so-and-so,’ I feel they should be telling this to so-and-so, and when I finish a picture, I feel a horrible sudden loss of identity.” Was he genuinely such an empty space? Sellers, despite what he claimed, had a fascinating background. He was descended from a family of bare-knuckle East End prize fighters and carnival showmen. His clinging, whining mother, Peg, was a quick-change artiste in the music hall. His father, Bill, was a ukelele player and soft-shoe shuffle dancer. The young Peter, born in Southsea, whilst his parents were on tour, was raised in this ghostly, twilit world of shabby provincial theatres and end-of-the-pier revues – dog acts, acrobatic midgets, incompetent conjurers, and gypsy violinists. To be able to go from these origins, and to become as big as the Beatles, as Sellers was in the Sixties, is an amazing success story. Yet he’d always be nostalgic for the innocent days before he was famous – and Sellers was peerless at playing little shuffling old figures, versions of his parents, in I’m All Right Jack, The Smallest Show on Earth, The Naked Truth, Carlton-Browne of the FO, The Battle of the Sexes, and heaps of others. Sellers was at his best as a moth-eaten fantasist. The trouble started when he began to believe his own publicity and thought he could be appreciated as a romantic leading man – as another David Niven or Cary Grant. But he didn’t possess their suave charisma. Sellers spent the war in the Royal Air Force, impersonating and mocking officers and playing the drums to entertain the troops. When he was demobbed, he worked in holiday camps and began getting spots on radio, culminating in The Goon Show, with its explosions, gun fire special-effects and army jokes. He dubbed the voices of Churchill and Humphrey Bogart on film soundtracks. He had walk-on roles in little films like Orders are Orders and John and Julie.

His breakthrough came with the part of a fat Teddy Boy in The Ladykillers, alongside Alec Guinness. This brought him to the attention of the Boulting Brothers, who cast him as the shaven-headed, belligerent shop steward in I’m All Right Jack, which won Sellers the Bafta. When Peter Ustinov dropped out of The Pink Panther, Sellers replaced him. And the rest is history. Or infamy. Sellers’ descent into madness was swift. Because his Indian character in The Millionairess falls in love with Sophia Loren’s character, Sellers fell in love with Sophia Loren. He got rid of his wife and children, wishing to be a swinging bachelor. He pounced on Britt Ekland in the Dorchester and married her within ten days. He took drugs to enhance his potency and on April 6, 1964, aged just 38, suffered a near fatal heart attack. Perhaps because he’d pulled through, he now felt he could misbehave as he pleased. He walked off Casino Royale and was discovered in Britt Ekland’s mother’s house in Sweden. Meantime, Orson Welles and the rest of the cast were in full makeup and on full pay back at Pinewood, waiting for Sellers to reappear. The frightening temper tantrums and the irrational, psychotic behaviour put such pressure on his system, when he was examined by doctors for insurance purposes, his electrocardiogram print-outs showed severe abnormalities. When X-rayed, “the left ventricle showed a little rounding just above the apex corresponding to the region where infarction occurred in the past,” it is stated in a report I saw. The medical officer went on to conclude that Sellers was not “an insurable risk. It is a pure gamble”. He was on borrowed time, which must have been a torment – having to turn up on set and be funny, hilarious, a comic genius. No wonder he lived for the moment, unable to know whether he’d feel ebullient or downcast, brilliant or morose. He was happy only in the company of his gadgets, his cameras and fast cars, which he’d replace or abandon with manic frequency. His crowning role was in Being There, playing a hollow man, an isolated nothing person, who copies the words and movements he sees on the television screen. It is a haunting performance, as if Sellers is already disappearing. Like those ghostly old men he used to play in his early films, Sellers is muffled-up and other-worldly, pottering about a frosty greenhouse. A few months after the film’s release, Sellers was dead, having turned bright blue and fallen onto the carpet in the Dorchester, aged only 54. “He was on drug therapy, other mechanical aids, and intravenous drips, but I’m afraid he was just too ill,” said a doctor at the Middlesex Hospital. Sellers’ vivid contradictions, nevertheless, continue to be transfixing. The Life and Death of Peter Sellers by Roger Lewis, with a preface by Steve Coogan, (Quercus, £30) is out now.

Madam — I was appalled to see former justice minister Alan Shatter describe the Occupied Territories Bill as a Father Ted measure and compare it to Jews being targeted by the Nazis (‘Boycott bill would be a gift to Hamas’, July 27).

I believe that Ireland taking this stance sends out a powerful signal to the world that this country is adopting a strong line on what is happening in the occupied territories.

One must not forget that some of the same arguments being posited by Mr Shatter were the same ones that were made against anti-apartheid measures and how this would have a negative impact on black people in South Africa.

I am curious about what Mr Shatter has to say about the seven innocent Gazan children who were recently killed by the Israeli military while waiting for water at a distribution point. This is about morality, not economics.

John O’Brien, Clonmel, Co Tipperary

Criticism is far from being antisemitism

Madam — Criticism of the state of Israel is not antisemitism.

Alan Shatter’s column repeatedly refers to the targeting of Jews, rather than Israel, so he can level accusations of antisemitism. The settlements he refers to have been declared ill­egal by the UN, but he suggests they should not be subject to sanction because there are Jews present. Religion should be a matter of personal choice, not state policy.

Mark O’Hagan, Ballinacurra, Midleton, Co Cork

Zionism is more like English plantation

Madam — A more bizarre and ridiculous statement is hard to imagine than that made by Alan Shatter in your last edition: “Zionism is nothing other than a belief in the right of the Jewish people to self-determination in their ancient homeland. It is no different to the belief that the Irish people have the right to self-determination on the island of Ireland.”

In the first and second centuries AD, the Romans drove out most of the Jews from what are today called Palestine and Israel. In the late 19th century, a sectarian, colonialist ideology was invented in the form of Zionism. This entailed Jewish plantation in Palestine and dispossession of Arabs of the lands where they had been living for almost two millennia.

If a comparison is to be made with Ireland, it is not insultingly with the Irish freedom struggle, but rather with the English plantations that began here in the 16th century in an attempt to supplant the native Irish.

The idea of an “ancient homeland” of the Jews goes back to a situation that prevailed about 2,000 years ago and rests on a theological notion of a “chosen people” in a “promised land”.

As for “self-determination”, that does not attach to a religion, but to a people living in a territory where they have been located for most of modern (and often medieval history), namely the Arabs in historic Palestine “from the river [Jordan] to the sea”.

Daltún Ó Ceallaigh, Rathmines, Dublin 6

Claims about Irish jobs are hysterical

Madam — Alan Shatter has misinterpreted the Occupied Territories Bill, which will probably include services as well as goods. While the value of these is small, the purpose of the bill is to draw attention to Israel’s illegal annexation in the West Bank, undermining the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination.

None of his proposed arguments are correct. The bill does not discriminate against Jews.

The conflict in Gaza would not have ended if Hamas had released the hostages. In spite of Joe Biden’s pleas, Benjamin Netanyahu declared all-out war.

The passing of the bill would have no effect on Hamas. The enforcement of the bill is a matter for the Irish Government, but it must be passed regardless of the hysteria about its potential effect on Irish jobs.

There will be no effect on jobs as countries invest only where it is advantageous to do so.

Teresa Mitchell, Arklow, Co Wicklow

Israel has terrorised Palestine since 1948

Madam — After reading Alan Shatter’s column, I would like to point out that the war on Palestinians did not start after the Hamas outrage on October 7, 2023.

It started with the Deir Yass­in massacre of Palestinians in April, 1948, which led to the mass exodus of 430,000 Palestinians fleeing in terror. Israel has forcibly occupied, ethnically cleansed and practised apartheid against the Palestinian people ever since.

Daniel Teegan, Listarkin, Union Hall, Co Cork

Bill is an important symbol of resistance

Madam — While Alan Shatter earned a serious reputation as a politician, his analysis of the Occupied Territories Bill is flawed.

It fails to recognise the legislation as an important symbol of resistance in a world that turns a blind eye to killing and destruction on a scale that was never meant to happen again.

Mr Shatter is eloquent in reflecting the Israeli narrative, but is unfortunately silent on the other side of the story.

Irish women are ready to fight for trans rights

Madam — John Boyne’s ­article about JK Rowling (‘An ode to my friend JK Rowling on her 60th birthday’, July 27) refers to “grown women” who support trans rights as being “complicit in their own ­erasure” and likens our supp­ort of trans people to “being ready to pin a handmaiden down as her husband rapes her”.

Growing up in Ireland in the 1970s, 80s and 90s, I am one of the “grown women” he refers to. I remember vividly the treatment of women who did not look or act as we were told we should; the vitriol with which queer people were spoken about and treated; the scorn and shame heaped on parents of gay people; the Aids epidemic; the Kerry Babies trial; and I remember Ann Lovett, dying cold, alone and terrified.

The “grown women” of ­Ireland remember very well what erasure and control and lack of bodily autonomy feels like,and it is for that very reas­on that we stand so passionately with the trans community today.

Over 10,000 people marched for trans rights ­through the streets of Dublin. They, like me, simply want for the trans community what we want for ourselves — dignity, respect and the right to make medical decisions about our bodies in priv­acy with our doctors.

Karen Sugrue, co-chair, Mammies for Trans Rights, Co Limerick

Size of march shows where support lies

Madam — On checking my diaries, I discover that I weighed just under 10 stone in 2015, at the time the Gender Recognition Act came into law. Far from being erased, as John Boyne would have it, there app­ears to be considerably more of me today.

I wholeheartedly support the rights of transgender people to live their best, authentic lives, and, as a woman who has been a feminist since the 1970s, I know this does not affect my rights in any way. The 10,000 people who marched at Trans and ­Intersex Pride in Dublin last month would seem to agree.

The “greatest sin of our time” is not transphobia, but, as so often in our past, the failure to believe women when we tell you who we are.

Bernie Linnane, Dromahair, Co Leitrim

Boyne far removed from female minds

Madam — John Boyne writes in support of JK Rowling and especially commends what he describes as her advocacy on behalf of women. He breezily dismisses her critics as being either middle-aged men, young people “indoctrinated by social media” or dangerously misinformed women. According to Boyne, this last group is ­perhaps the worst.

I wonder what makes Boyne such an expert, either on what women need or why so many of us disagree with Rowling’s activism? Might he, too, be a middle-aged man taking out his frustration? Perhaps he should allow Irish women to think and speak for ourselves.

Former taoiseach Charles Haughey was cited by Barry Cowen as an example of how to overstep planning blockages

Planning system works fine without Haughey-style fixes

Madam — Fianna Fáil MEP Barry Cowen presented us last week with his conviction that the Government needs to follow the questionable example of Charles ­Haughey when it comes to planning obstacles (‘Say what you like about Haughey, he knew how to unblock planning — Cowen’, July 27).

I was one of those who appealed in the case that he gives as an example, a Midlands beef-chilling plant that was approved in 2019 and “is still in the courts six years later”.

We appealed in the common good because, chief among other problems, there was a critical question of ­river pollution with a large-scale abattoir and meat processing plant development.

The Environmental ­Protection Agency was directed to give evidence in court regarding the stream that ran through the site. An Bord Pleanála conceded its case as the flaws in its arriving at granting planning permission became evident.

We should all be grateful that the court system upholds the law for the common good. In this, the Banagher Chilling case, the court system allowed equitable consideration of the realities on both sides and facilitated the exposure of more than might otherwise have emerged.

Desmond Kampff, Ballyeighter, Coolfin, Banagher, Co Offaly

McEntee must not turn to usual suspects

Madam — Helen McEntee has announced that she intends to hold a National Convention on Education, calling it the “largest ever conversation on education since the foundation of the State”.

I am delighted to hear this because I am deeply concerned by the direction being taken by the Department of Education, from the imposition of gender ideology to the introduction of inappropriate content in ­Relationships and Sexuality ­Education (RSE).

However, I am also concerned that those allowed to contribute to this conversation will be the usual suspects, namely the organisations funded by the Government to lobby the Government to put in place the things the Government wants put in place, to create the sort of society the Government wants and the sort of people the ­Government wants in it.

Will the voices of ordinary parents be ignored, as they were during the ‘consultation’ on the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA) review of RSE, with the NCCA drawing the conclusion: “It was evident that a large number of online submissions arose through an organised campaign targeting members of the public.”

Did it not occur to them that parents would not have availed of a template provided by a grassroots organisation that did represent their views if they had felt represented by the mostly government-funded organisations they knew would otherwise dominate the consultation?

E Bolger, Dublin 9

Irish across world feel the pull of final

Madam — Reading Tommy Conlon’s fine piece on the great annual migration to Croke Park reminded me of one of my fav­ourite moments ­during the All-Ireland final (‘Get ready to witness our great annual migration’, July 27).

It’s when the commentator throws a shout-out to those tuning in from far-flung places — Sydney, Vancouver, London. A nod, but one that says “we know you’re still with us”.

In the 1970s, I joined a kind Kerryman called Jerry Cronin, a fire captain in Millbrae, California, as he headed off at 6.30am to a house in San Francisco’s Sunset District. Forty of us would gather there in the basement to hear a match relayed via telephone: someone in Ireland held the phone to the radio and someone in San Francisco held another to the speaker system. Crude, but strangely heroic.

Tommy Conlon was right to frame this as a great migration. But it’s not just a movement across the Irish landscape — it’s a deeper, older pull that crosses oceans and time zones. The GAA travels well, and long may it.

Enda Cullen, Tullysaran, Co Armagh

Conlon captured the magic of showdown

Madam — I thought I had devoured all the columns on the All-Ireland football final last Sunday morning in your sports pages.

But once again the best piece was Tommy Conlon in the main section of your paper. It was a pleasant and wonderful surprise to come upon this brill­iant take on the similarity and diversity of the two counties.

His paragraph imagining David Attenborough’s take on affairs was right on the mark.

John McCann, Co Donegal

Are Healy-Raes the men of the match?

Madam — At the All-Ireland football final, I could not help thinking about Shane Ross’s column (‘TDs get €275bn of camouflage for their special deals’, July 27) and the joke about Michael Lowry extracting a promise from Micheál Martin that if Tipperary met Cork in an All-Ireland final, Cork would concede.

As the Kingdom ran away with it last Sunday, I started to wonder if the Healy-Rae brothers won a similar arrangement for Kerry in return for their support for the Government.

Thomas Garvey, Claremorris, Co Mayo

Boring football in need of an overhaul

Madam — Despite the new “improvements” being ­trialled for men’s Gaelic football, this year’s All-Ireland was still ­boring and a hard watch. With nearly 500 hand passes and the over and back possession game outside the big arc, and players virtually unchallenged as one team kept possession, it was like two boxers refusing to engage. And to pay €100 to watch that.

Instead of tinkering with the rules, is it time to go back to scratch and come up with a ­totally new game of football? Wasn’t that what happened at the foundation of the GAA when “Gaelic” football was invented? After nearly a century-and-a-half, is it not obvious the game that was invented is unsatisfactory and possibly irredeemable?

If it’s not possible to come up with a satisfactory new game, maybe the GAA would be better off using the resources devoted to men’s Gaelic football to the further promotion of the genuine Irish game of hurling. After all, didn’t Kerry win a senior hurling All-Ireland before they won a football one?

An Post gets a dire O’Connell reception

Madam — An Post released a stamp last week to celebrate the 250th anniversary of Daniel O’Connell’s birth. It depicts the Liberator resplendent in a gilded chariot being applauded by crowds in Sackville Street with the GPO in the background. The building opposite has a television aerial on its chimney.

Ireland must have been way ahead of itself to have had TV 200 years ago. ­Maybe later this year when the statue of ­O’Connell is unveiled in ­Leinster House, they could place a ­satellite dish on top to show how much the country has ­progressed since his day.

In Japan’s recent Upper House elections, the ruling LDP-Komeito coalition under Shigeru Ishiba lost its majority (barely) but a more striking result was the success of the populist-right Sanseito party, which won 14 new seats in the Upper House. Like its German cousin AfD, Sanseito proposes a sensible mix of policies including strong opposition to foreign immigration and Chinese tourism. Ishiba must not repeat Chancellor Friedrich Merz’s gross error of allying with the Socialists to keep out AfD; the opposite alternative, embracing Sanseito, will produce better policy and much better long-term results for Japan.

Last week’s results represent yet another failure of the left-globalist policy mix that has ruined lives throughout the Western world (including Japan, a wealthy country). Whatever the marginal benefits of free trade, they are hopelessly outweighed in terms of ordinary people’s living standards by the gigantic social and economic costs of unrestricted migration. Demonizing those who point this out or even throwing them in jail as in Britain merely drives an infuriated populace into extremist parties that reject the globalist mantra. Allying with economy-destroying socialists to combat the new populist forces then reinforces the damage – it is a vicious circle of the most unrelenting kind. Germany, having suffered for more than a decade under the East German apparatchik Angela Merkel, is about to discover this through the misdeeds of Chancellor Merz. Japan would do well to avoid it.

Unlike Germany, whose isolationism and chauvinism twice led the world into destructive war, thereby leading to an economically and socially destructive guilt complex, Japan has an isolationist policy tradition far predating the 20th century wars, that it would do well to nurture and preserve. Its Shogunate instituted a policy of non-contact with the outside world in 1639, that it successfully kept in place until 1868. Yet, while a backwater, Tokugawa Shogunate Japan was not an impoverished one; its standard of living around 1860 is estimated to have been around twice that of China or Russia and close to the less developed regions of central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, late Shogunate Japan’s technological knowledge and understanding of markets was much closer to that of 1700 England than of mediaeval Europe.

The generator of Japan’s healthy late-Tokugawa economy was the Shogun Yoshimune (Shogun 1716-45), of whom I wrote last year.

Yoshimune realized that the prosperity of the previous Genroku period was thoroughly unhealthy, with wealth concentrated in big cities and rich merchants displaying socially destabilizing vulgar ostentation. Therefore, he imposed sumptuary laws on merchants, reformed rice distribution so that peasants received more of the value from their output and encouraged peasants to take up “by-employment” beyond farming which would be free from exactions by the local daimyo feudal lords. Consequently, Japan became a haven of rural entrepreneurship, with for example the low-status peasant Yoshimasa (1807-71) (father of the great Eiichi Shibusawa) making a very good living through wholesaling indigo balls to textile dyers. Yoshimune also changed the restrictive rules to allow the importation of foreign books, so Western industrial and scientific progress did not go unobserved.

Yoshimune’s Japan was in most respects the national ideal for Japanese people today, with few foreigners but relatively high living standards and substantial technological capability. Sanseito’s policies hark back to that tradition; they are far more in tune with Japanese culture than is lowest-common-denominator globalization. Not only would a Yoshimune policy resist fiercely the attempts of the cheap labor lobby to import Third World riff-raff and thereby depress Japanese living standards, but it would also resist the blight of overtourism. In Japan’s crowded society, poorly understood by visitors, overtourism has become a real problem, especially as a high percentage of the tourists are uncouth cheapskate Communist Chinese. A Yoshimune Japan would choose dignity and isolation over the cheap dollars of the tourist industry, particularly at the low end of the market, where the dollars are few and the tourists especially obnoxious.

Japan today suffers from several economic pathologies that a wise government will address, but a weak LDP/Komeito administration, seeking votes from leftist parties in the Diet, certainly will not. Having foolishly listened to the charlatan Ben Bernanke in 1998, Japan now has a central bank that owns a substantial portion of both its government debt and the stock market. It has also suffered from two decades of negative real interest rates and for much of the time negative nominal rates. Now inflation has reappeared, which has the benefit of halting the relentless rise in Japan’s debt to GDP ratio, but has pushed real interest rates further into negative territory. The 30-year distortion of market signals for Japanese investors in stocks and real estate thus continues.

The distortion of markets is exacerbated by the Bank of Japan’s ownership of public debt and shares. Currently, the Bank of Japan owns about 7% of the market capitalization of the Tokyo exchange, including a very high percentage of the country’s Exchange Traded Funds (because they form an efficient way for the Bank to buy stock without favoring one company or sector) – it is now the largest institutional shareholder. In addition and perhaps more alarmingly, as of last September it owned 52.6% of outstanding government bonds. In both markets, prices are distorted by the Bank of Japan’s holdings, thus far above those dictated by a free market. If interest rates rise, the Bank of Japan will make colossal losses, far larger in terms of the economy than the recent losses of the Fed.

The effect of all Japan’s money printing has finally after three decades been to drive down the yen’s value against the dollar – at ¥147 to the dollar today, it is worth a third less than a few years ago, when the rate was around ¥100=$1. That is why Japan is full of Chinese and other tourists – suddenly it has become a relatively cheap country to visit. More alarming is the behavior of consumer prices, which in June were up 3.2% on the previous year, a higher rate of inflation than in the United States. With the 10-year Japan Government Bond yielding 1.51% today, real interest rates are still sharply negative, pushing inflation upwards and further distorting price signals for Japanese industry and investors.

Given the data, it looks likely that Japanese inflation will rise further and at some point, interest rates will rise to give a positive real yield over inflation. Such a development would undoubtedly lead to a crash in the still overvalued stock market and rising discontent among the populace, as well as a severe financing crisis in the Bank of Japan. Should the current government’s policy of increasing immigration continue, there will be an inevitable further downward push on wages, which in real terms are already declining.

The popular policy at that point, and the economically correct one, would be to follow Sanseito and Yoshimune and revert to a policy of foreign exclusion and encouragement of small-scale domestic development. A Yoshimune policy would squash the conspicuous consumption of foreigners and the very rich, and devise ways to encourage small business creation throughout Japan, not just in the overstuffed megalopolis of Tokyo. For such an effort, foreign bankers, with their greed, short-termism and favor for large-scale “churn” in corporate ownership, are thoroughly detrimental. Foreign meddling in Japanese markets by U.S. private equity and hedge funds would thus be heavily discouraged, as it plays merry hell with Japan’s stable corporate structure and introduces unpleasant American tendencies into business life. The corporate ideal for Japan to aim at should be Ajinomoto, created in 1907 by Kikunae Ikeda (1864-1936) to exploit the hitherto unidentified “umami” flavor in monosodium glutamate; today a $25 billion company and wholly independent with only minor takeover activity in its history.

On immigration Japan should revert to its traditional policy of discouraging almost all immigration. High-skill immigration introduces unpleasant foreign practices into the Japanese economy; low-skill immigration impoverishes ordinary Japanese, as well as discouraging automation and robotics, in which Japanese industry is supremely skilled. Tourism should also be discouraged, except at the highest level to allow scholars to profit from understanding Japan’s uniquely beautiful civilization.

There is no question Japan’s political life could benefit from alternation of parties in government. However, switching to the socialists achieved nothing in 2009-12, and would add little to the perpetual government of the already fairly socialist LDP. Instead, let us hope for a government with a strong Sanseito representation. By deglobalizing, a policy in line with the latest international trends, such a government could improve the living standards of ordinary Japanese and thereby slow or halt the country’s demographic decline (because prospects for the future would be improved). It would also preserve Japanese culture from foreign invasions, through immigration, mass tourism or short-termist American financial chicanery.

The optimum road ahead is clear; let us hope that Ishiba has the wisdom to take it.

Agar firdous bar roo-e zameenast, hameenast-o, hameenast-o, hameenast.”

(If there is paradise on Earth, it is here, it is here, it is here.) — Amir Khusrau

Once hailed for its unmatched natural beauty and cultural richness, Kashmir , the crown jewel of India today grapples with a prolonged economic crisis. The Valley’s economy has witnessed persistent setbacks, burdened by conflict, stagnating infrastructure, fragile institutions, and an increasingly disillusioned youth.Economic downfall, in this context, refers to a sustained decline in productivity, employment, and economic justice, marked by falling GDP, rising public dissatisfaction, disruption in business cycles, mass migration, and loss of investor confidence. Tools like the Lorenz Curve and Gini Coefficient help quantify the growing economic inequality in the region.But beyond numbers and policy debates, the economic collapse in Kashmir is also a story of ordinary people of farmers earning less, artisans moving out, students losing hope, and small businesses shutting down.

Major Causes of Economic Decline in Kashmir

1. Terrorism and Geopolitical Conflict

The shadow of terrorism, especially since the late 1980s, has deeply scarred Kashmir’s economy. Persistent border tensions, cross-border terrorism, and internal unrest have not only triggered violence and displacement but also handicapped the industrial and tourism sectors.

The Deccan Herald estimated Kashmir’s economic losses to be nearly ₹15 lakh crore by 2015.

The Kashmir Chamber of Commerce & Industry reported further damages during the 2019 to 2020 lockdown years.With investors wary of long-term instability, industries have hesitated, fleeing to more secure regions leaving behind economic vacuum and despair.

2. Lack of Job Opportunities & Weak Private Sector

The private sector cornerstone of job creation remains underdeveloped due to frequent shutdowns, policy uncertainty, and weak infrastructure. Nearly every fifth young person in Kashmir is unemployed, many with advanced degrees. According to Kashmir Times, even PhD holders remain jobless, waiting years for opportunities or migrating out.The Valley has witnessed a brain drain, with youth seeking education, exposure, and employment elsewhere often never returning.This intensifies the feeling of exclusion among local youth, who feel abandoned by the system.

3. Political Instability and Brain Drain

Recurrent political unrest chokes progress and detonates any attempts at private or international investment. Kashmir’s educated elite such as doctors, engineers, academics frequently move out, leaving critical sectors like healthcare and education crumbling under resource gaps.

This has also dented the emotional fabric of the society. Families are torn across cities and countries in the search for livelihood.

4. Outdated Education System

The education system is often said to prepare students for exams, not employment. Indian industry today demands skills, entrepreneurship, digital fluency not rote formulas.

The disconnect between curriculum and economic reality hampers job-readiness and innovation among Kashmiri youth, stalling the rise of a local entrepreneurial class.

5. Impact of Article 370 Abrogation

The 2019 abrogation of Article 370 promised economic integration, large-scale investments, and a development boom. While some infrastructural projects have kicked off, the expected private sector momentum remains elusive.Trust deficit, communication gaps, and bureaucratic paralysis have slowed real transformation on the ground. The promise still awaits fulfilment.

6. Internet Shutdowns & Communication Blackouts

Kashmir has suffered among the longest internet blackouts in Indian history crippling the digital economy, e-commerce, education, and healthcare.In 2019 especially, schools turned silent, digital startups collapsed, and even patients could not connect with telemedicine services.

Online classes and UPSC aspirants were left in the dark for months.In today’s connected world, denial of the internet is denial of livelihood, it deepens the digital divide and leads to irreparable economic loss.

7. Collapse of Tourism & Handicrafts Sectors

Kashmir’s tourism once provided seasonal employment to lakhs from shikara operators to pashmina weavers, many livelihoods were tied to the tourist economy.The unrest following Burhan Wani’s killing in 2016, the revocation of Article 370, and latest terror attacks like in Pahalgam (Baisaran) have scared away tourists.Local artisans too suffer. As customers dry up, centuries-old crafts like papier-mâché, walnut wood carving, and Kani shawls now face extinction.

Conclusion & The Way Forward

Kashmir’s economic decline is more than a policy challenge ,it is a crisis of dignity, opportunity, and aspirations. To reverse this trend, the government and civil society must co-create a roadmap grounded in inclusion, innovation, and peace.

Key Recommendations:

1.Human Capital Development

Reform the education system to equip youth with skills, creativity, adaptability, and entrepreneurial training.

2.Job Creation & Private Sector Revival

Through infrastructure push, MSME incentives, and public-private partnerships, new jobs can help anchor the young population back in the region.

3.Policy Stability, Peace-building & Reconciliation

Only a secure and politically stable Kashmir can attract sustained investment and restore local confidence.

4.Digital Kashmir

Ensure guaranteed internet access and digital infrastructure to boost e-commerce, gig economy, and education.

5.Empowering Traditional Sectors

Support tourism, handicrafts, and horticulture through global promotion, subsidies, and fair trade networks.Restoring Kashmir’s economic dignity is not just an administrative task, but a national duty. The spirit of Atmanirbhar Bharat must reach its most aspirational citizens ensuring that one day, these oft-quoted lines echo once more with pride:

April 27 (UPI) -- British lawmakers backed controversial government plans Thursday to deter the tens of thousands of people arriving in the country in small boats by making it illegal.

MPs in the House of Commons, parliament's lower house, voted 289-230 to pass the Illegal Migration Bill after the ruling-Conservative government successfully headed off a rebellion by some of its backbenchers.

The bill, which will see all arrivals detained and deported to their own country, or a safe third country such as Rwanda, had met with stiff opposition from about 20 Tory MPs concerned about lumping in unaccompanied children and victims of human trafficking with ""illegal immigrants.""

The MPs, who were calling for a three-day limit on the detention of children that could only be overridden by a court, backed down after ministers promised to consult with them on a ""new timescale.""

The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, The Children's Society, Action for Children, the National Children's Bureau and Barnardo's, have all strongly criticized the bill.

""We firmly believe that allowing unaccompanied children to be detained for any longer than 24 hours is unacceptable and poses serious risks to their health, safety and protection,"" the charities said in a joint letter to Home Secretary Suella Braverman.

Former Prime Minister Theresa May and former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith who tabled an amendment reversing the bill's removal of existing stays of deportation for suspected victims of modern slavery or human trafficking, did not push it to a vote.

""Sending victims back to their own country or a third country like Rwanda will simply, at best, make them feel less secure, and therefore less able or willing to give the evidence needed, and at worst will drive them back into the arms of the traffickers and slave drivers,"" May said.

The bill is expected to encounter bigger problems when it progresses to the House of Lords which could see it amended extensively.

It also faces being challenged by the European Court of Human Rights which has already blocked deportation flights to Rwanda, with which Britain has a migrant-hosting agreement.

The Rwanda policy, which the government attempted to introduce last year, involves a five-year plan to fly asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing and permits those granted refugee status to apply to settle there.

The flights have been grounded ever since the court issued a series of interim injunctions in June.

The bill contains a provision permitting Braverman to ignore future ECHR injunctions in certain circumstances.

When she brought forward the legislation early last month, Braverman admitted there was a more than 50% chance the bill was incompatible with international law.",GNews,-1.15,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/upi-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,45.3,"upi news, United Press International, UPI, upi.com",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/united-press-international-upi/,https://ground.news/interest/upi_0b956e,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/united-press-international-media-bias,LEAST BIASED (1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,News Agency,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,,,,Center,Very High,Center,Center,Left,Center,Center,upi.com,,upi news,2,USA,Y,J,UPI News,Y

The Prime Minister disclosed that Britain had ratified a treaty with France which means those entering the UK on a small boat can now be detained on arrival and returned across the Channel.

It is believed that around 50 migrants will be returned to France each week, with the numbers expected to climb by the end of the year.

Migrants will be detained for deportation in the coming days before being deported.

Sir Keir is facing continued public dissent over mass migration, with protests outside hotels housing migrants across Britain, prompted in part by reports of crimes by asylum seekers.

As it tries to quell mounting anger and show it is taking the concerns seriously, on Monday, Downing Street said that the police should be able to release information on the ethnicity of criminal suspects, after demands for more clarity.

Read our Privacy notice

Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem envisions more “Alligator Alcatraz”-like immigration detention centers across the country, including near airport runways, to boost the “efficiency” of Donald Trump’s mass deportation agenda.

The Florida facility is serving as a model for state-run detention centers, and “the locations we’re looking at are right by airport runways that will help give us an efficiency that we've never had before,” Noem told CBS News.

Noem told the network she has appealed directly to state officials, and “most of them are interested.”

She added: “Many of them have facilities that may be empty or underutilized.”

The administration has reportedly sought out facilities in Arizona, Nebraska and Louisiana, which currently houses the only Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center on a tarmac. The Alexandria Staging Facility sits across from the Alexandria International Airport, which has emerged as the nation’s deportation capital under the Trump administration.

For more than a decade, ICE — which operates under Homeland Security — has turned to corporate shipping and logistics companies for inspiration for rounding up and deporting immigrants. Shortly after he was tapped to lead the agency in March, ICE’s acting director, Todd Lyons, bluntly compared the movement of people to packages.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business, where this mass deportation operation is something like you would see and say, like, Amazon trying to get your Prime delivery within 24 hours,” Lyons told a law enforcement conference in Phoenix in April.

“So, trying to figure out how to do that with human beings,” he said.

Lyons later expanded on his remarks about treating immigrants like packages in an interview with Boston 25 News that same month.

“The key part that got left out of that statement was, I said, they deal with boxes, we deal with human beings, which is totally different,” he said.

ICE “should be run like a corporation,” he told the outlet.

“We need to be better about removing those individuals who have been lawfully ordered out of the country in a safe, efficient manner,” Lyons continued. “We can’t trade innovation and efficiency for how we treat the people in our custody.”

In a statement to The Independent, Homeland Security assistant secretary Tricia McLaughlin said the agency is “working at turbo speed on cost-effective and innovative ways to deliver on the American people’s mandate for mass deportations of criminal illegal aliens.”

“With the opening of Alligator Alcatraz, we expanded facilities and bed space in just days,” she added. “We look forward to partnering with other states to open other similar facilities to house some the worst of the worst criminal illegal aliens.”

Named Alligator Alcatraz by state and federal officials, a 3,000-bed detention center opened in south Florida last month within the Dade-Collier Training and Transition Airport, roughly 43 miles from Miami in the middle of the Everglades.

A federal lawsuit accuses the facility of blocking detainees from legal counsel and forcing people into “overcrowded, unsanitary, and harsh conditions” with inadequate food, flood-prone cells, and “excessive use of force” from guards that sent at least one man to a hospital.

It’s also unclear who is actually running the facility and who wants to take responsibility for it. Government lawyers could not immediately answer in court whether the federal government or Florida is responsible.

In court filings, immigration officials claimed that the facility is operating through the federal 287(g) program, which allows local and state law enforcement agencies to enforce federal immigration law. ICE has inked nearly 800 such agreements covering 40 states.

“We need to get to the bottom of the interplay between the federal and state authorities on who’s running this thing,” Florida District Judge Rodolfo A. Ruiz II said during a recent court hearing in a lawsuit against the facility.

The makeshift facility is expected to cost roughly $450 million within its first year, at roughly $245 per inmate bed per night, according to DHS. ICE spent roughly $187 per adult detainee per day in 2023.

Still, Noem claims that the Alligator Alcatraz model is “much better” than ICE’s current arrangement with local jails and for-profit prison companies, which operate a vast majority of the nation’s detention centers.

Funding for Alligator Alcatraz largely comes from FEMA’s Shelter and Services Program.

The incoming wave of state-run detention centers is expected to tap into $45 billion in new funding for ICE as part of Trump’s “big, beautiful bill.” The bill also allocates $30 billion for an aggressive recruitment campaign to hire another 10,000 ICE agents.

Altogether, the bill earmarks more than $170 billion for immigration enforcement — a boon to for-profit contractors and cash-strapped states looking to tap into billions of taxpayer dollars.

Putting those new facilities near airports and runways will help ICE cut costs by “facilitating quick turnarounds,” Noem told CBS.

“They’re all strategically designed to make sure that people are in beds for less days,” Noem said. “It can be much more efficient once they get their hearings, due process, paperwork.”",GNews,-6.88,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/independent-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,38.49,"the independent, The Independent UK, independent.co.uk  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/,https://ground.news/interest/the-independent,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/independent-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,,,-2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,independent.co.uk,,the independent,56,United Kingdom,,,,

After he was arrested outside his Virginia apartment in March, Georgetown University professor Badar Khan Suri was briefly detained in the state before being put on a plane bound for an immigration detention center more than 1,000 miles away.

Suri — who was targeted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement for his Palestinian activism and his family ties to Gaza — arrived at the only ICE facility that doubles as an airport, without his attorneys having any idea where he was.

Officers told Suri that he had entered the nation’s “super deportation center,” according to his attorneys.

The college professor was shackled at the ankles and handcuffed then marched into a 70,000 square foot “staging facility” in Alexandria, Louisiana, which has emerged as the nexus point for President Donald Trump’s mass deportation machine.

Suri is far from alone. Since Trump returned to the White House, more than 20,000 people en route to other detention centers have passed through the Louisiana facility — which ICE officials have long aspired to operate like corporate giants FedEx and Amazon.

ICE’s acting director Todd Lyons has bluntly compared the movement of people to packages.

“We need to get better at treating this like a business, where this mass deportation operation is something like you would see and say, like, Amazon trying to get your Prime delivery within 24 hours,” Lyons told a law enforcement conference in Phoenix earlier this year.

“So, trying to figure out how to do that with human beings,” he said.

The idea of “running the government like a business” has taken root inside ICE over the last decade with lucrative public-private partnerships between the federal government and for-profit contractors, which operate roughly 90 percent of all ICE detention centers.

Since before the Trump administration, the ICE field office in New Orleans — which is responsible for removal operations in Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Tennessee — was modeling operations after shipping giant FedEx and its “spoke-hub” model.

Detainees are temporarily held in detention “hubs” before they’re sent to a network of detention center “spokes” where they wait to be deported.

In Suri’s case, he arrived at the Alexandria “hub” before he was moved to a regional “spoke” in Texas.

The idea for a staging facility in Louisiana “started on a cocktail napkin” at Ruth’s Chris steakhouse, according to Philip Miller, a former ICE official in New Orleans who went on to work for an IT firm that contracts with federal law enforcement.

Miller sought “a more effective and efficient way of moving the growing number of foreign detainees,” according to 2015 newsletter from GEO Group, the private prison contractor that operates the Alexandria facility.

Trump’s border czar Tom Homan tapped former GEO Group executive David Venturella to support the administration’s deportation agenda, and he is now serving in a top role at ICE managing contracts for immigrant detention centers, according to The Washington Post.

Meanwhile, Daniel Bible, who worked at ICE for 15 years, including a year as the executive associate director of removal operations, left the agency in November 2024 to join GEO Group as its executive vice president.

GEO Group referred The Independent to ICE for comment.

Lyons, who has helmed ICE since March, addressed his now-viral remarks about treating immigrants like packages in an interview the following month.

“The key part that got left out of that statement was, I said, they deal with boxes, we deal with human beings, which is totally different,” he told Boston 25 News.

ICE “should be run like a corporation”, he told the outlet.

Fourteen of the 20 largest ICE detention centers in the U.S. are in Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, a network that immigrant advocates have labelled “deportation alley.” The jails — most of which are operated by private prison companies — hold thousands of people each year.

More than 7,000 people are currently jailed in Louisiana’s immigration detention centers while Texas facilities are holding more than 12,000. More than 56,000 people are in ICE detention across the country.

But Louisiana is home to the nation’s only ICE detention center with a tarmac. The facility in Alexandria has become the nation’s busiest deportation airport with 1,200 flights to other U.S. detention centers and more than 200 planes leaving the country since Trump took office.

ICE has operated at least 209 deportation flights in June, the highest level since 2020. During the first six months of Trump's second presidency, ICE removed nearly 150,000 people from the U.S.

Alexandria, a city of roughly 44,000 people, is the ninth largest in the state but surrounded by forest and swampland, with summer temperatures regularly climbing into triple digits with humidity levels exceeding 70 percent.

Detainees at the facility in Alexandria cannot be held for more than 72 hours, and the facility does not permit access to visitors or even legal counsel, according to attorneys.

Suri was held there for three days before being transferred to a Texas detention center where he was housed in the “TV room,” according to his attorneys. He was given only a thin plastic mattress. Suri was released after spending eight weeks in detention amid an ongoing legal battle.

Louisiana locks up more people per capita than any other U.S. state, in a country with one of the highest incarceration rates on the planet.

Most incarcerated people in Louisiana are in local jails, and the state pays sheriffs a daily rate per inmate, creating what civil rights groups fear is a cruel pay-to-play system that incentivizes locking people up.

In 2017, the state’s Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards advanced legislation to reduce the state’s prison population, which ultimately fell by more than 8,000 over the next five years.

But at the same time, the first Trump administration was ramping up immigration arrests and expanding capacity to hold immigrants in detention.

Following Trump’s 2016 victory, ICE expanded the nation’s immigration detention system by more than 50 percent, with contracts for private companies to operate at least 40 new detention facilities. Companies including GEO Group, CoreCivic and LaSalle Corrections own or operate facilities that jail the majority of immigrants.

All but one of Louisiana’s nine facilities are run by private prison firms.

The 400-bed detention center in Alexandria is run by GEO Group, whose stock is valued at roughly $4 billion.

Inside, dorm-style units hold up to 80 people each, and each includes an expansive “processing area” with rows of benches and walls lined with hundreds of shackles. People who are processed at the facility from arriving flights are placed in five-point restraints and forced to sit on the benches, according to immigration attorneys.

Before it opened in 2014, ICE transported people by bus from different jails to a local commercial airport or Alexandria International Airport, a converted military base that has emerged as what human rights groups called a “national nerve center” for ICE Air, the group of charter airlines contracted with the agency to operate deportation flights.

“Alexandria allows the concentrated detention and staging of hundreds of people at a time, optimizing efficiency of ICE’s deportation machine,” according to a 2024 report from a coalition of human rights groups.

In August 2017, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties found that the Alexandria facility “is not properly screening for and identifying detainees at risk for suicide” and “does not provide mental health treatment and programming,” the report found.

That civil rights office was among bureaus within Homeland Security that have been abruptly shuttered under Trump’s second administration.

Alexandria is a two-hour drive from Baton Rouge and more than three hours away from New Orleans, where most of the state’s immigration attorneys live and practice.

That distance has made access to legal counsel for the nearly 8,000 people in Louisiana’s detention facilities enormously difficult. There is little if any access to the internet or law libraries and few chances to privately speak with family or attorneys.

To visit detainees at another facility, the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center, roughly 200 miles from New Orleans, Tulane University law professor Mary Yanik and students with the Immigrants’ Rights Law Clinic said they leave by 5:30 a.m. and return as late as 10 p.m., in order to speak with as many people as possible.

“That is a grueling schedule, if you think about the number of hours for a single visit with a client for a single court hearing,” she told The Independent earlier this year. “They feel forgotten. They feel like they’re screaming into a void.”

The most common question among them is “why am I here?”

“They’re so disoriented by what was happening to them, and so confused. At least one person thought they were in Texas,” she said. “‘What is going on? Can’t I just go home?’”",GNews,-6.88,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/independent-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,38.49,"the independent, The Independent UK, independent.co.uk  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/,https://ground.news/interest/the-independent,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/independent-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,,,-2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,independent.co.uk,,the independent,56,United Kingdom,,,,

Before it opened in 2014, ICE transported people by bus from different jails to a local commercial airport or Alexandria International Airport, a converted military base that has emerged as what human rights groups called a “national nerve center” for ICE Air, the group of charter airlines contracted with the agency to operate deportation flights.

“Alexandria allows the concentrated detention and staging of hundreds of people at a time, optimizing efficiency of ICE’s deportation machine,” according to a 2024 report from a coalition of human rights groups.

In August 2017, the Department of Homeland Security’s Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties found that the Alexandria facility “is not properly screening for and identifying detainees at risk for suicide” and “does not provide mental health treatment and programming,” the report found.

That civil rights office was among bureaus within Homeland Security that have been abruptly shuttered under Trump’s second administration.

Alexandria is a two-hour drive from Baton Rouge and more than three hours away from New Orleans, where most of the state’s immigration attorneys live and practice.

That distance has made access to legal counsel for the nearly 8,000 people in Louisiana’s detention facilities enormously difficult. There is little if any access to the internet or law libraries and few chances to privately speak with family or attorneys.

To visit detainees at another facility, the Pine Prairie ICE Processing Center, roughly 200 miles from New Orleans, Tulane University law professor Mary Yanik and students with the Immigrants’ Rights Law Clinic said they leave by 5:30 a.m. and return as late as 10 p.m., in order to speak with as many people as possible.

“That is a grueling schedule, if you think about the number of hours for a single visit with a client for a single court hearing,” she told The Independent earlier this year. “They feel forgotten. They feel like they’re screaming into a void.”

The most common question among them is “why am I here?”

“They’re so disoriented by what was happening to them, and so confused. At least one person thought they were in Texas,” she said. “‘What is going on?

690,210,"Judge rules against Trump and extends deportation protections for 60,000 immigrants",https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/aug/01/judge-tps-temporary-protected-status-trump-deportation,2025-08-01T03:15:31Z,The Guardian,GB,deportation,"A federal judge has ruled against the Trump administration’s plans and extended temporary protected status (TPS) for 60,000 people from Central America and Asia, including people from Nepal, Honduras and Nicaragua.

TPS is a protection that can be granted by the homeland security secretary to people of various nationalities who are in the United States, preventing them from being deported and allowing them to work.

The Trump administration has aggressively been seeking to remove the protection, thus making more people eligible for removal. It’s part of a wider effort by the administration to carry out mass deportations of immigrants.

Homeland security secretary Kristi Noem can extend TPS to immigrants in the US if conditions in their homelands are deemed unsafe to return due to a natural disaster, political instability or other dangerous conditions. Noem had ruled to end protections for tens of thousands of Hondurans and Nicaraguans after determining that conditions in their homelands no longer warranted them.

The secretary said the two countries had made “significant progress” in recovering from 1998’s Hurricane Mitch, one of the deadliest Atlantic storms in history.

The designation for an estimated 7,000 from Nepal was scheduled to end on 5 August while protections allowing 51,000 Hondurans and nearly 3,000 Nicaraguans who have been in the US for more than 25 years were set to expire on 8 September.

US district judge Trina L. Thompson in San Francisco did not set an expiration date but rather ruled to keep the protections in place while the case proceeds. The next hearing is on 18 November.

In a sharply written order, Thompson said the administration had ended the migrant status protections without an “objective review of the country conditions” such as political violence in Honduras and the impact of recent hurricanes and storms in Nicaragua.

If the protections were not extended, immigrants could suffer from loss of employment, health insurance, be separated from their families, and risk being deported to other countries where they have no ties, she wrote, adding that the termination of TPS for people from Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua would result in a $1.4bn loss to the economy.

“The freedom to live fearlessly, the opportunity of liberty, and the American dream. That is all Plaintiffs seek. Instead, they are told to atone for their race, leave because of their names, and purify their blood,” Thompson said.

Lawyers for the National TPS Alliance argued that Noem’s decisions were predetermined by President Donald Trump’s campaign promises and motivated by racial animus.

Thompson agreed, saying that statements Noem and Trump have perpetuated the “discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population.”

“Color is neither a poison nor a crime,” she wrote.

The advocacy group that filed the lawsuit said designees usually have a year to leave the country, but in this case, they got far less.

“They gave them two months to leave the country. It’s awful,” said Ahilan Arulanantham, an attorney for plaintiffs at a hearing Tuesday.

Honduras foreign minister Javier Bu Soto said via the social platform X that the ruling was “good news.”

“The decision recognizes that the petitioners are looking to exercise their right to live in freedom and without fear while the litigation plays out,” the country’s top diplomat wrote. He said the government would continue supporting Hondurans in the United States through its consular network.

Meanwhile in Nicaragua, hundreds of thousands have fled into exile as the government shuttered thousands of nongovernmental organizations and imprisoned political opponents. Nicaragua President Daniel Ortega and his wife and co-President Rosario Murillo have consolidated complete control in Nicaragua since Ortega returned to power two decades ago.

The broad effort by the Republican administration’s crackdown on immigration has been going after people who are in the country illegally but also by removing protections that have allowed people to live and work in the US on a temporary basis.

The Trump administration has already terminated protections for about 350,000 Venezuelans, 500,000 Haitians, more than 160,000 Ukrainians and thousands of people from Afghanistan and Cameroon. Some have pending lawsuits at federal courts.

The government argued that Noem has clear authority over the program and that her decisions reflect the administration’s objectives in the areas of immigration and foreign policy.

Jet2 have issued a response after Jess Glynne said she ‘felt sick’ over the White House using her viral song in a deportation video.

‌



A video uploaded to X on Wednesday (July 30) by the White House showed handcuffed people being escorted by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) onto a GlobalX flight.

‌



The video features Jess’ hit song Hold My Hand, which has gone viral in recent weeks ten years after its initial release in 2015.

‌



To date, a snippet of the song from a Jet2 advert has been used in 1.9 million videos on TikTok, normally from users showing the highs and lows from their holiday.

The White House captioned the post: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”

In the original ad a woman can be heard saying ‘nothing beats a Jet2holiday, and right now you can save £50 per person’.

‌



Taking to her Instagram story to address the White House’s post, Jess said: “This post honestly makes me feel sick. My music is about love, unity, and spreading positivity – never about division or hate.”

Hours after Jess’ post gained traction, a spokesperson for Jet2.com and Jet2holidays stated that they do not endorse the video.

‌



They told the PA news agency: “Our branding has become something of a viral phenomenon this summer and we are pleased to see how many people have used it in good humour.

“This has put a smile on many people’s faces, just like our holidays do. We are of course aware of a post from the White House social media account.

“This is not endorsed by us in any way, and we are very disappointed to see our brand being used to promote government policy such as this.”

Earlier this month, Jess met voiceover star Zoe Lister on Capital Breakfast to recreate the advert live on the radio.

Jess told the station: “It’s mad because I feel like when I do my gigs, I feel like when I go to sing the hook, I feel like they’re waiting for me to go ‘nothing beats a Jet2 holiday’. It is tempting but I need to take this seriously, it can’t be a joke.”

The 2015 song “Hold My Hand” has become synonymous with the TikTok trend that has emerged in recent months, as people show the “real” side of their holidays and use the Jet2holidays audio from the ad.

The White House also partook in the trend, using the audio to back images of groups of handcuffed migrants being directed onto a plane by blurred-out Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to be deported.

The controversial clip was captioned: “When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!”

It has garnered a significant amount of widespread backlash, including from Glynne, who posted on Instagram: “This post honestly makes me sick. My music is about love, unity and spreading positivity – never about division or hate.”

She joins actor Zoe Lister (who did the voiceover), who slammed the White House for using the viral audio to help “promote their nasty agenda”.

Beyond that, many have been left angered by the flippancy with which the White House has approached the issue.

“Why the f*** was the White House even tweeting about deportation like it's a trend what layer of hell are we living in?” someone on X/Twitter asked.

Another argued: “You can’t shame the shameless.”

Someone else said: “Why the hell is the White House posting a meme using a trendy sound on a video about people being deported? What is going on in America?”

Indy100 has contacted The White House for comment, to which they responded: “There is nothing more unifying and positive than deporting criminal illegal aliens and making American communities safer. The memes will continue until every criminal illegal alien is removed!”

5 days ago

Jess Glynne has responded both Donald Trump and The White House after official social media channels posted a deportation video set to her Jet2 holiday advert.

In case you (somehow) weren’t aware, Jess Glynne’s Hold My Hand was used in a Jet2 holiday advert; sparking countless memes, recreations, and a lot of American confusion. Well, The White House jumped on the trend in a new post, only their specific brand of content has been branded “sick”, “twisted”, and “evil.”

In the video, migrants were herded onto a plane for deportation as the Jet2 holiday advert blared in the background. There were close-ups of faces and handcuffs, with the identities of ICE Agents blurred out.

“When ICE books you a one-way Jet2 holiday to deportation. Nothing beats it!” the video was captioned with.

Reacting, one person scathed on Twitter: “Further proof that the world ended and we’re just living in a simulation. The ACTUAL White House account hopping on the Jet2 trend to poke fun at deportees is mind-blowing.”

“The White House make me sick using the Jet2 sound for an ICE deportation video. How can any decent human being support this?” someone else wrote.

A third said, “This is shameful. Enforce the law, don’t flaunt misery in our faces like it is some accomplishment. Have some respect and human decency ffs.”

Jess Glynne is not happy about her song being used in a White House video.

What did Jess Glynne say about The White House’s deportation video?

It shouldn’t really need explaining why an artist wouldn’t want to be linked with such a video, and Jess Glynne did not mince her words as she condemned the Jet2 holiday usage.

“This post honestly makes me sick. My music is about love, unity and spreading positivity – never about division or hate,” she said.

The voiceover actress, Zoe Lister, who has since become a celebrity in her own right following the TikTok trend, also commented on The White House’s clip.

“What can be done about @whitehouse using @jet2pics sound and my voiceover to promote their nasty agenda?” she said.

People in the comments are urging Zoe and Jess to sue.

The Home Office is being urged to review guidance on what information police release on people charged with serious crimes. There have been allegations that police have tried to 'cover up' alleged offences by asylum seekers.

It comes amid concern over an investigation into the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl. Two men – reported to be Afghan asylum seekers – have been charged over the alleged rape of the girl in the Cheveral Street area of town on July 22.

The Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has said 'we do think more transparency is needed' and now Nuneaton's MP Jodie Gosling and Bedworth and North Warwickshire's MP Rachel Taylor are urging the Home Office to review the current guidance that the asylum status of individuals charged with serious offences should not be disclosed by the police.

READ MORE: Fire service issues major update on safety concerns at Nuneaton flats

They have sent a joint letter to Dame Angela Eagle, the Minister of Border Security and Asylum at the Home Office. In it, the two local voices in Parliament said they were 'horrified and saddened' when they heard about the charges.

It said that the case has highlighted 'serious issues' with current police guidance regarding the identifying of the asylum status of those who have been charged with serious offences.

""We live in an era where information - whether rumours, facts - or lies - quickly spreads over social media and mistrust of authorities is high,"" the letter reads. ""We are concerned that the current guidance is inadvertently corroding public trust in the police and the government.

""This has led to the potential to inflame what are often deeply tense situations by creating a sense that authorities were not being honest with people about the circumstances surrounding the most serious and shocking crimes.""

It continues: ""We note that the Prime Minister's spokesperson yesterday confirmed the government position is that 'all authorities, from the police up to central government should be as transparent as possible when handling these cases'.

""We would therefore ask that the Home Office review this guidance and determine whether it remains appropriate in the era of social media and online conspiracy theories.""

It comes after Reform UK’s leader Nigel Farage and Warwickshire Council leader George Finch claimed in a press conference there had been a 'cover-up' in the Nuneaton case.

Mr Farage said it was a 'cover-up that in many ways is reminiscent of what happened after the Southport killings last year'.

In a letter to the Home Secretary, Mr Finch claimed that a 'cover-up' of immigration status 'risks public disorder breaking out on the streets of Warwickshire'.

Whether they're blooms in your border or vegetables taking root, knowing the optimal time for watering can mean the difference between flourishing and floundering plants

‘Best time' to water garden plants to keep them ‘flourishing' - not always the morning (Image: Getty)

Tending to your garden in the summer can be quite the task, especially when it comes to ensuring your plants get enough H2O. It's not just the quantity that matters – timing is crucial for watering your green friends.

‌



Whether you're nurturing flowers in your beds or growing veggies, getting the watering schedule right can make all the difference between a thriving garden and one that's struggling. Hozelock's Sarah Dixon points out that during extreme summer heat, plants can be ""struggling to survive"".

‌



But she suggests that by watering at the ""right time of day"", gardeners could help their plants ""survive a heatwave and continue to flourish"". This news comes after a man claimed 'My neighbours made a petition to get rid of my dogs so kids can play in my garden' .

So, what's the golden hour for watering? The Express wrote on Miracle-Gro's gardening expert Kate Turner, who advised: ""I always recommend watering in the evening when asked when is the best time to water plants"".

She explains that watering in the cooler evening means ""the water has more of a chance to work its magic, without being evaporated by the heat of the day. This ensures the water gets down to the roots, helping the plant stay hydrated"".

‌



You can do this by avoiding evaporation and ensuring it reaches the roots to keep the plant quenched. Echoing this sentiment, David Andersen from David Andersen Garden Design says: ""Particularly in the summer, the best time to water plants and vegetable patches is in the evening"".

He notes that the cooler evening temperatures allow water to penetrate the soil and maintain moisture for longer. Sarah Dixon adds her voice to the chorus, recommending: ""Watering your garden at the end of the day when the sun isn't so hot.

""This will prevent water from being wasted through evaporation, which can leave your plants dehydrated,"" she added. When tending to your plants, it's crucial to water them thoroughly and directly at the root zone.

Method

Position the hose or watering can nozzle near the base of the plants, directing the flow towards the soil to minimise leaf dampness as much as possible. This ensures that every valuable drop goes straight to where it's needed most, right at the root level.

Nov. 14 (UPI) -- Britain and France have reached a deal to increase the number of officers patrolling beaches in northern France to stem the illegal crossing of the English Channel by migrants using small boats.

British officials said in a statement the number of officers in northern France will increase by 40% in coming months and that France agreed to having British officers embedded as observers to the border control efforts. The BBC reported the number of officers would rise from 200 to 300 in five months.

Britain will pay France up to $74.5 million through 2023 to support the border efforts, including investments in surveillance technology, drones and helicopters and detection dog teams.

""We must do everything we can to stop people making these dangerous journeys and crack down on the criminal gangs. This is a global challenge requiring global solutions, and it is in the interests of both the U.K. and French governments to work together to solve this complex problem,"" Home Secretary Suella Braverman said.

""There are no quick fixes, but this new arrangement will mean we can significantly increase the number of French gendarmes patrolling the beaches in northern France and ensure U.K. and French officers are working hand in hand to stop the people smugglers.""

Official figures reported by the BBC show that over 40,000 people have crossed the English Channel in small boats this year, including 1,800 over the weekend.

British officials said in the statement announcing the deal that Britain and France have prevented more than 30,000 more small boat crossings this year and 23,000 in 2021.

South Korean authorities have begun dismantling loudspeakers along its border with North Korea in an attempt to reduce tensions.

The speakers had previously been used to blast anti-North Korean propaganda and K-pop music across the border, but the South’s new liberal government halted the broadcasts in June.

The move to stop the broadcasts was seen as a conciliatory gesture as South Korea looks to rebuild trust and revive dialogue with Pyongyang, which has largely cut off cooperation with the South in recent years.

But North Korea recently rebuffed the overtures, saying that it had no interest in talking to South Korea.

South Korea’s Defence Ministry said the physical removal of the loudspeakers from the border was another “practical measure” aimed at easing tensions between the war-divided Koreas and that it does not affect the South’s military readiness.

Lee Kyung-ho, a spokesperson for the ministry, didn’t share specific details on how the removed loudspeakers will be stored or whether they could be quickly redeployed to the border if tensions flare again between the two.

Soldiers could be seen unplugging loudspeakers, mounted together like a wall, and taking them down, photographs provided by the defence ministry showed.

There were no discussions between the two militaries ahead of the South’s decision to remove the speakers, Lee said during a briefing.

North Korea, which is extremely sensitive to any outside criticism of its authoritarian leaderskhip and its third-generation ruler, Kim Jong Un, did not comment on the South Korean step.

The South’s previous conservative government resumed the daily loudspeaker broadcasts in June last year following a years-long pause in retaliation for North Korea flying trash-laden balloons toward the South.

The speakers blasted propaganda messages and K-pop songs, a playlist designed to strike a nerve in Pyongyang. Officials claimed at the time that the sound travelled up to 15 miles at night.

Kim’s government has been intensifying a campaign to eliminate the influence of South Korean pop culture and language among the population in a bid to strengthen his family’s dynastic rule.

The psychological warfare campaigns further heightened tensions already inflamed by North Korea’s advancing nuclear programme and South Korean efforts to expand joint military exercises with the United States and their trilateral security cooperation with Japan.

South Korean president Lee Jae Myung, a liberal who took office in June after winning an early election to replace ousted conservative Yoon Suk Yeol, has vowed to improve relations with Pyongyang.

But Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of the North Korean leader, rebuffed overtures by Lee’s government last week, saying that Seoul’s “blind trust” in the country’s alliance with the US and hostility toward North Korea make it no different from its conservative predecessor.",GNews,-6.88,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/independent-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,38.49,"the independent, The Independent UK, independent.co.uk  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-independent/,https://ground.news/interest/the-independent,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/independent-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),MIXED (5.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,Newspaper,High Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,,,-2,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,independent.co.uk,,the independent,56,United Kingdom,,,,

Tourists may be unknowingly putting their holiday at risk by collecting passport stamps when travelling.

‌



Passport stamps are badges of honour for many travellers, creating a nostalgic paper trail of their journeys, reports MirrorOnline.

‌



But, Brits heading to Wales, the United States and the European Union and those flying further afield this summer are being warned that collecting novelty stamps in their passports could cause serious problems on future travels or even see them blocked from entering countries.

According to American Summer camp travel provider Wildpacks, 'souvenir' stamps may seem like a harmless memento, however they can cause serious complications at border control.

‌



The alert comes as more information emerges about when a new border regime for travel to EU countries will come into force.

Because official immigration authorities don’t issue them, some countries treat them as tampering or even a potential security issue.

The stamps are available at plenty of famous attractions including the likes of Machu Picchu, Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch and Checkpoint Charlie, with the inky marks offered as a souvenir.

‌



Tourist stamps are increasingly common at historic or iconic destinations.

But some mimic official travel markings or reference politically sensitive areas — both of which can trigger delays, questioning, or outright denial of entry.

Jamie Fraser, American summer camp director at Wildpacks, explained: “Souvenir stamps have become a bit of a badge of honour for travellers — they look cool, they feel like part of the adventure.

‌



""But the second you let someone stamp your passport who isn’t a border official, you’re not adding a memory — you’re risking the whole document being declared invalid.

“If your passport includes anything not placed there by an official, you’re at the mercy of each border’s interpretation.

""For something that takes up just one square inch, it can cause a world of trouble.""

‌



In some cases, travellers have been forced to replace their passports entirely if a foreign border official considers it damaged or altered.

What the UK government considers passport damage:

Unofficial stamps, markings or writing

Torn or missing pages

Faded or unreadable information

Ink stains or water damage

Loose or separated covers

‌



If you are worried about your passport not being valid, companies such as TUI offer handy passport validity checker tools.

When it comes to making sure your passport is in good working condition, following these steps is a wise idea:

Skip the souvenir stamp – Ask for it on a postcard or piece of paper instead.

Don’t mark your passport yourself – Even small doodles or messages could be flagged.

Do a page-by-page check before you fly – Look for unfamiliar marks, stamps or smudges.

Replace early if in doubt – A clean passport is your best travel guarantee.

700,189,£100m border security boost - as govt vows 'major crackdown' on people smuggling gangs,https://news.sky.com/story/100m-border-security-boost-as-govt-vows-major-crackdown-on-people-smuggling-gangs-13406163,2025-08-04T13:30:00Z,Sky News,GB,border,"The government has vowed to push for a ""major new crackdown"" on people smuggling gangs with a £100m cash boost for border security.

The investment will support the pilot of the new ""one in, one out"" returns agreement between the UK and France, and other efforts to crack down on small boat crossings.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said this new funding will ""strengthen"" the government's ""serious and comprehensive plan"" to dismantle the business model of criminal gangs smuggling migrants across the Channel.

But the Conservatives have claimed the cash injection will make ""no real difference"", with shadow home secretary Chris Philp branding the move a Labour ""gimmick"" and a ""desperate grab for headlines"".

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage also claimed the money won't stop people crossing the Channel, claiming the only solution is to detain and deport those who make the journey.

The funding will pay for up to 300 new National Crime Agency (NCA) officials, ""state-of-the art"" detection technology and new equipment to ""smash the networks putting lives at risk in the Channel"", ministers say.

It will also allow the Border Security Command, the NCA, the police and other law enforcement agency partners to ""strengthen investigations targeting smuggling kingpins and disrupt their operations across Europe, the Middle East, Africa and beyond"".

The new investment comes as official figures show more than 25,000 people have arrived on small boats so far in 2025 - a record for this point in the year.

Asked about the figures on Monday morning, Home Office minister Dame Angela Eagle said that the small boats challenge ""remains formidable"" after inheriting a ""mess"" of a system from the Tories.

""We're making progress, but there's no quick magic that's going to switch this off,"" she said.

""We have said we will get out of asylum hotels by the end of the parliament. We're determined to do that.""

Ms Cooper said: ""In the last 12 months, we have set the foundations for this new and much stronger law enforcement approach - establishing the new Border Security Command, strengthening the National Crime Agency and UK police operations, increasing Immigration Enforcement, introducing new counter terror style powers in our Border Security Bill, and establishing cooperation agreements with Europol and other countries.

""Now this additional funding will strengthen every aspect of our plan, and will turbo-charge the ability of our law enforcement agencies to track the gangs and bring them down, working with our partners overseas, and using state-of-the-art technology and equipment.

""Alongside our new agreements with France, this will help us drive forward our Plan for Change commitments to protect the UK's border security and restore order to our immigration system.""

The £100m investment will also support new powers to be introduced when the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill becomes law, the Home Office said.

This includes the introduction of a UK-wide offence to criminalise the creation and publication of online material that promotes a breach of immigration law, such as the advertisement of small boat crossings on social media.

Research suggests about 80% of migrants arriving to the UK by small boat used internet platforms during their journey - including to contact agents linked to smuggling gangs.

While it is already illegal to assist illegal immigration, ministers hope the creation of a new offence will give police more powers and disrupt business models.

Maybe everyone can agree on one thing: if stopping the boats was easy, it would have been done by now. Whether the home secretary, Yvette Cooper, ever deluded herself otherwise, a year of only limited progress in the government’s mission to “smash the gangs” must have brought home to her just how intractable irregular migration is.

The numbers of those crossing the Channel are as high as ever – partly because of the warm weather and calm waters, but also because the criminals who run these people-smuggling businesses are smart and innovative.

When Keir Starmer said he would bring the same legal powers and resources to the criminal gangs as had been applied to terrorism and drugs, he seemed to have forgotten that those wars are also far from over – let alone won.

Will more of the same work? Cooper must hope so. She’s promising another £100m for the National Crime Agency to recruit more officers, and there’ll be enhanced “detection technology” to defeat the people traffickers. Making those distasteful online “ads” for smuggling services is to be a specific criminal offence.

Less convincingly, the government proposes to financially penalise universities where too many foreign students fail to complete their courses because they use their study visas as the first stage in an asylum application.

How the university applications officers are supposed to vet all their student applicants in this way is far from clear – quite aside from the fact that the right to claim asylum is absolute and universal under the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). This, by the way, is why no migrant seeking refugee status can be labelled “illegal”, even though that is what was laid down in domestic law by the previous administration.

So Cooper is in this for the long haul, making slow, incremental progress both at home and in cooperation with other concerned nations near and far, patiently waiting for the forces of law and order to push their investigations and prosecutions forward. Any single measure, inevitably, tends to get dismissed as hopelessly inadequate.

How, it is asked, can the German authorities stop the trade in dinghies and marine engines? How will a crackdown on TikTok videos stop anyone trying to make the journey? Will the treaty with the French, agreed last month, ever be scaled up to make a real difference? Even if one gang is broken up, surely there will be more ready to take their trade?

Such scepticism is entirely justified, but it is no reason to give up. Cooper’s political pitch has to be that only painstakingly slow, hard work – constantly bearing down on the gangs, working through the vast asylum claim backlog, and getting other countries to take or take back the failed asylum seekers – can succeed.

This dedicated effort has to be contrasted with the deceptively easy solutions promised by Reform UK. Nigel Farage, in other words, does not have the answers and would not solve the problem.

Just the same as Brexit, in fact, when he also made extravagant claims about how it would solve our economic problems, and then blamed everyone else when it left the nation impoverished. Now he’s blaming the migrants rather than Brussels, and his policies – little more than slogans – should be treated with extreme caution.

Leaving the ECHR, for example – which he used to call “Brexit 2.0” before Brexit 1.0 turned out to be a flop – wouldn’t change a thing over in Calais.

Yes, it would make claiming asylum impossible, and it would, perhaps in some cases, speed deportation and reduce spurious human rights claims by criminals. But it wouldn’t stop anyone – refugee or economic migrant – from seeking a better life in the UK, and doing whatever it takes and paying any price (including loss of their own life) in the process.

A policy of “detain, deport”, as so lazily tossed out by the radical right, only works if migrants continue to give themselves up.

If they cannot claim asylum, because the ECHR right to is abolished, then they will not be willing to approach Border Force so that they can indeed be detained and then removed (somehow – again, never entirely clear to where).

Instead, we will have irregular crossings turning into irregular, uncurated landings along the south coast of England. And even if the English Channel was somehow made small boat-proof, other methods would be found, such as further abuse of the visa system. Getting sent to Rwanda, say, only acts as a deterrent if you get caught in the first place. But pushing refugees and economic migrants into the grey economy and slum accommodation run by gangs really would turn them into the criminals they do not wish to be.

It’s not that the remedies offered by Farage, Rupert Lowe, various fascists and some Conservatives are cruel and morally shameful, which they are, but that they are impractical and costly. They’re inured to personal abuse. In the words of Lowe: “You can call me ‘far right’, you can call me ‘racist’ – I just do not care. Detain these men, and deport these men – every single one of them.”

Except it wouldn’t work, for the reasons explained. Even getting the Royal Navy to attack the boats wouldn’t succeed, because there are too many dinghies and too few Navy vessels (and the Navy has other things to do).

The Farage/Lowe way of controlling migration is to sloganise and strike a pose, never to make a practical proposal. Labour’s way is to get it done slowly but surely – grinding hard graft, with some respect for humanity, compassion for the most vulnerable, and dealing swiftly with any criminality.

Top defence officials of Thailand and Cambodia began talks in Malaysia on Monday to hold the ceasefire on the border, a week after the worst fighting broke out between the two Southeast Asian countries in decades.

The meeting of the General Border Committee, a bilateral mechanism established between two neighbours to resolve border issues, will continue for four days, concluding with the meeting of the defence ministers of the two countries on Thursday. The defence ministers' meeting will be joined by observers from Malaysia, the US and China.

The meeting was held in Kuala Lumpur at a neutral venue and was extended from one day to four days at the request of Thailand due to the sensitivity of the situation.

Malaysia brokered a ceasefire with the help of delegations from the US and China on 29 July after five days of fighting killed 43 people and displaced hundreds of thousands on both sides of the border.

Mostly civilians were killed in the border clashes that included artillery fire and jet fighter sorties after the two sides blamed each other for triggering the conflict.

While the ceasefire holds, the Cambodian defence ministry on Sunday accused Thailand of violating the ceasefire agreement by using excavators and laying barbed wire in a contested border area.

Thailand said both sides are maintaining their position without any significant movements, however, it accused Cambodia of reinforcement along the border.

But ""there are reports that the Cambodian side has modified their positions and reinforced their troops in key areas... to replace personnel lost in each area,"" said Rear Admiral Surasant Kongsiri, a Thai military spokesperson.

Cambodia also demanded that Thailand release 18 of its captured soldiers as soon as possible.

Thailand said in a statement that the group are being treated well as ""prisoners of war"" and will be released after ""a complete cessation of the armed conflict, not just a ceasefire.""

The clashes, which began near the ancient Ta Moan Thom temple in Thailand’s Surin province, quickly spread to other disputed areas. Cambodian officials accused Thailand of launching air strikes and dropping bombs on roads inside its territory. Thailand blamed Cambodia for laying new landmines – one of which injured a Thai soldier and prompted a swift military response, including the deployment of F-16 fighter jets.

Brits may be unknowingly putting their holiday at risk by collecting passport stamps when travelling.

Passport stamps are badges of honour for many travellers, creating a nostalgic paper trail of their adventures. However, Brits heading to Wales, the United States and the European Union and those flying further afield this summer are being warned that collecting novelty stamps in their passports could cause serious problems on future trips or even blocked from entering countries.

According to American Summer camp travel provider Wildpacks, 'souvenir' stamps may seem like a harmless memento, but can cause serious complications at border control. The warning comes as more information emerges about when a new border regime for travel to EU countries will come into force.

31,259,Dem senators demand millions for pro-illegal migrant group,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/investigations/3446090/virginia-senators-request-3-million-group-helps-illegal-migrants-work/,2025-06-18T12:00:00Z,Washington Examiner,US,migrant,"Virginia’s two Democratic senators have requested federal funding totaling $1.5 million for CASA Inc., a nonprofit organization that specializes in helping illegal migrants find work and advocating for looser immigration laws.

Sens. Tim Kaine and Mark Warner each disclosed requests for $1.5 million in public funds to support CASA in disclosures filed on May 15. CASA maintains a program that connects employers with prospective employees in the D.C. metropolitan area regardless of their immigration status, according to press reports and the organization’s website. Kaine and Warner’s funding requests indicate that they are seeking to help CASA expand its “capacity for workforce development,” indicating that the funds could go toward the nonprofit’s migrant work placement programs.

CASA work isn’t limited to helping illegal immigrants find work. Pro-migration activism constitutes another pillar of its operations.

The organization’s 2025-2029 strategic plan claims that “White Christian Nationalism poses a grave threat to all of us” and that the ideology has “insinuated itself into the very fabric of the Republican Party’s leadership and permeates political discourse in the United States.” To remedy this, CASA has committed itself to “organize” and “resist” in response to Trump administration policies it views as undermining migrant rights. Indeed, CASA’s website contains myriad photos of its activists staging protests.

On its “community organizing” page, CASA cites securing a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants and “challenging unjust immigration enforcement policies” as its priorities. CASA was also listed as a co-plaintiff on a recent lawsuit against the Trump administration’s effort to end birthright citizenship.

“Senator Warner requested funding for at least 17 separate workforce development projects this year, reflecting his long-standing support for programs that help Virginians who want to work, regardless of their backgrounds, gain the skills needed to contribute to the economy and support their families,” a spokeswoman for Warner told the Washington Examiner.

Tax records show that CASA has long relied on millions of dollars in federal grants to keep its operations running — funding that could dry up, given the Trump administration’s more ideological approach to grantmaking.

“By law, the people who are in the country illegally are barred from holding jobs in the United States,” Federation for American Immigration Reform media director Ira Mehlman told the Washington Examiner. “You have two senators who are trying to help people who are legally barred from working in this country to work in this country.”

Warner is up for re-election in 2026, with some observers seeing potential opportunities for Republicans in the reliably blue Virginia. Gov. Glenn Youngkin (R-VA), who has consistently maintained a high approval rating but is barred from running for a second consecutive gubernatorial term, is seen as a prospective frontrunner for the Senate seat. Republicans are increasingly optimistic about their position in Virginia after President Donald Trump reduced the Democrat’s margin of victory there from 10.2 points in 2020 to 5.8 points in 2024.

In April 2021, Senate Appropriations Chair Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) announced the return of earmarks through the Congressionally Directed Spending process — a system that allows senators to request funds for specific projects in their states often administered by municipalities, universities, and nonprofit organizations. Since then, senators such as Warner and Kaine have been required to publicly disclose their requests for spending items in upcoming appropriation bills.

IMMIGRANT GROUP SUING TRUMP ADMINISTRATION OVER BIRTHRIGHT CITIZENSHIP RECEIVED MILLIONS IN FEDERAL GRANTS

Warner and Kaine aren’t the only Democratic senators requesting federal funds to support organizations known for assisting illegal migrants.

Sens. Alex Padilla (D-CA) and Adam Schiff (D-CA) have requested $2 million and $500,000, respectively, in funding for the Coalition for Humane Immigration Rights of Los Angeles — a group that helped organize the recent violent anti-immigration enforcement demonstrations in California and has called to “abolish” Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Washington Free Beacon reported.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), meanwhile, has asked for $600,000 in public funding for the Chinese-American Planning Council, according to the Washington Free Beacon. CPC is facing a probe from congressional Republicans over allegations that it used federal funds to “facilitate illegal immigration” following the release of a video showing the organization’s chief policy officer advising a group of illegal aliens on how to avoid being detained by ICE.

Kaine’s office did not respond to a request for comment.

106,259,Appeals panel wary of DOJ's bid to lift immigration raid restrictions,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3484100/appeals-panel-skeptical-doj-bid-lift-court-immigration-raid-restrictions/,2025-07-28T23:42:01Z,Washington Examiner,US,immigration,"The Justice Department was grilled by an appeals court panel Monday over its bid to pause restrictions on immigration raids in Los Angeles that were put in place by a federal district court order.

A three-judge panel on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, made up of Judges Ronald Gould, Marsha Berzon, and Jennifer Sung — two appointees of former President Bill Clinton and one appointee of former President Joe Biden — expressed skepticism over the DOJ’s arguments for a stay pending appeal of the lower court’s order.

The Justice Department asked the appeals court panel to stay an injunction from the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, which blocked federal immigration officers from relying on apparent race, language spoken, location, or job as sole reasons to inquire about a person’s immigration status.

DOJ lawyer Jacob Roth faced intense scrutiny from the panel during the nearly 90-minute hearing. The questioning largely stemmed from Judges Berzon and Sung about how the scope of the lower court’s injunction limits immigration enforcement and what the Justice Department alleges was unlawful about the lower court’s ruling.

The DOJ lawyer argued that suspicion for conducting immigration enforcement using one of the four factors restricted by the injunction always comes with additional context, and that cases should not be restricted with a blanket formula for Fourth Amendment concerns.

“The locations are always going to be informed by some context or background or experience or surveillance or intelligence or experience in the field, they’re going to be picked for some reason,” Roth said during the hearing.

The DOJ lawyer called the lower court’s injunction “fundamentally flawed on multiple levels” and argued that the district court did not find the suing parties had a “real immediate threat of a suspicionless stop” sufficient to grant the injunction.

Roth was sharply questioned by the skeptical panel for the majority of the hearing, but the lawyer representing the people suing the Trump administration over immigration operation tactics did present his argument to the judges.

Mohammad Tajsar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California who represented the people challenging immigration enforcement in Los Angeles, argued the appeals court should uphold the injunction.

Tajsar pointed to comments by Department of Homeland Security officials stating that immigration enforcement will continue as evidence that it is not an emergency for the appeals court to pause the lower court’s injunction.

COURTS STILL FINDING WAYS TO ISSUE SWEEPING INJUNCTIONS MONTH AFTER SUPREME COURT RULING

“It’s not clear why we’re on an emergency sort of posture here. The problem is, for them, nothing will change, but for us, everything will change,” Tajsar said. “There are more than there are more than a dozen cities and counties who have come into this court and said that there’s an extraordinary amount of fear and trepidation and injury that’s happened throughout Southern California.”

The appeals court panel did not offer a timeline for a decision on the motion for stay at the conclusion of the hearing, but said it would rule quickly. If the appeals court declines to grant the Trump administration’s stay of the order, the Justice Department could seek an appeal to the Supreme Court.",GNews,11.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Right,Reliable,34.02,"washington examiner, The Washington Examiner, Washington Examiner, washingtonexaminer.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/washington-examiner/,https://ground.news/interest/washington-examiner,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/washington-examiner,RIGHT-CENTER (3.8),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.2),USA,,Magazine,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Right,Clarity Media Group,2005,2.3,Lean Right,High,Lean Right,Lean Right,Lean Right,Lean Right,Lean Right,washingtonexaminer.com,,washington examiner,70,USA,Y,I,Washington Examiner,

In a statement, a spokesperson for the defense ministry said the removal was “a practical measure to ease inter-Korean tensions without impacting the military’s readiness posture.”

The move follows the suspension of propaganda broadcasts in June on orders from Lee, an advocate of reconciliation who has framed warmer relations with North Korea as a matter of economic benefit — a way to minimize a geopolitical liability long blamed for South Korea’s stock market being undervalued.

“Strengthening peace in the border regions will help ease tensions across all of South Korea, and increasing dialogue and exchange will improve the economic situation,” Lee said at a news conference last month.

First used by North Korea in 1962, with South Korea following suit a year later, propaganda loudspeakers have long been a defining feature of the hot-and-cold relationship between Seoul and Pyongyang, switched on and off with the waxing and waning of goodwill.

The last major stoppage was during a period of detente in 2004 and lasted until 2015, when two South Korean soldiers stationed by the border were maimed by landmines that military officials said had been covertly installed by North Korean soldiers weeks earlier.

Played by loudspeakers set up in the DMZ, or demilitarized zone, a 2.5 mile-wide stretch of land between the two countries, South Korea’s broadcasts once featured live singing and propagandizing by soldiers stationed along the border. In recent years, however, the speakers have played pre-planned programming that ranges from outright opprobrium to more subtle messaging intended to imbue listeners with pro-South Korea sympathies.

The programming has included K-pop songs with lyrics that double as invitations to defect to South Korea, such as one 2010 love song that goes: “come on, come on, don’t turn me down and come on and approach me,” or weather reports whose power lies in their accuracy — and have occasionally been accompanied by messages like “it’s going to rain this afternoon so make sure you take your laundry in.”

With a maximum range of around 19 miles that makes them unlikely to reach major population centers in North Korea, the effectiveness of such broadcasts has come under question by some experts.

Still, several North Korean defectors have cited the broadcasts as part of the reason they decided to flee to South Korea. One former artillery officer who defected in 2013 recalled being won over, in part, by the weather reports.

“Whenever the South Korean broadcast said it would rain from this time to that time, it would always actually rain,” he told South Korean media last year.

North Korea, however, sees the broadcasts as a provocation and has frequently threatened to retaliate with military action. In 2015, Pyongyang made good on this threat by firing a rocket at a South Korean loudspeaker, leading to an exchange of artillery fire between the two militaries.

Such sensitivities have made the loudspeakers controversial in South Korea, too, with residents of the border villages complaining about the noise, as well as the dangers of military skirmishes breaking out near their homes.

“At night, [North Korea] plays frightening noises like the sound of animals, babies or women crying,” one such resident told President Lee when he visited her village in June, shortly after both sides halted the broadcasts. “It made me ill. Even sleeping pills didn’t work.”

But it is doubtful that the dismantling alone will be enough for a diplomatic breakthrough.

Relations between Seoul and Pyongyang have been in a deep chill following the failure of the denuclearization summits between Trump and Kim Jong Un in 2018, as well as a separate dialogue between Kim and then-South Korean president Moon Jae-in.

Tensions rose further during the subsequent conservative administration of Yoon Suk Yeol, who was president of South Korea from 2022 until his removal from office earlier this year. Yoon is currently being investigated by a special counsel on allegations that he ordered South Korean military drones to fly over Pyongyang last October.

Ruling party lawmakers have alleged that the move was intended to provoke a war with North Korea, and in doing so, secure the legal justification for Yoon’s declaration of martial law in December.

During Yoon’s term, Kim Jong Un formally foreswore any reconciliation with Seoul while expanding his nuclear weapons program.

That stance remains unchanged even under the more pro-reconciliation Lee, according to a statement by Kim Yo Jong, the North Korean leader’s younger sister, published by state news agency KCNA last month.

“No matter how desperately the Lee Jae Myung government may try to imitate the fellow countrymen and pretend they do all sorts of righteous things to attract our attention, they can not turn back the hands of the clock of the history which has radically changed the character of the DPRK-ROK relations,” she said.

461,259,Judges get emotional on Trump efforts to end immigration programs,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/justice/3488599/judges-emotional-trump-efforts-end-temporary-immigration-programs/,2025-08-03T09:00:00Z,Washington Examiner,US,immigration,"The Trump administration has faced various legal setbacks in its efforts to implement sweeping deportations and immigration policies, with some of the judges issuing orders accusing officials of racism and unfavorable comparisons in dramatic opinions.

Judge Trina Thompson, a Biden appointee on the United States District Court for the Northern District of California, offered the latest lengthy opinion, aimed at the morals of Trump administration officials trying to end temporary immigration programs for foreign nationals.

Challenges to revoking TPS bring racism allegations by judges

In a 37-page opinion Thursday blocking the administration from ending Temporary Protected Status for Nepal, Honduras, and Nicaragua, she accused officials of “racial animus” based on their statements about criminal migrants.

“By stereotyping the TPS program and immigrants as invaders that are criminal, and by highlighting the need for migration management, [Homeland] Secretary [Kristi] Noem’s statements perpetuate the discriminatory belief that certain immigrant populations will replace the white population,” Thompson wrote in her opinion.

Thompson wrote in her rejection that she “shares” the “concern” of those suing the Trump administration regarding the president’s ability to end TPS at his discretion. The Biden-appointed judge added that her court “does not forget that this country has bartered with human lives” and included a lengthy footnote discussing the trans-Atlantic slave trade.

“The emancipation of slaves saw the same pattern, but in reverse. Many whites were uncomfortable with the idea of free non-white people in their communities, even if they had lived in the United States for generations,” Thompson wrote in her opinion. “Plaintiffs’ allegations echo these same traditions.”

Thompson also alleges that ending TPS for the three countries and requiring those who had the temporary status to return to their home country is the equivalent of freed slaves being removed from the U.S. and sent to Africa.

Earlier this year, Judge Edward Chen, an Obama appointee on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, blocked the Trump administration from ending TPS for Venezuela and accused the Trump administration of similar claims of racial animus in his 78-page opinion.

“Generalization of criminality to the Venezuelan TPS population as a whole is baseless and smacks of racism predicated on generalized false stereotypes,” Chen wrote in his March order.

The Trump administration’s official reasons for ending the Temporary Protected Status for the countries have been that the reasons outlined for initially granting TPS are no longer applicable, and conditions have improved.

Other decisions bring emotional responses

While many dramatic opinions from federal judges blocking the Trump administration’s policies have come in TPS lawsuits, judges have also made fiery accusations in other issues. A ruling by a federal judge in Washington, D.C., on Friday made another unfavorable comparison about the Trump administration’s policies.

Judge Jia Cobb, a Biden appointee on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, compared the president’s policies blocking the administration from rapidly deporting people who had previously been paroled into the country to the countries that illegal immigrants have fled in her order.

“This case’s underlying question, then, asks whether parolees who escaped oppression will have the chance to plead their case within a system of rules,” Cobb wrote. “Or, alternatively, will they be summarily removed from a country that, as they are swept up at checkpoints and outside courtrooms, often by plainclothes officers without explanation or charges … may look to them more and more like the countries from which they tried to escape?”

Among the various rulings against the Trump administration in district courts, a case regarding the administration’s cancellation of diversity, equity, and inclusion grants at the National Institutes of Health brought another dramatic racial discrimination claim.

“I’ve never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable,” U.S. District Judge William Young said in his ruling in June. “I’ve sat on this bench now for 40 years. I’ve never seen government racial discrimination like this.”

‘TEMPORARY’ IN NAME ONLY: HOW TPS ALLOWS FOREIGNERS TO STAY IN THE US FOR YEARS

While the Trump administration has faced dramatic and blistering opinions at lower district courts, it has racked up several wins on the Supreme Court’s emergency docket on various issues, including terminating TPS.

Jacob Nathaniel Len, 30, faces a criminal complaint of impeding, intimidating or interfering with the agents during the July 7 incident, according to the press release from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Michigan.

According to the court report, four uniformed officers from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency were in two marked Border Patrol service vehicles while transporting 15 people detained on immigration violations to a correctional facility in Michigan.

While the federal vehicles were traveling on I-96, another motorist approached in a BMW sedan and ""flipped off the agents with his middle finger,"" the report said.

Then immediately after passing the lead transport van, the motorist cut in front of the lead van without signaling and rapidly slowed down. In response, the driver of the van quickly braked to avoid a collision. The driver of the Border Patrol vehicle behind it was forced to quickly brake to avoid striking the van.

This action was repeated twice before the motorist eventually left the freeway.

U.S. Attorney Jerome F. Gorgon Jr. said the actions ""cavalierly endangered"" the lives of the agents, the detainees who were in transport and other drivers on the highway.

""Our agents are committed to carrying out their duties with professionalism and dedication, and we will not tolerate behavior that endangers their lives or the lives of others,"" Chief Patrol Agent John R. Morris from the U.S. Border Patrol, Detroit Sector, said about the incident.

Len was in federal court Monday and released on bond. His next court appearance is a preliminary exam Aug. 25.

SEOUL, Aug. 5 (UPI) -- Pyongyang did not respond to Seoul's plan to repatriate the remains of a North Korean national discovered on the southern side of the inter-Korean border, South Korea's Unification Ministry said Tuesday.

Last week, the ministry announced its plans to transfer the body of the presumed North Korean citizen via the truce village of Panmunjom inside the DMZ. It urged the North to respond by 3 p.m. Tuesday through an inter-Korean hotline that has not been used since April 2023.

Since the North failed to reply, authorities will proceed ""in accordance with guidelines for handling North Korean bodies,"" the ministry said in a message to reporters.

""The local government will conduct a respectful funeral in accordance with procedures for handling unclaimed bodies,"" the message said.

South Korean authorities found a body believed to be that of a North Korean man on June 21 off the coast of Seongmodo Island in the Yellow Sea. He was born in 1988 and was a farm worker in North Hwanghae Province, the ministry said last week, citing an identification card found on the body.

The attempted repatriation was the latest effort by the administration of South Korean President Lee Jae Myung to thaw relations with the North.

On Monday, the South Korean military began removing loudspeakers that had been installed along the DMZ to blast anti-Pyongyang messages across the border, a gesture officials called a ""practical measure that will help ease tensions.""

Last month, Seoul repatriated six North Koreans who drifted into southern waters on wooden boats. The North did not respond to any of Seoul's notification efforts regarding the repatriation plan, which were made via the U.S.-led United Nations Command, but sent vessels to the border to retrieve its citizens.

The Unification Ministry also recently used a press briefing to request that the North give advance notice before releasing water from a dam across the border. Ministry spokeswoman Chang Yoon-jeong called the public appeal a form of ""indirect communication"" with Pyongyang.

North Korea has rebuffed any efforts at rapprochement, however.

710,204,Frequent disasters expose climate risks to infrastructure in South Asia,https://apnews.com/article/nepal-floods-china-glaciers-recovery-climate-change-disasters-monsoons-5cd9dad3eb7a2e94b96951ab25e9617c,2025-08-05T05:01:16Z,The Associated Press,US,border,"KATHMANDU, Nepal (AP) — Floods that damaged hydropower dams in Nepal and destroyed the main bridge connecting the country to China show the vulnerability of infrastructure and need for smart rebuilding in a region bearing the brunt of a warming planet, experts say.

The flooding of the Bhotekoshi River on July 8 also killed nine people and damaged an inland container depot that was being built to support increasing trade between the two countries. The 10 damaged hydropower facilities, including three under construction, have a combined capacity that could power 600,000 South Asian homes.

Another smaller flood in the area on July 30 damaged roads and structures, but caused less overall destruction. Elsewhere in the Himalayas, flash floods swept away roads, homes and hotels on Tuesday in northern India, killing at least four people and leaving many others trapped under debris, officials said.

The Himalayan region, which crosses Nepal and several nearby countries including India, is especially vulnerable to heavy rains, floods and landslides because the area is warming up faster than the rest of the world due to human-caused climate change. Climate experts say the increasing frequency of extreme weather has changed the playbook for assessing infrastructure risks while also increasing the need for smart rebuilding plans.

“The statistics of the past no longer apply for the future,” said John Pomeroy, a hydrologist at the University of Saskatchewan in Canada. “The risk that goes into building a bridge or other infrastructure is generally based on historical observations of past risk, but this is no longer useful because future risk is different and often much higher.”

While damage estimates from the July floods in the Rasuwa region are still being calculated, past construction costs give a sense of the financial toll. The Sino-Nepal Friendship Bridge alone, for example, took $68 million to rebuild after it was destroyed by a 2015 earthquake that ravaged Nepal.

The latest disaster has also stoked fears of long-lasting economic damage in a region north of the capital city Kathmandu that spent years rebuilding after the 2015 quake. Nepali government officials estimate that $724 million worth of trade with China is conducted over the bridge each year, and that has come to a standstill.

“Thank God there wasn’t much damage to local villages, but the container depot and bridges have been completely destroyed. This has severely affected workers, hotel operators, laborers, and truck drivers who rely on cross-border trade for their livelihoods,” said Kaami Tsering, a local government official, in a phone interview with The Associated Press.

Among those affected is Urken Tamang, a 50-year-old parking attendant at the depot who has been out of work for several weeks. A small tea shop he runs nearby with his family has also suffered.

“We’ve been unlucky,” said Tamang, a former farmer who sold his land and changed jobs when work on the depot began. He added: “The whole area was severely damaged by the 2015 earthquake, and just when life was slowly returning to normal, this devastating flood struck.”

Disasters show need for climate-resilient infrastructure

The Nepal floods are the latest in a series of disasters in South Asia during this year’s monsoon season. Research has shown that extreme weather has become more frequent in the region including heat waves, heavy rains and melting glaciers.

Climate experts said smart planning and rebuilding in climate-vulnerable regions must include accounting for multiple risks, installing early warning systems, preparing local communities for disasters and, when needed, relocating infrastructure.

“What we have to avoid is the insanity of rebuilding after a natural disaster in the same place where it occurred and where we know it will occur again at even higher probability,” said Pomeroy, the Canadian hydrologist. “That’s a very poor decision. Unfortunately, that’s what most countries do.”

Before rebuilding in Rasuwa, Nepal government officials need to assess overall risks, including those due to extreme weather and climate change, said Bipin Dulal, an analyst at Kathmandu-based International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development.

The bridge connecting the two countries was rebuilt to better withstand earthquakes after it was destroyed in 2015, but it appears that officials didn’t properly account for the risk of flooding as intense as what occurred in early July, Dulal said.

“We have to see what the extreme risk scenarios can be and we should rebuild in a way in which the infrastructure can handle those extremes,” said Dulal.

Dulal said that large building projects in South Asia typically undertake environmental impact assessments that don’t adequately factor in the risks of floods and other disasters. The center is developing a multi-hazard risk assessment framework that it hopes will be adopted by planners and builders in the region to better account for the dangers of extreme weather.

Resilient structures can save billions in the long run

In 2024 alone, there were 167 disasters in Asia — including storms, floods, heat waves and earthquakes — which was the most of any continent, according to the Emergency Events Database maintained by the University of Louvain, Belgium. These led to losses of over $32 billion, the researchers found.

“These disasters are all wake-up calls. These risks are real,” said Ramesh Subramaniam, global director of programs and strategy at the Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure.

A CDRI analysis found that $124 billion worth of Nepal’s infrastructure is vulnerable to the impacts of climate-driven disasters, creating the potential for hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses if the country doesn’t invest in resiliency.

“Investing a relatively smaller figure now would prevent the loss of these enormous sums of damages,” said Subramaniam.

Subramaniam said that most climate investments are directed towards mitigation, such as building clean energy projects and trying to reduce the amount of planet-heating gases being released. But given extreme weather damage already occurring, investing in adapting to global warming is also equally important, he said.

“I think countries are learning and adaptation is becoming a standard feature in their annual planning,” he said.

Global efforts to prepare for and deal with such losses include a climate loss and damage fund set up by the United Nations in 2023. The fund currently has $348 million available, which the U.N. warns is only a fraction of the yearly need for economic damage related to human-caused climate change. The World Bank and Asian Development Bank have also provided loans or grants to build climate-resilient projects.

In Nepal’s recently flood-ravaged region, Tsering, the local government official, said the repeated disasters have taken more than a financial toll on residents.

“Even though the river has now returned to a normal flow, the fear remains,” he said. “People will always worry that something like this could happen again.”

712,251,Mexican Ranchers Struggle to Adapt as a Tiny Parasite Ravages Their Cattle Exports to the US,https://www.usnews.com/news/us/articles/2025-08-05/mexican-ranchers-struggle-to-adapt-as-a-tiny-parasite-ravages-their-cattle-exports-to-the-us,2025-08-05T04:00:00Z,U.S. News & World Report,US,border,"HERMOSILLO, Mexico (AP) — The United States’ suspension of live cattle imports from Mexico hit at the worst possible time for rancher Martín Ibarra Vargas, who after two years of severe drought had hoped to put his family on better footing selling his calves across the northern border.

Like his father and grandfather before him, Ibarra Vargas has raised cattle on the parched soil of Sonora, the state in northwestern Mexico that shares a long border with the United States, particularly Arizona. His family has faced punishing droughts before but has never before had to contend with the economic hit of a new scourge: the New World Screwworm, a flesh-eating parasite.

U.S. agriculture officials halted live cattle crossing the border in July – the third suspension of the past eight months — due to concerns about the flesh-eating maggot which has been found in southern Mexico and is creeping north.

The screwworm is a larva of the Cochliomyia hominivorax fly that can invade the tissues of any warm-blooded animal, including humans. The parasite enters animals’ skin, causing severe damage and lesions that can be fatal. Infected animals are a serious threat to herds.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture calls it a ""devastating pest"" and said in June that it poses a threat to “our livestock industry, our economy, and our food supply chain.” It has embarked on other steps to keep it out of the United States, which eradicated it decades ago.

As part of its strategy the U.S. is preparing to breed billions of sterile flies and release them in Mexico and southern Texas. The aim is for the sterile males to mate with females in the wild who then produce no offspring.

The U.S. ban on live cattle also applies to horses and bison imports. It hit a ranching sector already weakened by drought and specifically a cattle export business that generated $1.2 billion for Mexico last year. This year, Mexican ranchers have exported fewer than 200,000 head of cattle, which is less than half what they historically send in the same period.

For Ibarra Vargas, considered a comparatively small rancher by Sonora’s beef-centric standards, the inability to send his calves across the border has made him rethink everything.

The repeated bans on Mexican cows by U.S. authorities has pushed his family to branch into beekeeping, raising sheep and selling cow's milk. What he earns is just a fraction of what he earned by exporting live cattle, but he is trying to hold on through the lean times.

“Tiempos de vacas flacas"" — times of the lean cows — as he calls them.

“At least it lets us continue” ranching, the 57-year-old said with a white cowboy hat perched on his head.

Reinvent to survive

Even as ranchers in Sonora intensify their efforts to make sure the parasitic fly never makes it into their state, they’ve had to seek new markets.

In the past two months, they’ve sold more than 35,000 mature cows within Mexico at a significant loss.

“We couldn’t wait any longer,” said Juan Carlos Ochoa, president of the Sonora Regional Cattle Union. Those sales, he said, came at a “35% lower price difference compared with the export value of a cow.”

That’s hard to stomach when beef prices in the U.S. are rising.

The U.S. first suspended cattle imports last November. Since then, more than 2,258 cases of screwworm have been identified in Mexico. Treatment requires a mix of manually removing the maggots, healing the lesions on the cows and using anti-parasite medicine.

Some ranchers have also started retail beef sales through luxury butcher shops referred to as “meat boutiques.""

There are other foreign markets, for example Japan, but selling vacuum sealed steaks across the Pacific is a dramatically different business than driving calves to U.S. feedlots. The switch is not easy.

An uncertain future

With his calves mooing as they ran from one end of a small corral to the other waiting to be fed, Ibarra Vargas said he still hasn’t figured out how he will survive an extended period of not being able to send them to the U.S.

The recent two-year drought reduced his cattle stocks and forced him to take on debt to save the small family ranch that has survived for three generations.

Juan Carlos Anaya, director of Agricultural Markets Consulting Group, attributed a 2% drop in Mexico’s cattle inventory last year to the drought.

Anaya said Mexican ranchers who export are trying to get the U.S. to separate what happens in southern Mexico from the cattle exporting states in the north where stricter health and sanitation measures are taken, “but the damage is already done.”

“We’re running out of time,” said Ibarra Vargas, who already laments that his children are not interested in carrying on the family business. For a rancher who “doesn’t have a market or money to continue feeding his calves, it’s a question of time before he says: ‘you know what, this is as far as I go.’”

713,206,Canadian boater complains of rough treatment by US at border lake,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2025/08/05/metro/canadian-border-champlain-boating-incident/,2025-08-05T04:00:00Z,The Boston Globe,US,border,"So when a US Coast Guard vessel approached him on the lake last month and told him the boat he was piloting had entered American waters, the Canadian citizen was incredulous.

“My life is work, family, and fishing,” said Lallemand, a welder who repairs trucks and tractors. “That’s what I do. That’s all I do.”

BURLINGTON, Vt. — For most of his 60 years, Edouard Lallemand has fished the waters of northern Lake Champlain, reeling in bass near the border of the United States and his native Québec. During hockey playoff season, he casts a line between periods.

“It’s impossible I was in America,” he said.

By his own admission, Lallemand ignored the Coast Guard’s commands and tried to hightail it toward the Canadian shoreline. By the end of the encounter, his boat had capsized, he’d been pulled from the water, and he was handcuffed — bruised and bloodied — in a Vermont jail cell.

“The way I look at it, they kidnapped me from Canada and took me to the United States,” he said.

The Coast Guard said it has investigated the incident and confirmed that both vessels were in the US and that its crew members acted appropriately.

The encounter occurred as the US continues to harden its vast northern border in an effort to curb illegal immigration and smuggling. President Trump’s signature spending bill, signed into law last month, directs some $170 billion to border security and immigration enforcement, including close to $25 billion for the Coast Guard, largely to upgrade its fleet.

The agency, part of the Department of Homeland Security, plays an important, if little understood, part in securing the country’s borders, along with its better-known search-and-rescue, boater safety, and navigational missions.

“As long as the Coast Guard has existed, we have served in this role of controlling borders in our ports and along those maritime boundaries,” said Captain Matthew Baker, who commands the agency’s northern New England operations from a station in South Portland, Maine.

In addition to patrolling the coastal border between Maine and New Brunswick along the Saint Croix River, Baker’s sector is in charge of two large inland waterways that stretch into Québec: Lake Memphremagog in the Northeast Kingdom and Lake Champlain on the border of Vermont and New York.

For the first time in years, the Coast Guard deployed a 29-foot response boat to Memphremagog this summer, Baker said, largely to secure the border. For the past decade, it’s sent a similar boat to Champlain each summer to augment year-round operations at a Coast Guard station on the Burlington waterfront.

“The lake is obviously pretty big, so it’s kind of tough to be everywhere at once,” said Boatswain’s Mate First Class Eric Dahl during a tour of the Burlington station last week.

The portion of the land border on either side of Lake Champlain, known by US Border Patrol as the Swanton Sector, is the busiest in the north, accounting for more than 80 percent of US apprehensions along the Canadian border last year. But for the time being, according to Baker, few people appear to be crossing illegally at the major waterways.

The Coast Guard has boarded 355 vessels along the border in northern New England this year, Baker said — 261 of them on Lake Champlain — but it has encountered no human or drug smuggling. Baker theorizes that while Champlain is 107 miles long, the two sections crossing the border are quite narrow and easy to patrol, which may serve as a deterrent.

The wider of those two sections is Missisquoi Bay, where Lallemand fishes every day he can.

On July 20, the Canadian welder visited his lifelong friend, Alan Miller, at the campground and RV park the Miller family operates near a peninsula that juts south from Québec into the United States. Lallemand borrowed Miller’s 16-foot aluminum boat, as he often does, and motored east in search of bass.

Miller said he saw Lallemand on the water shortly before the international incident took place at around 5:30 p.m., though he did not witness the actual event.

“He was quite a ways in Canada when I last saw him,” Miller said. “He knows where the border is and he would never go on the other side.”

In winter, when the bay is frozen over, Lallemand helps Miller plant red flags in the ice just north of the border to help ice-fishing Canadians avoid crossing into the U.S. In summer, Lallemand uses a pair of buoys and a line-of-sight to the land border to keep his bearings.

But according to a written statement issued by the Coast Guard, Lallemand was about 110 yards south of the border when the agency’s seasonal 29-foot response boat approached him and turned on its lights and sirens.

“Our boat crews know exactly where we are, all the time,” Baker said, citing GPS readings and navigational aids. “He was on the US side of the border.”

According to Lallemand, his conversation with the four-person Coast Guard crew soon became heated as they argued over where they were.

“He started yelling at me like I’m rotten fish,” the Canadian boater said, referring to one crew member. “It’s like they let the dog out.”

Lallemand said he felt unsafe with nobody to witness the encounter, so he started his engine and headed for shore.

What happened next is in dispute.

According to the Coast Guard statement, Lallemande “made an abrupt starboard turn and struck the port bow” of the response boat about 65 yards south of the border, causing the aluminum boat to capsize.

In Lallemand’s telling, the Coast Guard vessel attempted to push his boat south, as if it were trying to move him into the U.S., and then became even more aggressive.

“They rammed me,” he said. “Their boat was almost in my lap. I thought, ‘Oh my God. I’m going to die.’ ”

Lallemand claimed the Coast Guard was slow to throw him a flotation device after he went overboard. Even after the crew members did, he said, he refused to get in the boat and tried in vain to swim to shore. When the crew finally pulled him aboard and handcuffed him, Lallemand said, they injured his arm and scraped his limbs on the deck, causing him to bleed.

The Coast Guard vessel towed the overturned aluminum boat to shore and handed Lallemand over to US Customs and Border Patrol agents, who held him for several hours in a cell at a nearby facility. A spokesperson for that agency said it returned Lallemand to Canada without filing criminal charges or levying a fine. The Coast Guard said it’s continuing to investigate Lallemand’s actions.

“He was really hurting,” said Miller, who saw his friend later that night. “He was at a loss for words. He couldn’t believe what happened.”

Lallemand is still seething. Though he lives mere miles from the border and used to frequent a bingo game on the Vermont side, he now expects to stay closer to home.

715,119,Former Superman Actor Doesn’t Like James Gunn Calling The Hero An Immigrant,https://kotaku.com/superman-movie-james-gunn-dean-cain-immigrant-1851786076,2025-07-10T20:20:00Z,Kotaku,US,illegal alien,"Once Superman, always Superman.

For a generation of kids too young to catch Christopher Reeve’s Superman run in the ’80s, ABC’s Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman served as their introduction to the invincible titan. That means Dean Cain was many people’s first exposure to a live-action Superman—and he’s not too happy with James Gunn’s recent comments about the hero being an immigrant.

Gunn recently told The Sunday Times that Superman’s story reflects the American experience, saying the son of Krypton is “an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country.” Well, that got Cain’s retired red trunks in a bunch. In a video interview with TMZ, Cain didn’t hold back his criticism, claiming that labeling the hero an immigrant will prove to be a misstep.

“I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it’s an immigrant thing, and I think it’s going to hurt the numbers on the movie. I was excited for the film. I am excited to see what it is… I’m rooting for it to be a success, but I don’t like that last political comment.”

Here’s Cain’s issue: he’s tired of Disney and Hollywood retrofitting legacy characters like Superman and Snow White with modern ideologies that, in his view, align with current political trends but strip those characters of their original, innocent essence. Put simply, he’s tired of his favorite characters becoming—wait for it—“woke.”

To Cain, Superman has always stood for “truth, justice, and the American way,” but only the American way of decades past—not the modern one, which he suggests is compromised by too much immigration.

“You can’t come in saying, ‘I want to get rid of all the rules in America because I want it to be more like Somalia.’ Well, that doesn’t work, because you had to leave Somalia to come here…There have to be limits, because we can’t have everybody in the United States. We can’t have everybody—society will fail. So there have to be limits.”

But Cain seems to be ignoring a few key facts. First, Superman is literally an alien, and U.S. immigration law considers anyone who isn’t a citizen or national of the United States an “alien.” In fact, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has an entire section dedicated to Alien Registration Requirements

Secondly, Smallville had an entire episode in which Clark Kent (Tom Welling) confronts his mother about her hypocritical stance—wanting to report an undocumented immigrant to authorities but not doing the same when Clark crash-landed on their farm. To leave nothing open to interpretation, Clark explicitly says, “I’m an illegal immigrant, Mom.”

At the end of the day, no matter how beloved a character may be, their identity is at the discretion of whoever owns their copyright. If one day Kevin Feige decides Iron Man should be a priest, or Thor an Indian bus driver, or Doctor Doom a pediatrician, then that’s what they’ll be.

716,50,Here’s the Clip When Dean Cain’s Superman Gets Busted for Being Illegal Alien,https://www.cracked.com/article_47427_heres-the-clip-when-dean-cains-superman-gets-busted-for-being-illegal-alien.html,2025-07-17T16:30:00Z,Cracked.com,US,illegal alien,"Dean Cain doesn’t think Superman is an immigrant story. Or does he?

Dean Cain’s showbiz career hasn’t leapt over tall buildings in a single bound since the end of Lois & Clark, the Superman TV show that made him a star. These days, you’re more likely to find him on Fox News or TMZ, sounding off on cultural and political issues. With the recent Superman movie in the news, Cain thrust himself back into the limelight, criticizing director James Gunn for saying that his Superman was an immigrant story.

An immigrant? Not on Cain’s watch. “How woke is Hollywood going to make this character?” Cain wondered aloud to TMZ. While America has traditionally welcomed immigrants, “there have to be limits, because we can’t have everybody in the United States. We can’t have everybody, society will fail.”

“I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it’s an immigrant thing, and I think it’s going to hurt the numbers on the movie,” Cain continued. “I’m rooting for it to be a success, but I don’t like that last political comment.”

Don't Miss

There were only three little problems with Cain’s diatribe.

1 Cain Hadn’t Seen the Movie “Changing beloved characters I don’t think is a great idea,” Cain griped. “If you want to create a new character, go ahead and do that.” How much did Gunn change Superman? Cain would have a hard time saying, considering he spouted off before actually watching the movie.

2 Superman Was Boffo at the Box Office Cain warned that Gunn’s comments about the Superman character would “hurt the numbers.” Oops. Superman flew past Warner Bros.’ estimates and took in $217 million in its opening weekend, the biggest start ever for the franchise. The opening was especially impressive during a time of superhero fatigue, with other DC and Marvel movies failing to live up to expectations. “I’m incredibly grateful for your enthusiasm and kind words over the past few days,” Gunn said while watching the cash pour in.

717,31,"'Superman' features a pocket universe, a tyrannical billionaire, and a flying dog. Confused? Here's the ending explained.",https://www.businessinsider.com/superman-ending-explained-pocket-universe-lex-luthor-flying-dog-supergirl-2025-7,2025-07-11T16:00:41Z,Business Insider,US,illegal alien,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

The new ""Superman,"" which reboots the DC Universe, throws audiences right into the action as the hero goes head to head with the villainous billionaire, Lex Luthor.

But its director James Gunn introduces so many new ideas (like Krypto the Superdog and an entire pocket universe) that the story could feel confusing for some viewers by the end of the film.

The story follows Clark Kent/Superman (David Corenswet) as he grapples with his place in the world, as Luthor (Nicholas Hoult) hatches a plot to discredit, imprison, and kill the Man of Steel.

At the same time, Luthor also schemes with the ruler of a fictional country called Boravia to overthrow a Middle Eastern nation called Jarhanpur. It's a busy film, but it shows the broad storylines Superman can fit into.

Here's the ending of ""Superman"" explained.

Lex Luthor imprisons Superman in his pocket universe.

Much of the story revolves around Luthor's plot to discredit Superman by using a stolen recording of his Kryptonian parents telling their son to conquer Earth to restart their destroyed planet, Krypton. Because of this, the US government allows Luthor, a villainous genius billionaire, to imprison Superman in his high-tech facility. It exists within a pocket universe that Luthor created.

After Superman is apprehended by a mysterious masked figure who works for Luthor, called Ultraman, he discovers that Luthor is using the prison to detain anyone who disagrees with his violent pursuit of the hero.

Luthor even blackmails a superpowered person called Rex (Anthony Carrigan), who can make any element from the periodic table, to weaken Superman with Kryptonite.

Superman eventually convinces Rex to use his powers to make a miniature Sun so that he can regain his strength and save Rex's baby son, Josh, from Luthor's henchmen. Once he's back to his usual cheery self, Superman frees himself, Rex, and Josh from the prison and escapes through a portal that the Justice Gang member Mr. Terrific (Edi Gathegi) and the journalist Lois Lane (Rachel Brosnahan) have managed to open.

Once he returns to Metropolis, it isn't long before Superman has to fight Ultraman. While their brawl rages through the city, Luthor chooses to let the portal to the pocket universe start spreading, eventually splitting Metropolis in half.

Superman fights Ultraman, and Mr. Terrific closes the portal to the pocket universe.

Ultraman is unmasked during the fight, and revealed to be a Superman clone that Luthor created by stealing Kent's DNA from previous fights he's had around the world. The clone cannot think or speak for itself, and Superman ends up throwing it into a black hole inside the pocket universe.

Superman confronts Luthor at his headquarters, and Mr. Terrific closes the portal to save the city. Meanwhile, Luthor berates Superman and tells him that he wants to destroy him because he envies the attention he gets, despite being an illegal alien from another planet.

Luthor feels that his intelligence should warrant more praise than Superman's strength. But the hero points out that he's just trying to be the best person he can be, and that he considers himself human because of his upbringing.

While all that is happening, Green Lantern (Nathan Fillion) and Hawkgirl (Isabela Merced) intervene in the Middle East to stop Boravia from invading Jarhanpur and committing genocide.

Lane uses the information she and the fellow journalist Jimmy Olsen (Skyler Gisondo) have collected about Luthor arming Boravia to publish an exposé about him. This leads the authorities to arrest him and restore the public's faith in Superman.

Later, while recovering from the fight, Superman watches footage from his childhood with his adopted parents in Kansas, showing that he considers them his true family.

However, that's not to say he completely rejects his Kryptonian heritage, because Supergirl (Milly Alcock) arrives at his base in the Arctic to collect Krypto the Superdog. This sets up the next DC Universe movie: ""Supergirl.""

""Superman"" has two fun, post-credits scenes.

Thanks to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, post-credits scenes have become an expectation in comic book movies, as fans wait to get a glimpse of what's ahead in the next movie or what kind of crossover the studio is building up to.

""Superman"" has two post-credits scenes, but they're fun instead of building up to another movie. In the first mid-credits scene, Superman sits with Krypto on the moon while they look at Earth.

Then, in the second, Superman meets up with Mr. Terrific in Metropolis as the work begins to rebuild the city.

Superman points out that the building isn't quite straight after the repair, and Mr. Terrific just walks away.

718,87,Those Fascist Social Media Posts by DHS Have a Copyright Problem,https://gizmodo.com/those-fascist-social-media-posts-by-dhs-have-a-copyright-problem-2000636302,2025-07-30T13:35:04Z,Gizmodo.com,US,illegal alien,"The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has spent recent months posting unhinged propaganda from ICE videos featuring Bible quotes to historic paintings about Manifest Destiny. Some of the images and videos posted to social media appear to use intellectual property for which DHS didn’t obtain the rights, including audio from the 2022 film The Batman. And now at least one rights holder is speaking up about it.

The estate of the late painter Thomas Kinkade, who died in 2012, has posted a statement to its website about the use of “Morning Pledge,” a painting the official DHS account posted earlier this month with the caption “Protect the Homeland.”

“On July 1st, the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) posted a photo on their social media accounts accompanied by a Thomas Kinkade Studios painting. The use of his artwork was unauthorized, and we have requested that DHS remove the post, and we are consulting with our counsel on our options,” the foundation wrote.

Protect the Homeland. “Morning Pledge” by Thomas Kinkade pic.twitter.com/JLs26R3VlO — Homeland Security (@DHSgov) July 1, 2025

The statement continued to say that the Kinkade Family Foundation strongly condemns the sentiment of the post as well as “the deplorable actions that DHS continues to carry out.” The sentiment, of course, is that America must return to a mythologized past that’s more white. At least that’s how commenters on X clearly saw it.

“Like many of you, we were deeply troubled to see this image used to promote division and xenophobia associated with the ideals of DHS, as this is antithetical to our mission,” the statement reads. “We stand firmly with our communities who have been threatened and targeted by DHS, especially our immigrant, BIPOC, undocumented, LGBTQ+, and disabled relatives and neighbors.”

The official DHS account has also recently shared a painting by Morgan Weistling with the caption “Remember your Homeland’s Heritage.” The account misidentifies the painting as being titled “New Life in a New Land,” though it’s actually called “A Prayer for a New Life.” Wiestling hasn’t publicly commented on the use of his image by DHS.

Another painting used recently is no longer protected by copyright, but is no less controversial for the message it sends. The work is called “American Progress” by John Gast and is frequently used in history books to demonstrate the concept of Manifest Destiny, the belief that some settlers had in the 19th century that they were destined by God to colonize the American West.

The tweet was given the caption, “A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending.” As an expert who spoke with the Washington Post notes, it presents a “sanitized version of U.S. history” that fails to recognize the wholesale destruction of Indigenous communities when settlers moved west during the 19th century. Gast himself was an immigrant, adding another layer of irony to the post.

A Heritage to be proud of, a Homeland worth Defending. American Progress – John Gast pic.twitter.com/agU6bl8TZ8 — Homeland Security (@DHSgov) July 23, 2025

But it’s the DHS social media videos that are arguably even more disturbing than the paintings. And they could get DHS into some copyright trouble.

One video posted on Monday includes the caption, “TO EVERY CRIMINAL ILLEGAL ALIEN IN AMERICA: Darkness is no longer your ally. You represent an existential threat to the citizens of the United States, and US Border Patrol’s Special Operations Group will stop at nothing to hunt you down.” And aside from the verbose language, the imagery is quite disturbing when you remember what ICE is now doing on a daily basis.

The video shows men in tactical gear storming what appears to be a training building. The video also uses a voiceover from The Batman (2022), in which we hear Robert Pattinson read the line “They think I’m hiding in the shadows. But I am the shadows.”

The video also uses a bible quote projected on screen, Proverbs 28:1, which reads “The wicked flee when no man pursueth; but the righteous are bold as a lion.” The use of the passage appears to be an attempt to suggest that immigrants are fleeing when nobody is coming for them, which obviously makes no sense. ICE has waged a campaign of rounding up migrants without any criminal record, and these people do have folks pursuing them. Folks who often won’t even show their face or prove that they work for law enforcement.

It’s also rather ironic that just two verses later, the book of Proverbs seems to denounce precisely what the Trump regime is doing: “A ruler who oppresses the poor is like a driving rain that leaves no crops.” And just a few verses beyond that: “Better the poor whose walk is blameless than the rich whose ways are perverse.”

Another video posted to social media platforms like Facebook again uses a bible verse, along with a voiceover that says, “And I heard the voice of the Lord saying: Who shall I send, and who will go for us? And I said: Here am I; send me.”

The video also features the song “God’s Gonna Cut You Down” by Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, featured in the Netflix series A Man in Full starring Jeff Daniels. It’s unclear whether DHS sought permission to use the song, but the version on Instagram currently reads, “This song is currently unavailable,” suggesting it was pulled due to copyright issues.

The Department of Homeland Security didn’t reply to Gizmodo’s questions about its fascist social media posts or its use of copyrighted material. We’ll update this article if we hear back, though the last time we interacted with ICE, an agency spokesperson sent us statistics that were clearly not grounded in reality. And when asked for proof of their claims about violence against ICE officers, they ignored those emails.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,

from the bunch-of-soulless-liars dept

For weeks, ICE and DHS have been claiming there’s been an outsized outbreak in violence against ICE officers. The government preferred to use a misleading stat: the percentage. That way it could claim assaults were up 500, 600, 790%(!!!) in successive press releases and Fox News appearances, leading many to believe being an ICE officer was perhaps the most dangerous job in America.

Unbelievably, it was Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin that finally revealed the actual numbers behind the panicky percentage claims. A 690% increase in assaults meant nothing more than this: ICE officers had been “assaulted” 69 more times since the beginning of this year as compared to the same six-month period last year.

Now, there’s even more bullshit to unpack. “Assault” means something else to law enforcement officers who want to claim they’ve been assaulted than it means to them when they’re filling out paperwork for assaults reported by citizens. According to ICE and other law enforcement officers, “assault” means anything from getting handed a beating to simply being inadvertently bumped when “interacting” with regular people while performing their public duties.

That’s exactly what happened in Ontario, California, when a masked officer claiming to be an ICE officer attempted to enter a private area of a private building — namely, the inner rooms of a surgery center. Employees of the surgery center demanded identification and a warrant — something well within their rights. In response, they got refusals and one employee got an ICE forearm to their throat.

Supposedly, there’s an assault in here but all I see is someone instinctively reacting to an assault by an ICE officer — one in which the employee did nothing more than place a hand on the officer’s arm in hopes of dissuading the officer from further assaulting their coworker:

DHS has arrested two medical personnel at a surgical center in California for demanding that the officers trespassing in their building identify themselves & provide a warrant, accusing them of another…. wait for it… ASSAULT. The case shows how DHS lies relentlessly to violate the Constitution — David Bier (@davidjbier.bsky.social) 2025-07-27T13:55:16.100Z

While the officer was probably salty that the staff managed to separate him from the person he had illegally entered private property to pursue, having someone stand between you and your illegal acts is not engaging in assault. Instead, it’s you — the federal officer — who is both ignoring the constitutional limits on your power as well as refusing to respect the protections extended to the people you actually serve: the general public.

Once this recording began circulating on social media, the Trump administration reacted like it always does: by piling lies on top of lies before scattering some criminal charges on top of its mountain of bullshit. David Bier’s thread on Bluesky unpacks all of it extremely well, but let’s hit some of the high points.

First, there’s the government’s bullshit, which was, of course, delivered by DHS head Kristi Noem’s second-in-command, Tricia McLaughlin:

In a statement to KTLA about Tuesday’s incident at the surgery center, DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said: “ICE officers conducted a targeted enforcement operation to arrest two illegal aliens. Officers in clearly marked ICE bulletproof vests approached the illegal alien targets as they exited a vehicle. One of the illegal aliens, Denis Guillen-Solis who is from Honduras, fled on foot to evade law enforcement. He ended up near the Ontario Advanced Surgical Center where hospital staff assaulted law enforcement and drug the officer and illegal alien into the facility. Then, the staff attempted to obstruct the arrest by locking the door, blocking law enforcement vehicles from moving, and even called the cops claiming there was a ‘kidnapping.’”

First off, it’s not “obstruction” to prevent someone from engaging in an illegal act, even if that person claims to be a federal officer. Even federal officers are not allowed to engage in warrantless searches of private areas not open to the general public.

As for “clearly marked ICE bulletproof vests,” don’t make me choke on my own bitter laughter. Anyone with a couple hundred dollars of equipment can crank out an embroidered patch at home that contains the same letter and then attach it to anything they’ve picked up from the local military surplus outlet. ID cards, badges, and warrants might be just as easy to fake, but that still doesn’t explain why this alleged officer refused to provide any of those things when asked to, as though all that was needed was an embroidered patch and the willingness to violate the Constitution.

There’s even more bullshit in this response, but those are the things that can be immediately gleaned from the officer’s actions, the surgical center employees’ response, and the DHS’s belated attempt to paper over a clearly illegal act one of its employees attempted to carry out.

The government is now pressing assault charges against two of the surgical center employees. That affidavit [PDF] directly contradicts the claims made by the soulless cretin currently employed as the assistant secretary of the DHS.

McLaughlin claimed this was a “targeted enforcement operation” seeking a known criminal. The charging documents say otherwise, as KTLA points out in its follow-up reporting:

According to an affidavit filed in the case, the confrontation began after two immigration officers conducting roving immigration enforcement operations in Ontario followed a truck carrying three adult men. The vehicle pulled into the parking lot of a local surgery center, and two of the men fled on foot when approached by agents.

There it is: ICE was just driving around looking for people who looked foreign and then sprung into action when the officers came across a few Hispanic-looking men. There’s nothing illegal about fleeing a non-consensual stop, but the ICE officer who followed the man into the surgical center apparently thought otherwise.

And that’s where the affidavit begins to fall apart. The government claims “exigent circumstances” (namely “hot pursuit”) completely nullified the Fourth Amendment. But the government is wrong. It doesn’t do that automatically in all cases and it especially doesn’t do it when the only suspected crime isn’t a violent offense. Fleeing from an officer isn’t always probable cause for further pursuit and/or arrest. Neither does looking sorta Mexican while doing it, as a federal court in California forcefully pointed out recently.

Even if you ignore those two factors, you’re left with the suspected “crime” of being in the country illegally, which is actually a civil law violation. And civil law violations don’t justify the abuse of warrant exceptions like “hot pursuit.”

The government probably won’t drop these charges because it’s too invested in pushing the narrative that ICE is beset on all sides by assailants. But it would be the smart thing to do because it’s going to have to explain why these officers chose to ignore the Constitution en route to being “assaulted” by people unwilling to be pushed around by thugs pretending to be interested in anything resembling actual law and order. And for the rest of us, we have another data point indicating that the exponential increase in “assaults” on ICE officers is likely just a whole lot of stuff like this where people are reacting normally to masked officers who choose to behave like rogue agents.

721,54,Leader of Illegal-Alien Smuggling Ring Sentenced to 10 Years,https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/07/15/leader-illegal-alien-smuggling-ring-sentenced/,2025-07-15T19:55:00Z,Daily Signal,US,illegal alien,"A Honduran national living in Texas and responsible for smuggling an estimated 2,500 to 3,000 illegal aliens into the U.S. has been sentenced for his crimes.

Over the course of three years, Enil Edil Mejia-Zuniga was a leader of a large illegal-immigrant smuggling ring, helping thousands of migrants enter the U.S. from 11 different countries, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

“Smuggling rings have no place in Texas. I am proud that San Antonio ICE arrested this illegal alien who smuggled thousands of illegal aliens into our homeland,” Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, told The Daily Signal. “Because of ICE, our streets are safer, and the integrity of our immigration system is upheld.”

On July 9, a federal judge sentenced Mejia-Zuniga to 10 years in prison followed by three years of supervised release after the Honduran national “pleaded guilty to three counts of bringing an alien to the U.S. for financial gain and aiding and abetting,” according to ICE.

Five other co-defendants in the case have either already been sentenced or are awaiting sentencing.

ICE’s Homeland Security Investigations Del Rio conducted the investigation with various federal and state law enforcement agencies in South Texas.

“Despite the doxing and the anti-ICE rhetoric from the radical open-borders crowd in this country, our brave immigration agents continue to do their job undeterred,” Roy said. “We thank them every single day for their hard work, and I commend all law enforcement in San Antonio for ending this smuggling ring.”

According to Matthew R. Galeotti, acting assistant attorney general, “Mejia-Zuniga and his co-conspirators made millions of dollars off the backs of thousands of people whom they smuggled into the United States.”

According to the Justice Department, Mejia-Zuniga operated the smuggling ring from November 2020 through March 2023. Illegal aliens from numerous countries, including Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, India, and Pakistan, worked primarily with a Pakistani smuggler based in Brazil to arrange travel. Then the Pakistani smuggler worked with Mejia-Zuniga, who was based in San Antonio, Texas, to get the illegal aliens from South America into the U.S. The DOJ reports that Mejia-Zuniga ran the operations side of the smuggling ring—paying drivers and arming smuggler “coyotes.”

The illegal aliens were charged between $6,500 to $12,000, according to the DOJ, and “Mejia-Zuniga admitted that he made $30,000 for every 10 illegal aliens who made it to the Rio Grande and another $30,000 if those 10 illegal aliens made it to San Antonio.”

The investigation into the smuggling operation produced evidence of “wire transfers, customer ledgers, foreign identification documents, and photographs of members of the Mejia-Zuniga [alien-smuggling organization] with firearms,” according to the DOJ.

“In an effort to satisfy his greed, Mejia-Zuniga facilitated the illegal movement of thousands of Middle Easterners into the United States,” Justin Simmons, U.S. attorney for the Western District of Texas, said. “His actions put our national security at risk. However, thanks to our many federal law enforcement partners, Mejia-Zuniga will no longer be allowed to enrich himself to the detriment of this country.”",NewsAPI,17.1,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Problematic,20.15,"The Daily Signal, dailysignal.com",not found,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-signal,,,,,,,,Right,,,4,,,Unknown,Unknown,Right,Right,Right,dailysignal.com,,daily signal,44,USA,,,,
477,259,Trump announces expansion of ICE raids in sanctuary cities,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/white-house/3442546/trump-announces-expansion-ice-raids-sanctuary-cities/,2025-06-16T03:12:04Z,Washington Examiner,US,mass migration,"President Donald Trump announced an expansion of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement raids on sanctuary cities as part of his campaign promise of the “largest Mass Deportation Program in History.”

Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post on Sunday night, where he called on ICE officers to “reverse the tide of Mass Destruction Migration” by targeting cities at the “core of the Democrat Power Center,” citing the three largest cities in the country: New York City, Los Angeles, and Chicago.

“We must expand efforts to detain and deport Illegal Aliens in America’s largest Cities, such as Los Angeles, Chicago, and New York, where Millions upon Millions of Illegal Aliens reside. These, and other such Cities, are the core of the Democrat Power Center, where they use Illegal Aliens to expand their Voter Base, cheat in Elections, and grow the Welfare State, robbing good paying Jobs and Benefits from Hardworking American Citizens. These Radical Left Democrats are sick of mind, hate our Country, and actually want to destroy our Inner Cities — And they are doing a good job of it!” the president posted.

Trump added that the expanded deportation efforts would be focused on “our crime ridden and deadly Inner Cities, and those places where Sanctuary Cities play such a big role.”

“The American People want our Cities, Schools, and Communities to be SAFE and FREE from Illegal Alien Crime, Conflict, and Chaos. That’s why I have directed my entire Administration to put every resource possible behind this effort, and reverse the tide of Mass Destruction Migration that has turned once Idyllic Towns into scenes of Third World Dystopia. Our Federal Government will continue to be focused on the REMIGRATION of Aliens to the places from where they came, and preventing the admission of ANYONE who undermines the domestic tranquility of the United States,” Trump said.

Trump’s focus on sanctuary cities for his deportation operation follows violent anti-ICE riots that rocked Los Angeles over the past week.

The president’s decision to deploy the National Guard and, later, the Marines to the city to quell the chaos was condemned by the Democratic leaders of the state, specifically Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-CA) and Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass.

Newsom and Bass have maintained that state law enforcement is sufficient in dealing with the riots and view the National Guard deployment as only inflaming the violence.

Trump, however, saw it as a necessary enforcement step to take after rioters were seen attacking law enforcement with stones, concrete, Molotov cocktails, and fireworks.

Newsom later sued the Trump administration over the deployment, with a judge ruling last week that Trump must return the National Guard authority to California. An appeals court temporarily blocked that ruling early Friday.

Other sanctuary city governors have taunted the Trump administration over immigration enforcement.

At a congressional hearing on Thursday, Govs. J.B. Pritzker (D-IL) and Kathy Hochul (D-NY) both said Trump’s border czar, Tom Homan, could “arrest” them.

478,259,Not all immigration is equal,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/restoring-america/patriotism-unity/3403836/not-all-mass-immigration-is-equal/,2025-05-08T17:00:00Z,Washington Examiner,US,mass migration,"In an age where information is abundant but wisdom is scarce, the national conversation around immigration has been overwhelmed by selective storytelling and misleading narratives. Too often, we are told that all immigration is the same — that every migrant is an asylum-seeker coming to the United States to seek a better life, all immigration benefits the country, and concern over border security and simply enforcing our laws equates to being anti-immigrant.

These partisan talking points disregard the full picture and cherry-pick information to back up their claims, which are designed to appeal to our emotions. The media, the Left, and academia have been spinning a web of lies on legal immigration for decades — from “diversity is our strength” to “our country was built by immigrants” — to obfuscate the core truth that unfettered mass migration has leveled disastrous consequences all over the world.

Let us start with a fundamental but critical distinction: not all immigration is equal. The difference between legal and illegal immigration is not semantic but foundational. Legal immigration, when properly done, is structured, vetted, and accountable. It lets us know who is entering our country, what their purpose is, and how they might contribute to our society. Illegal immigration, in contrast, circumvents the law, bypasses national security vetting, and leaves our communities vulnerable.

Consider this example: just this past March, the Associated Press ran an article titled ‘Trump administration deports hundreds of immigrants even as a judge orders their removals be stopped,’ purposefully and willfully conflating legal immigration with criminal illegal aliens. These lies must stop.

This isn’t about demonizing those who cross the border illegally. It’s about defending the integrity of our immigration system and the safety of citizens, so we no longer live in oblivion. Ignorance is not bliss, but costly and deadly.

The prevailing narrative that most illegal aliens are simply seeking a better life is not supported by facts. In fiscal 2024, the Customs and Border Protection arrested 15,267 criminal aliens involved in crimes, including drug trafficking, sexual assault, and homicide. This is just the number of criminal aliens detained by Border Patrol. This number does not include those apprehended by other agencies or states, nor does it account for those roaming free in our streets. Criminal organizations, including cartels, thrive in the chaos of open borders. We cannot afford to be naïve about this reality.

The most pervasive lie spun by the globalist open borders crowd is that immigration, even illegal, strengthens the economy. The truth is, not only do we suffer a threat to our security and safety, but there is also a serious financial cost brought on by illegal immigration. The border crisis placed an extraordinary burden on taxpayers, ranging from an estimated $150 billion to $400 billion. These funds are not theoretical. They are your tax dollars for improving communities, investing in public safety, and responding to national disasters. State and local governments, from urban liberal bastions such as New York City to small border towns such as Brownsville, Texas, were placed under immense strain from the border crisis. Ignoring these facts will never make them disappear.

Just look at what happened when Hurricane Helene devastated communities across Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and Tennessee. As these states struggled to recover, Federal Emergency Management Agency resources were already strained because the agency had spent $1.4 billion on services for illegal immigrants. This included hotel accommodations, food, and shelter — all while citizens in disaster zones waited for lifesaving assistance. This is not compassion — it is misplaced priorities.

BECOMING AN AMERICAN: HOW TO FIX THE LEGAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM

Still, many insist all immigration yields a net positive. But again, legal and illegal immigration are not the same. Lawful immigration, done right, can benefit our country. Illegal immigration, however, encourages breaking the law, fuels trafficking networks, and diverts critical resources from American communities. That is not a strength, it’s a liability.

We must confront the misinformation clouding this debate. We can no longer allow false narratives to shape the future of our immigration system. It is time to reject the emotional manipulation and misinformation that have muddled this debate. Putting America First means upholding the rule of law, protecting our communities, and ensuring immigration strengthens, not weakens, our great nation.

They arrive at the U.S. border from around the world: Eritrea, Guatemala, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Ghana, Uzbekistan and so many other countries.

They come for asylum, insisting they face persecution for their religion, or sexuality or for supporting the wrong politicians.

For generations, they had been given the chance to make their case to U.S. authorities.

Not anymore.

“They didn’t give us an ICE officer to talk to. They didn’t give us an interview. No one asked me what happened,” said a Russian election worker who sought asylum in the U.S. after he said he was caught with video recordings he made of vote rigging. On Feb. 26, he was deported to Costa Rica with his wife and young son.

On Jan. 20, just after being sworn in for a second term, President Donald Trump suspended the asylum system as part of his wide-ranging crackdown on illegal immigration, issuing a series of executive orders designed to stop what he called the “invasion” of the United States.

What asylum-seekers now find, according to lawyers, activists and immigrants, is a murky, ever-changing situation with few obvious rules, where people can be deported to countries they know nothing about after fleeting conversations with immigration officials while others languish in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody.

Attorneys who work frequently with asylum-seekers at the border say their phones have gone quiet since Trump took office. They suspect many who cross are immediately expelled without a chance at asylum or are detained to wait for screening under the U.N.’s convention against torture, which is harder to qualify for than asylum.

“I don’t think it’s completely clear to anyone what happens when people show up and ask for asylum,” said Bella Mosselmans, director of the Global Strategic Litigation Council.

Restrictions face challenges in court

A thicket of lawsuits, appeals and countersuits have filled the courts as the Trump administration faces off against activists who argue the sweeping restrictions illegally put people fleeing persecution in harm’s way.

In a key legal battle, a federal judge is expected to rule on whether courts can review the administration’s use of invasion claims to justify suspending asylum. There is no date set for that ruling.

The government says its declaration of an invasion is not subject to judicial oversight, at one point calling it “an unreviewable political question.”

But rights groups fighting the asylum proclamation, led by the American Civil Liberties Union, called it “as unlawful as it is unprecedented” in the complaint filed in a Washington, D.C., federal court.

Illegal border crossings, which soared in the first years of President Joe Biden’s administration, reaching nearly 10,000 arrests per day in late 2023, dropped significantly during his last year in office and plunged further after Trump returned to the White House.

Yet more than 200 people are still arrested daily for illegally crossing the southern U.S. border.

Some of those people are seeking asylum, though it's unclear if anyone knows how many.

Paulina Reyes-Perrariz, managing attorney for the San Diego office of the Immigrant Defenders Law Center, said her office sometimes received 10 to 15 calls a day about asylum after Biden implemented asylum restrictions in 2024.

That number has dropped to almost nothing, with only a handful of total calls since Jan. 20.

Plus, she added, lawyers are unsure how to handle asylum cases.

“It’s really difficult to consult and advise with individuals when we don’t know what the process is,” she said.

Doing ‘everything right’

None of this was expected by the Russian man, who asked not to be identified for fear of persecution if he returns to Russia.

“We felt betrayed,” the 36-year-old told The Associated Press. “We did everything right.”

The family had scrupulously followed the rules. They traveled to Mexico in May 2024, found a cheap place to rent near the border with California and waited nearly nine months for the chance to schedule an asylum interview.

On Jan. 14, they got word that their interview would be on Feb 2. On Jan. 20, the interview was canceled.

Moments after Trump took office, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced it had scrubbed the system used to schedule asylum interviews and canceled tens of thousands of existing appointments.

There was no way to appeal.

The Russian family went to a San Diego border crossing to ask for asylum, where they were taken into custody, he said.

A few weeks later, they were among the immigrants who were handcuffed, shackled and flown to Costa Rica. Only the children were left unchained.

Turning to other countries to hold deportees

The Trump administration has tried to accelerate deportations by turning countries like Costa Rica and Panama into “bridges,” temporarily detaining deportees while they await return to their countries of origin or third countries.

Earlier this year, some 200 migrants were deported from the U.S. to Costa Rica and roughly 300 were sent to Panama.

To supporters of tighter immigration controls, the asylum system has always been rife with exaggerated claims by people not facing real dangers. In recent years, roughly one-third to half of asylum applications were approved by judges.

Even some politicians who see themselves as pro-immigration say the system faces too much abuse.

“People around the world have learned they can claim asylum and remain in the U.S. indefinitely to pursue their claims,” retired U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, a longtime Democratic stalwart in Congress, wrote last year in the Wall Street Journal, defending Biden’s tightening of asylum policies amid a flood of illegal immigration.

An uncertain future

Many of the immigrants they arrived with have left the Costa Rican facility where they were first detained, but the Russian family has stayed. The man cannot imagine going back to Russia and has nowhere else to go.

He and his wife spend their days teaching Russian and a little English to their son. He organizes volleyball games to keep people busy.

He is not angry at the U.S. He understands the administration wanting to crack down on illegal immigration. But, he adds, he is in real danger. He followed the rules and can’t understand why he didn’t get a chance to plead his case.

He fights despair almost constantly, knowing that what he did in Russia brought his family to this place.

“I failed them,” he said. “I think that every day: I failed them.”

These arrests took place as part of an operation that spanned from June 6 to June 11, 2025.

“Under Tim Walz’s leadership, these depraved individuals have been walking freely around Minneapolis with impunity terrorizing American children,” DHS wrote in the press release.

Several Laotian criminal illegal aliens are listed in the press release. Pao Angelo Vang, arrested by ICE on June 6, has been convicted of 2nd degree sexual assault of a child, as has Thong Lao, who was arrested the same day.

Va Vang, also a Laotian criminal illegal alien, has been convicted of 1st degree sexual assault, while Xiong Pao Vang has been convicted of lewd or lascivious acts with a child under 14. Both were arrested by ICE on June 6.

That same day, ICE arrested Yia Xiong, convicted of 3rd degree criminal sexual conduct. Days later, ICE arrested Pok Vue, convicted of 4th degree criminal sexual conduct.

Other Laotian illegal aliens arrested by ICE were convicted of 1st, 2nd, and 3rd degree sexual conduct.

Tou Pao Lee, a Thai illegal alien arrested by ICE as part of these operations, has been convicted of soliciting a minor, while Yee Shae, another Thai illegal alien, was convicted of sexual abuse of a minor.

“These pedophiles and sex offenders are the sickos our brave ICE law enforcement are putting their lives on the line to arrest and remove from American communities,” said DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, criticizing Democrat Gov. Tim Walz for embracing sanctuary policies that have allowed these criminals to roam free.

“Instead of comparing ICE to the Nazi-Gestapo, Governor Walz should be thanking our law enforcement for removing these pedophiles from Minnesota,” she added.

Other ICE arrests across the country have included criminals convicted of homicide, sexual assault, drug trafficking, aggravated assault, and much more.

According to prosecutors, the woman is a Chinese national who traveled from New York to Texas to take a masseuse job. When she arrived in Texas, however, the woman stated that her passport had been taken from her and she was brought to Carcamo-Perdomo’s trailer, where she was locked up in a closet for five days without any food or water.

The woman alleges that Carcamo-Perdomo repeatedly raped her and beat her while holding her in captivity. One day, while the gate to Carcamo-Perdomo’s residence was left open, she escaped and started running down the street screaming for help. That’s when Carcamo-Perdomo can be seen on camera footage taking off after her and dragging her back to his trailer.

Police were called after the incident and searched Carcamo-Perdomo’s trailer, finding the woman locked away in the closet.

Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials say Carcamo-Perdomo was a beneficiary of the agency’s prior “prosecutorial discretion” policy that was implemented by the Biden administration and under the leadership of former Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas.

“This accused kidnapper and suspected sex trafficker was just one of the countless criminal illegal aliens who inexplicably had their removal proceedings terminated by the Biden administration and were allowed to remain in the country,” DHS’s Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

In November 2020, Carcamo-Perdomo crossed the United States-Mexico border and was placed in deportation proceedings. Later, the Biden administration asked an immigration judge to use prosecutorial discretion with Carcamo-Perdomo’s deportation case, which led to the judge terminating deportation proceedings against the illegal alien in September 2023.

“Thanks to the leadership of President Trump and Secretary Noem, criminal illegal aliens are being locked up and will no longer be allowed to terrorize American communities,” McLaughlin said. “Our message is clear: criminals are not welcome in the United States.”

A day after his arrest, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) lodged a detainer against Carcamo-Perdomo, so that if he is released from the Harris County Jail at any time, he will be turned over to agents for arrest and deportation.

Murad Sanih Awad, an illegal alien from Jordan, was arrested by ICE agents in Atlanta, Georgia, after having been convicted 40 times on criminal charges — including child sexual abuse, organized drug trafficking, and conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government.

“Awad is yet another egregious example of what happens when open border policies are paired with spineless leadership,” the Department of Homeland Security’s Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement:

Awad was allowed to terrorize American communities and accumulate 40 criminal convictions, including sexual battery, without consequence. The Biden era of negligence is over. Under President Trump and Secretary Noem, we are restoring law and order and ensuring dangerous criminal aliens are removed before they can harm more innocent Americans. [Emphasis added]

Also arrested by ICE agents recently is Niceforo Ruiz-Najera, an illegal alien from Mexico, who was previously convicted in Shelbyville, Tennessee, for facilitation of aggravated sexual battery of a 4-year-old child.

Ismael Galvan-Perez, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested by ICE agents after having been convicted of drug trafficking in Salt Lake City, Utah. And Abdul Waris Akinsanya, an illegal alien from Nigeria, was arrested after being convicted of forgery, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, and fleeing in a vehicle in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

ICE agents similarly arrested Victor Manuel Villalobos-Romero, an illegal alien from Mexico, who has been convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute methamphetamine in Florida.

Phil Murphy (D) was issued a subpoena over comments he made in February, implying that he was sheltering an illegal alien in his home, according to a New York Times report.

Several people “with knowledge of the matter” told the outlet that U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Alina Habba was “pursuing an investigation” into Murphy’s comments.

Two of the sources clarified that Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) agents had “sought to interview at least four witnesses in connection with the comments,” while another person stated that Murphy “had been subpoenaed”:

Mr. Murphy said in February that he was prepared to house a woman who immigration status was unclear at his family’s home in Middletown. F.B.I. agents have since sought to interview at least four witnesses in connection with the comments, two of the people said, with one adding that the governor had been subpoenaed but not questioned.

Breitbart News reported that during a discussion with Blue Wave New Jersey, Murphy indicated there was someone in the “broader universe” of his life “whose immigration status” was not at the point that they were trying to reach:

“Tammy and I were talking about … I don’t want to get into too much detail, but there’s someone in our broader universe whose immigration status is not yet at the point that they are trying to get it to,” Murphy said. “And, we said, ‘You know what? Let’s have her live at our house above our garage,’ and good luck to the feds coming in to try to get her.”

In the aftermath of Murphy’s comments, a representative for Murphy attempted to walk back the comments, telling the New York Post that nobody had “ever lived in the home” under those circumstances.",NewsAPI,13.55,,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Mixed,31.01,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/,https://ground.news/interest/breitbart,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/breitbart,RIGHT (8.1),MIXED (6.4),USA,,Website,High Traffic,LOW CREDIBILITY,Right,Breitbart News Network LLC,2007,6,Right,Mixed,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,breitbart.com,,breitbart news,41,USA,Y,H,Breitbart,

On Thursday, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced federal charges against Bass Ndiaye, an illegal alien from Senegal, for allegedly assaulting an ICE agent and other detainees with a deadly weapon.

On July 17, ICE agents arrested Ndiaye and took him to an immigration processing center in New York City, New York. The following day, while awaiting processing, Ndiaye allegedly grabbed a pair of scissors and tried to stab an ICE agent.

With the scissors, Ndiaye also allegedly tried to stab other immigration detainees. ICE agents stepped in and grabbed the scissors, saving the other detainees from being wounded.

“ICE arrested Bass Ndiaye, an illegal alien from Senegal, who attempted to stab law enforcement officers and more than a dozen other detainees,” the Department of Homeland Security’s Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement:

This criminal illegal alien who was released into the country under President Biden will face justice for his violent crimes. Our ICE law enforcement is facing an 830% increase in assaults against them. Secretary Noem stands with the brave men and women of law enforcement as they risk their lives to remove criminal illegal aliens and protect Americans. [Emphasis added]

In October 2023, Ndiaye was arrested by Border Patrol agents at the United States-Mexico border and subsequently released into the U.S. interior under former DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’s leadership.

For the alleged assault, Ndiaye faces up to 20 years in federal prison.

President Trump and Secretary Noem unleashed ICE to arrest these criminal illegal aliens. From pedophiles to drug traffickers, ICE is prioritizing arresting the worst of the worst. We will not allow criminal illegals to terrorize American communities. [Emphasis added]

In particular, ICE agents arrested illegal alien Hector Bonaparte-Contreras of Mexico, who was previously convicted of predatory criminal sexual assault of a victim under the age of 13 in the sanctuary city of Chicago, Illinois.

Santiago Geovany Garcia-Rosales, an illegal alien from Guatemala, was also arrested by ICE agents after he had been convicted of failure to stop and render aid involving death in Harris County, Texas.

ICE agents similarly arrested illegal aliens Arnauld Sammy Kamana of Rwanda and Sergio Bermudez-Perez of Mexico. Kamana was convicted of theft in Moraine, Ohio, while Bermudez-Perez was convicted of felony larceny as well as breaking and entering in Harnett County, North Carolina.

Julio Armando Gomez-Fernandez, an illegal alien from Mexico, was arrested by ICE agents after he had been convicted of conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute more than 500 grams of methamphetamine. Gomez Fernandez was also previously convicted of illegal re-entry in Washington, DC.

Noelia A. Martinez, a 30-year-old illegal alien with a history of drunk driving, has been arrested and charged with second-degree homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle, second-degree homicide by intoxicated use of a vehicle with prohibited alcohol concentration, drunk driving, and knowingly operating a vehicle on a revoked license, among other charges.

On July 20, Martinez was allegedly drunk driving when she crashed into Hallie and Brady, who were in Brady’s Volkswagen Tiguan.

When first responders arrived on the scene, Hallie was unresponsive and was pronounced dead two hours later. Brady, suffering serious injuries, had to be airlifted to a nearby hospital.

Hallie’s Instagram shows that she and Brady had just attended senior prom about 11 weeks prior to the crash that killed her. Hallie’s last post was a video montage of her and Brady, with the caption “three years of us.”

Meanwhile, open beer cans were found by first responders in Martinez’s Chevy Suburban, and police officers said they smelled alcohol on her and that she failed a field sobriety test. At the time of the crash, Martinez had a blood-alcohol level of 0.208% — more than double the legal limit of 0.08%.

Though she initially denied being drunk, Martinez later admitted to police that she had consumed at least two Modelo beers.

While living illegally in the United States, Martinez has racked up several traffic violations and a conviction in November 2020 for drunk driving.

At the time of the crash, Martinez was supposed to have a device in her vehicle that prevented her from starting her car if she had been drinking. Additionally, her license had been revoked before the crash.

It is unclear why Martinez was never turned over to the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agency following her prior run-ins with the law. She is being held on a $250,000 bond.

Gildardo Amandor-Martinez, a 36-year-old illegal alien from Mexico, has been arrested by the Morehead Police Department and charged with murdering 15-year-old Luis Lopez, assaulting the boy’s 3-year-old sister, Naomi Agrical Nunez, and attempting to rape the boy’s mother, Aleida Lopez.

According to police, Amandor-Martinez — who had been in a relationship with Aleida Lopez — arrived at the family’s apartment and sought to have sex with the woman. When she refused, he attempted to rape her, according to police, and bit her several times.

Luis Lopez reportedly entered the room where Amandor-Martinez was allegedly trying to rape his mother and asked if she wanted him to call the police. Eventually, police say Amandor-Martinez fired three bullets into a room where he knew Luis Lopez was, killing him instantly.

Luis Lopez, who was about to begin his sophomore year at Rowan County Senior High School was known as a “sweet child who worked hard to do his best everyday at school,” school officials wrote in a Facebook post.

“Fifteen-year-old Luis Lopez died trying to save his mother from this criminal illegal alien who was attempting to rape her,” DHS’s Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement:

Gildardo Amandor-Martinez is a rapist and cold-blooded killer who should have never been in this country. The Biden administration’s open-border policies allowed this monster to walk American streets and commit these evil crimes, including murder, assault, and attempted rape, against a mother and her children. ICE has placed an arrest detainer to ensure Amandor-Martinez will not be released onto America’s streets and allowed to terrorize American families again. [Emphasis added]

DHS officials confirmed this week that Amandor-Martinez had tried to illegally cross the southern border three times in 2021. Sometime after his third attempt, he successfully crossed as an unknown “got-away,” undetected by Border Patrol agents.

Amandor-Martinez remains in Morehead police custody.

735,27,Sheriff Defends Sanctuary Policy After Illegal is Accused of Killing High School Sweethearts,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/07/29/wisconsin-sheriff-defends-sanctuary-policy-after-illegal-alien-accused-killing-high-school-sweethearts/,2025-07-29T20:01:04Z,Breitbart News,US,illegal alien,"Dane County, Wisconsin, Sheriff Kalvin Barrett is defending the county’s sanctuary policy that shields illegal aliens from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) just days after high school sweethearts 18-year-old Hallie Helgeson and 19-year-old Brady Heiling were killed in a crash allegedly caused by an illegal alien with a criminal record.

As Breitbart News reported, on July 20, illegal alien Noelia A. Martinez of Honduras, 30 years old, was allegedly drunk driving in Dane County when she crashed into Hallie and Brady.

Hallie was killed immediately and pronounced dead at the scene, while Brady was left in critical condition, airlifted to a nearby hospital, and died from his injuries on July 25. Hallie and Brady were high school sweethearts and had recently attended senior prom together.

Martinez, as Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials have since noted, should never have been in the United States and was able to hide from federal immigration enforcement partly due to Dane County’s sanctuary policy, which refuses to honor ICE detainers. These detainers are requests for custody whenever an illegal alien is released from local custody.

“Hallie Helgeson and Brady Heiling had their whole lives ahead of them — and they would still be alive today if it weren’t for Noelia Saray Martinez-Avila — a criminal illegal alien from Honduras,” DHS’s Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement.

McLaughlin continued:

Martinez-Avila recklessly drove the wrong way on a highway while intoxicated and killed these two teens. ICE has lodged an arrest detainer to remove this public safety threat from the U.S. Unfortunately, this sanctuary jurisdiction has a history of not honoring ICE arrest detainers often leading to the release of murderers and other heinous criminals. Under Secretary Noem, these precious victims will not be forgotten, and we will fight for justice. [Emphasis added]

Barrett, who told local media in February that he would not honor ICE detainers, is continuing to defend Dane County’s sanctuary policy even after Hallie’s and Brady’s deaths, according to a report from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel:

After her arrest, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement asked the Dane County Jail to hold her if she were to post bond so that ICE officers could take her into custody, making her vulnerable to deportation before her case concludes. Martinez-Avila is an undocumented immigrant from Honduras, according to the department. [Emphasis added] … Barrett said it is the Department of Homeland Security’s responsibility to obtain an arrest warrant signed by a judge, which would ensure that the department can lawfully take custody of Martinez-Avila. Detainers are not legally binding. [Emphasis added]

Barrett’s insistence on ICE securing an arrest warrant for Martinez is a tactic used by many sanctuary sheriffs.

ICE, under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), is not required to obtain criminal warrants from judges for suspected illegal aliens. Instead, ICE agents obtain administrative warrants that are signed off on by federal officials.

Sanctuary counties like Dane County often deploy the tactic anyway, claiming that they are not obstructing ICE agents from enforcing federal immigration law, but merely asking them to get a criminal warrant on an illegal alien, knowing such warrants are not required by federal law.

Martinez remains in Dane County custody, facing two counts of vehicular homicide. Her next hearing in the case is scheduled for September 22.

The judge also fined the Honduran national $4,500.

The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Texas charged Enil Edil Mejia-Zuniga, a 34-year-old Honduran national, with smuggling thousands of illegal aliens into the U.S. for financial gain. Officials say the defendant and his co-conspirators made millions of dollars by smuggling nearly 3,000 illegal aliens into the United States. The smuggling incidents took place between November 2020 and March 2023.

“The Mejia-Zuniga alien smuggling organization (ASO) smuggled aliens from Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, India, Pakistan, and Colombia, through Eagle Pass, Texas,” prosecutors stated. “Aliens primarily contracted with a Pakistani smuggler based in Brazil to be transported to the United States. In turn, the Brazilian-based smuggler worked with Mejia-Zuniga, who was based in San Antonio, Texas, to facilitate the travel of the aliens from South America to the United States. Mejia-Zuniga directed operations of the ASO and paid drivers, armed ‘coyotes,’ and stash house operators.”

Officials say the organization charged between $6,500 and $12,000 per person to bring them illegally into the United States. Mejia-Zuniga admitted to being paid $30,000 for every ten illegal aliens he smuggled through Mexico to the Rio Grande and an additional $30,000 for every ten that made it to San Antonio.

The statement from the U.S. Attorney adds:

One of the smuggled aliens reported paying the organization $20,000 to be brought illegally into the United States along with his brother. The Mejia-Zuniga ASO directed that alien to a stash house in Monterrey, Mexico, where it housed him with 10 other aliens. The ASO later moved the same alien to a stash house in Piedras Negras, Mexico, with another 20 to 25 aliens. Ultimately, an armed coyote guided the group of aliens across the Rio Grande River. Once across the Rio Grande, the Mejia-Zuniga ASO transported the aliens to a hotel in San Antonio.

Mejia-Zuniga pleaded guilty to three counts of aiding and abetting and bringing an alien to the United States. For that, the judge sentenced him to ten years in federal prison and a fine of $4,500. As he is an illegal alien from Honduras, he will likely be deported upon his release from prison.

Officials stated:

“In an effort to satisfy his greed, Mejia-Zuniga facilitated the illegal movement of thousands of Middle Easterners into the United States,” said U.S. Attorney Justin R. Simmons for the Western District of Texas. “His actions put our national security at risk. However, thanks to our many federal law enforcement partners, Mejia-Zuniga will no longer be allowed to enrich himself to the detriment of this country.” “This sentence sends a clear message to those who exploit our immigration system for personal profit,” said Special Agent in Charge Craig Larrabee of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) San Antonio. “For more than three years, these individuals operated a transnational smuggling ring driven by greed, moving illegal aliens from 11 countries in blatant disregard of the law. The sentencing in this case is a testament to HSI’s commitment to upholding national security. Human smuggling undermines the security of our borders and disrupts lawful immigration processes. HSI will continue to work tirelessly to protect our national security.” “United States Border Patrol’s (USBP) Intelligence and Information Task Force played a critical role in supporting Operation Red Tide through extensive research and analysis,” said Scott Good, Chief of USBP Law Enforcement Operations Directorate. “Our team’s exploitation of subpoena returns and identification of key financial patterns helped bring these smugglers to justice. The USBP will continue working with law enforcement agencies at home and abroad to dismantle criminal networks and secure our nation’s borders.”

The DOJ reported the following regarding Mejia-Zuniga’s co-defendants:

Co-defendants Monica Hernandez-Palma, 33, of Mexico, and Allyson Elsires Alvarez-Zuniga, 26, of Honduras, entered guilty pleas on April 7, 2025, and Aug. 21, 2023, respectively, and are awaiting sentencing. Co-defendant Genyi Arguenta-Flores, 32, of Comayagua, Honduras was sentenced to five years in prison on May 12. A final co-defendant is in custody in Mexico pending an extradition request from the United States.

The arrests are part of Operation Red Tide and Operation Take Back America.

739,27,Illegal Alien to Serve 90 Days in Prison for Chasing U.S. Attorney with Knife,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/07/09/previously-deported-illegal-alien-to-serve-90-days-in-prison-for-chasing-u-s-attorney-with-knife/,2025-07-09T20:02:25Z,Breitbart News,US,illegal alien,"An illegal alien, previously deported from the United States, will serve just 90 days in prison for chasing and threatening the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of New York, John A. Sarcone III, with a knife in the sanctuary state of New York.

Saul Morales-Garcia, a 40-year-old previously deported illegal alien from El Salvador, had been charged last month with second-degree attempted murder in Albany County, New York, after he allegedly approached Sarcone as he was leaving a hotel and threatened him with a knife.

Sarcone backed away from the illegal alien, police say, and made his way back inside the hotel as Morales-Garcia shouted at him in Spanish, wielding the knife.

Since then, Morales-Garcia was offered a plea deal, which he accepted — ensuring that he will serve only 90 days in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree menacing. Morales-Garcia, as part of the plea deal, will be ordered to stay away from Sarcone.

The Albany County District Attorney’s Office dropped the attempted murder charges against Morales-Garcia because they say surveillance footage did not meet the legal standard to charge the illegal alien with such a crime, a move that Sarcone supported.

According to reports, the illegal alien was homeless and living under bridges across Albany County after he rode his bike from Georgia to the sanctuary state.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials have lodged a detainer against Morales-Garcia, hoping to get custody of the illegal alien despite New York’s sanctuary state policy.

In 2009, Morales-Garcia was convicted of misdemeanor petit larceny in Arlington, Virginia. He was arrested by ICE agents the following year after having been in Arlington County jail on theft charges.

At the time, a federal immigration judge ordered him removed, and he was subsequently deported from the U.S. by ICE agents.

Sometime after he was deported to El Salvador in December 2021, Morales-Garcia illegally crossed the southern border again and was charged in Monroe County, Georgia, with drunk driving.

In 2023, Morales-Garcia was arrested by U.S. Parks Police and charged with disorderly conduct for threatening pedestrians, being drunk in public, and possessing an open container of alcohol. The following year, Morales-Garcia was charged in Upper Marion, Pennsylvania, with misdemeanor retail theft.

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is seeking a criminal complaint against Morales-Garcia for illegally re-entering the U.S. after he was deported.

740,27,TRUMP: Biden-Released Illegal Alien ‘Monster’ Shot Border Patrol Agent in Face During NY Robbery,https://www.breitbart.com/border/2025/07/20/trump-biden-released-illegal-alien-monster-shot-border-patrol-agent-in-face-during-ny-robbery/,2025-07-20T20:51:33Z,Breitbart News,US,illegal alien,"An illegal alien released by the Biden administration allegedly shot an off-duty Border Patrol agent in the face during an attempted robbery in New York City. Despite being shot twice, the agent managed to return fire, wounding the suspect as he fled on a moped.

A video released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) shows two men riding a moped into a park along the Hudson River in New York. One of the men gets off the moped and approaches the off-duty Border Patrol agent who was sitting on a rock near the riverbank. As the man approaches the agent, he appears to pull a weapon and begin shooting at the agent.

The agent moves for cover and begins firing back. The exchange of gunfire lasts about 25 seconds as the agent raised up twice and returned fire. He continued to move for cover as he fired. Eventually, the alleged robber gets up and gets on the moped. He appears to be wounded as he attempts to flee. The moped then drives away.

DHS Secretary Kristi Noem identified the suspected robber as Miguel Francisco Mora Nunez is a national and citizen of the Dominican Republic. She said the suspect illegally re-entered the U.S. in April 2023 and was apprehended by Border Patrol agents near San Luis, Arizona.

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection Southwest Land Border Encounters Report shows that the Dominican national was one of nearly 212,000 illegal aliens who entered the U.S. along the southern border that month. Due to overcrowding in detention facilities, Biden-era catch-and-release policies dictated that agents release the man into the U.S. interior.

Secretary Noem reported that Mora Nunez has a criminal warrant out of Massachusetts for kidnapping. His record includes several other crimes committed during his short stay in the United States.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin reported that the man received a final order of removal in 2003. That made his illegal re-entry in 2023 a felony. She reported that his prior arrests include felony 2nd and 3rd degree assaults. Despite this, Biden-era policies dictated that the man be released from custody.

President Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social that the Border Patrol agent “bravely fought off his attacker, despite his wounds, demonstrating enormous Skill and Courage.” He described the shooter as a “Monster freed into the Country under Joe Biden.”

The New York Post reported that the agent sustained two gunshot wounds to his face and forearm during the exchange. The agent survived his surgery and is in stable condition, according to DHS officials.

The Post reported:

At the time of his arrest for the shooting, he was wanted on kidnapping and weapons charges out of Massachusetts, sources said. He also had at least four arrests in New York City — where he was let go without bail each time, according to the sources. Morawas was nabbed twice just days apart August 2024 for allegedly assaulting a pregnant woman and threatening to kill another migrant with a machete. Then he was arrested for violating an order of protection in November 2024, and had another bench warrant out for his arrest issued in January, sources said.

Mora Nunez reportedly walked into a Bronx hospital after being shot three times by the agent. He remains in custody while the New York City Police Department investigates the failed robbery attempt.

LONDON – The killing of three girls at a summer dance class in England a year ago Tuesday, by a teenager misidentified as a migrant, triggered days of street violence directed at newcomers and minorities.

In the aftermath, communities came together to clear up the physical damage — but repairing the country’s social fabric is harder. Experts and community groups warn that the mix of anger, fear, misinformation and political agitating that fueled the violence remains. In recent weeks it has bubbled over again on the streets of Epping, near London.

“Given a trigger event, none of the conditions of what happened last year have gone away,” said Sunder Katwala of British Future, a think tank that looks at issues including integration and national identity. He said there is a “tense and quite febrile atmosphere” in some parts of the country.

A solemn anniversary

Three minutes of silence will be held Tuesday in the seaside town of Southport in northwest England, where the stabbing attack left three girls under 10 dead and eight children and two adults wounded.

Over the following days, violence erupted in Southport and across England, driven partly by online misinformation saying the attacker was a migrant who had arrived in the U.K. by small boat.

Because of British contempt of court and privacy laws, authorities were initially slow to disclose the suspect’s identity: Axel Rudakubana, a British-born 17-year-old obsessed with violence. He later pleaded guilty to murder and is serving a life sentence.

In the week after the attack, crowds in more than two dozen towns attacked hotels housing migrants, as well as mosques, police stations and a library. Some rioters targeted non-white people and threw bricks and fireworks at police.

With a few days, larger numbers of people took to the streets to reclaim their communities, sweeping up broken glass and sending a message of welcome to newcomers.

Tinderbox Britain

A year on, the sight of migrants crossing the English Channel in dinghies — more than 22,000 so far this year — provides a focus for those concerned about the impact of immigration. Those concerns are often amplified by online rumor, scapegoating and misinformation, some of it deliberate.

Add a sluggish economy, high housing costs, frayed public services and widespread distrust in politicians, and Britain, in the view of many commentators, has become a “tinderbox.”

Nigel Farage, leader of hard-right political party Reform UK, said last week that the country is close to “civil disobedience on a vast scale.”

The left-of-center Labour government agrees there is a problem. At a Cabinet meeting last week, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner noted that 17 of the 18 places that saw the worst disorder last year were among the most deprived in the country. She said that Britain is “a successful multi-ethnic, multi-faith country,” but the government must show it has “a plan to address people’s concerns and provide opportunities for everyone to flourish.”

The government has pledged to stop migrants trying to reach Britain across the Channel and to end the practice of lodging asylum-seekers in hotels, which have become flashpoints for tension.

Critics say the government risks legitimizing protesters who in many cases are driven by intolerance and want to drive immigrants from their homes.

In Ballymena, Northern Ireland, last month, rioters threw bricks, bottles, petrol bombs and fireworks and firebombed immigrants’ houses after two Romanian-speaking 14-year-old boys were charged with sexual assault.

Hundreds of people have protested this month outside a hotel housing asylum-seekers in Epping, a town on the edge of London, after a recently arrived migrant from Ethiopia was charged with sexual assault. He denies the charge.

Scattered protests

Protesters in Epping and a handful of other communities this summer have included local people, but also members of organized far-right groups who hope to capitalize on discord.

Tiff Lynch, who heads the Police Federation officers union, wrote in the Daily Telegraph newspaper that the Epping disorder was “a reminder of how little it takes for tensions to erupt and how ill-prepared we remain to deal with it.”

Learning from last summer’s violence, where the police and courts responded quickly to detain and charge hundreds of suspects, police have charged more than a dozen people over violence in Epping. A protest and antiracist counter-demonstration in the town on the weekend were peaceful.

The online realm is harder to police. The British government, like others around the world, has struggled with how to stop toxic content on sites including X. Under the ownership of self-styled free-speech champion Elon Musk, X has gutted teams that once fought misinformation and restored the accounts of banned conspiracy theories and extremists.

The government has cited the amount of time people spend alone online as a factor behind polarization and fraying social bonds.

Grounds for optimism

Families of the three girls who died in Southport — Alice da Silva Aguiar, 9, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and 6-year-old Bebe King — have called for quiet and respectful commemorations. Local authorities have asked people not to lay flowers, but to consider donating to causes set up in the victim’s memories.

The team behind Elsie’s Story, a children’s charity set up by Stancombe’s family, posted on Instagram: “Our girls, our town, will not be remembered for the events of that day, but for everything we are building together.”

Katwala said that despite a “sense of disconnection and frustration at national politics and national institutions,” there are grounds for optimism.

“Britain is less heated and less polarized than the United States, by quite a long way,” he said.

“People’s interpersonal trust remains quite high. Seven out of 10 people think their local area is a place where people from different backgrounds get on well. They’re just worried about the state of the nation.”",GNews,,,not found,,,,"wdiv clickondetroit, WDIV, ClickOnDetroit, Local 4 News Detroit, clickondetroit.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wdiv-clickondetroit/,https://ground.news/interest/click-on-detroit,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/wdiv-4-media-bias,LEAST BIASED (-0.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,,,,Center,Very High,Center,Center,Unknown,Center,Center,clickondetroit.com,,wdiv clickondetroit,84,USA,Y,J,WDIV ClickOnDetroit,Y

As previewed early on in President Trump’s second administration, Guantanamo prison is being used to detain migrants as officials work to get criminal illegal aliens off the streets.

DHS provided a sampling of some of the migrants detained at the facility, showcasing that these are not innocent individuals — as the left would like the masses to believe — but dangerous criminals with extensive pasts.

“Below are examples of nearly 30 high-threat, violent criminal illegal aliens that have committed heinous crimes and are detained at Guantanamo Bay,” DHS said, noting that these are all “convicted criminals with final orders of removal from an immigration judge.”

The criminal histories are lengthy.

RELATED: Guantanamo Bay Will Be Opened to “Full Capacity” to Detain “High-Priority Criminal Illegals”

Carlos Olivo Orellana, for example, is an illegal alien at Gitmo hailing from El Salvador, who has been convicted of lewd acts with a minor, as has Franklin Almendarez-Alvarez — an illegal alien from Honduras.

Olma Juarez-Mendez, from Guatemala, has been convicted of domestic abuse, while Larry Medina, an illegal from Venezuela, has been convicted of sexual assault.

Indian illegal immigrant Shubham Singh has been convicted of child pornography, and Nigel Tomlinson, hailing from the United Kingdom, has been convicted of child sexual abuse.

Other illegal aliens at the facility hail from Vietnam, China, Guatemala, Romania, El Salvador, and Jamaica, and their crimes include but are not limited to sexual assault, homicide, robbery, kidnapping, smuggling heroin, aggravated assault with a gun, and more.

More via DHS:

Hung Vo, an illegal alien from Vietnam, has been convicted of robbery with a weapon.

Quan Phung, an illegal alien from Vietnam, has been convicted of aggravated assault with a weapon.

Andis Noe Cortes Zepeda, an illegal alien from Honduras, has been convicted of sexual assault.

Antonio Erazo-Ramos, an illegal alien from Honduras, has been convicted of assault.

Xiang Liu, an illegal alien from China, has been convicted of robbery.

Jin Feng Lu, an illegal alien from China, has been convicted of homicide.

Hieu Tran, an illegal alien from Vietnam, has been convicted of robbery.

Ramiro Villanueva, an illegal alien from Colombia, has been convicted of smuggling cocaine.

Tien Minh Cao, an illegal alien from Vietnam, has been convicted of kidnapping.

Khang Huy Trang, an illegal alien from Vietnam, has been convicted of kidnapping for ransom.

Wen Lin, an illegal alien from China, has been convicted of robbery.

Guillermo Gonzales-Tiul, an illegal alien from Guatemala, has been convicted of assault.

Yong Liang, an illegal alien from China, has been convicted of kidnapping.

Luis Fernando Ospina Tabarez, an illegal alien from Colombia, has been convicted of smuggling heroin.

Ilie Bogde, an illegal alien from Romania, has been convicted of robbery.

Jose Diego Pereira Valdez, and illegal alien from El Salvador, has been convicted of aggravated assault with a gun.

Brayan Vasquez-Montero, an illegal alien from Colombia, has been convicted of aggravated assault with a weapon.

Nathaniel Akeen, an illegal alien from Liberia, has been convicted of robbery.

Eric Gresford Miller, an illegal alien from Jamaica, has been convicted of aggravated assault with a gun.

Victor Bonilla-Alvarez, an illegal alien from El Salvador, has been convicted of trafficking weapons.

Many of these crimes are consistent with those of the arrestees of other illegal immigrants — from Florida to California — as Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) works to take dangerous criminal illegals off the streets.

DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement that Guantanamo Bay is “holding the worst of the worst including child predators, rapists and murderers.”

“Whether it is CECOT, Alligator Alcatraz, Guantanamo Bay or another detention facility, these dangerous criminals will not be allowed to terrorize U.S. citizens. President Trump and Secretary Noem are using every tool available to get criminal illegal aliens off our streets and out of our country,” she said. “Our message is clear: Criminals are not welcome in the United States.”",NewsAPI,13.55,,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Mixed,31.01,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/,https://ground.news/interest/breitbart,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/breitbart,RIGHT (8.1),MIXED (6.4),USA,,Website,High Traffic,LOW CREDIBILITY,Right,Breitbart News Network LLC,2007,6,Right,Mixed,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,breitbart.com,,breitbart news,41,USA,Y,H,Breitbart,

His two-bedroom rental unit is carved up to house nine other men, and what he calls home is a modified closet just big enough for a mattress.

But now the government has ordered the 44-year-old salesman out of even that cramped space, which costs him $270 a month. He's one of the many low-paid foreign laborers caught up in a widespread crackdown by authorities in Dubai over illegal subletting.

That includes rooms lined with bunk beds that offer no privacy but are as cheap as a few dollars a night, as well as partitioned apartments like Hesham's, where plywood boards, drywall and plastic shower curtains can turn a flat into a makeshift dormitory for 10 or 20 people.

After a blaze at a high-rise in June, Dubai officials launched the campaign over concerns that partitioned apartments represent a major fire risk. Some of those evicted have been left scrambling to stay off the streets, where begging is illegal. Others fear they could be next, uncertain when or where inspectors might show up.

“Now we don’t know what we’ll do,” said Hesham, who's staying put until his landlord evicts him. Like others living in Dubai's cheapest and most crowded spaces, he spoke to The Associated Press on condition only his first name be used for fear of coming into the crosshairs of authorities enforcing the ban on illegal housing.

“We don’t have any other choice,"" he said.

Dubai Municipality, which oversees the city-state, declined an AP request for an interview. In a statement, it said authorities have conducted inspections across the emirate to curb fire and safety hazards — an effort it said would “ensure the highest standards of public safety” and lead to “enhanced quality of life” for tenants. It didn't address where those unable to afford legal housing would live in a city-state that’s synonymous with luxury yet outlaws labor unions and guarantees no minimum wage.

Dubai boom boosts rents

Dubai has seen a boom since the pandemic that shows no signs of stopping. Its population of 3.9 million is projected to grow to 5.8 million by 2040 as more people move into the commercial hub from abroad.

Much of Dubai’s real estate market caters to wealthy foreign professionals living there long-term. That leaves few affordable options for the majority of workers — migrants on temporary, low-wage contracts, often earning just several hundred dollars a month. Nearly a fifth of homes in Dubai were worth more than $1 million as of last year, property firm Knight Frank said. Developers are racing to build more high-end housing.

That continued growth has meant rising rents across the board. Short-term rentals are expected to cost 18% more by the end of this year compared to 2024, according to online rental company Colife. Most migrant workers the AP spoke to said they make just $300 to $550 a month.

In lower-income areas, they said, a partitioned apartment space generally rents for $220 to $270 a month, while a single bunk in an undivided room costs half as much. Both can cost less if shared, or more depending on size and location. At any rate, they are far cheaper than the average one-bedroom rental, which real estate firm Engel & Völkers said runs about $1,400 a month.

The United Arab Emirates, like other Gulf Arab nations, relies on low-paid workers from Africa and Asia to build, clean, babysit and drive taxi cabs. Only Emirati nationals, who are outnumbered nearly 9 to 1 by residents from foreign countries, are eligible for an array of government benefits, including financial assistance for housing.

Large employers, from construction firms and factories to hotels and resorts, are required by law to house workers if they are paid less than $400 a month, much of which they send home to families overseas.

However, many migrants are employed informally, making their living arrangements hard to regulate, said Steffen Hertog, an expert on Gulf labor markets at the London School of Economics and Political Science. The crackdown will push up their housing costs, creating “a lot of stress for people whose life situation is already precarious,” he said.

Hassan, a 24-year-old security guard from Uganda, shares a bed in a partitioned apartment with a friend. So far, the government hasn’t discovered it, but he has reason to be nervous, he said.

“They can tell you to leave without an option, without anywhere to go.”

Fires remain a threat in Dubai

Dubai has targeted overcrowded apartments in the past amid a spate of high-rise fires fueled by flammable siding material. The latest round of inspections came after a blaze in June at a 67-story tower in the Dubai Marina neighborhood, where some apartments had been partitioned.

More than 3,800 residents were forced to evacuate from the building, which had 532 occupied apartments, according to a police report. That means seven people on average lived in each of these units in the tower of one-, two- and three-bedroom flats. Dozens of homes were left uninhabitable.

There were no major injuries in that fire. However, another in 2023 in Dubai’s historic Deira neighborhood killed at least 16 people and injured another nine in a unit believed to have been partitioned.

Ebony, a 28-year-old odd-job worker from Ghana, was recently forced to leave a partitioned apartment after the authorities found out about it. She lived in a narrow space with a roommate who slept above her on a jerry-built plywood loft bed.

“Sometimes to even stand up,” she said, “your head is going to hit the plywood.”

She’s in a new apartment now, a single room that holds 14 others — and sometimes more than 20 as people come and go, sharing beds. With her income of about $400 a month, she said she didn’t have another option, and she’s afraid of being forced out again.

745,54,Video Aims to Set Record Straight on Conditions at ICE Illegal-Alien Detention Facilities,https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/07/17/ice-detention-facilities-have-highest-standards-trump-admin-releases-video-aimed-dispute-democrats-claims/,2025-07-17T18:12:23Z,Daily Signal,US,illegal alien,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement illegal-alien detention facility standards “are among the highest in the nation,” the agency insists.

Images of a library, a doctor’s office, a gym with kids playing dodgeball, and a clean cafeteria are featured in a new video ICE released Thursday touting the conditions of illegal-alien detention facilities in the U.S.

“Democrats and the mainstream media love to spread lies about ICE detention facilities, but this video shows the truth: ICE detention facilities have the highest standards,” Abigail Jackson, White House spokeswoman, told The Daily Signal.

ICE detention facilities “are safe, clean, and hold illegal aliens who are awaiting final removal proceedings,” Jackson added. “The mainstream media shouldn’t be so quick to believe lies from criminal illegal aliens complaining about ICE facilities when we can all see the truth.”

On Monday, NBC News ran a story with the headline, “Immigrants in overcapacity ICE detention say they’re hungry, raise food-quality concerns.” The New York Times reported on July 1: “Mass immigration arrests have led to overcrowding in detention facilities, with reports of unsanitary and inhumane conditions.” In June, NPR ran a story highlighting claims of overcrowding and a lack of food at detention facilities.

“We do have the highest detention standards out of any other prison system here in the United States,” Todd Lyons, acting ICE director, says in the video released on the social media platform X.

“ICE does not detain punitively,” according to Lyons. “We detain to remove people. We don’t want to have people in custody,” the acting director explained, adding that because of the high cost of detention, it is the goal of ICE to quickly and safely return illegal aliens to their home countries.

ICE’s detention standards are among the highest in the nation.

“ICE has higher detention standards than most U.S. prisons that hold actual U.S. citizens,” Tricia McLaughlin, Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said in a statement.

Illegal immigrants in detention facilities “are provided with proper meals, medical treatment, and have opportunities to communicate with lawyers and their family members,” McLaughlin added.

Detainees are provided medical care, according to the DHS assistant secretary, including mental health screenings and dental care within 12 hours of arriving at an ICE facility. They also receive “a full health assessment” in the first two weeks of their detention and have access to 24-hour emergency care.

“Ensuring the safety, security, and well-being of individuals in our custody is a top priority at ICE,” McLaughlin said.

Since the start of the Trump administration’s second term, more than 273,000 illegal aliens have been arrested and over 239,000 have been deported, according to the DHS. Because the deportation process takes time to carry out, and legal challenges to deportations have further slowed removals, DHS is operating multiple detention facilities to house illegal aliens until they can be removed from the U.S.

In early July, the Trump administration opened a new detention facility in the Florida Everglades commonly referred to as “Alligator Alcatraz.” A bipartisan group of lawmakers toured the large facility on July 12.

“It’s gross and disgusting,” Rep. Maxwell Frost, D-Fla., said of the facility.

“What I saw made my heart sink,” Frost said, describing what he called “cages,” each holding 32 illegal aliens. According to Frost, the detainees were not getting enough food, “being fed, essentially, a small sandwich and a bag of chips.”

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, was critical of Democrats in Florida who are speaking out against the facility.

“They want to basically put the thumb on the scale for folks here illegally to just stay in the state of Florida,” DeSantis said, questioning why some Democrats in his state are “fighting for foreign nationals that came into the country illegally.”",NewsAPI,17.1,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Problematic,20.15,"The Daily Signal, dailysignal.com",not found,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-signal,,,,,,,,Right,,,4,,,Unknown,Unknown,Right,Right,Right,dailysignal.com,,daily signal,44,USA,,,,
170,263,UK and Germany sign deal against people smugglers as Europe struggles to halt Channel crossings,https://www.clickondetroit.com/news/world/2024/12/10/uk-and-germany-sign-deal-against-people-smugglers-as-europe-struggles-to-halt-channel-crossings/,2024-12-10T12:30:24Z,WDIV ClickOnDetroit,US,channel crossings,"LONDON – The U.K. and Germany pledged Tuesday to share intelligence and expertise against the people-smuggling gangs that send migrants across the English Channel in small boats, the latest effort by European countries to stop the dangerous journeys.

Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and her German counterpart, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, signed a “joint action plan” at a meeting in London. The U.K. said that under the deal, Germany will make it a specific offense to facilitate the smuggling of migrants to the U.K. Many of the rubber dinghies used to ferry migrants across the Channel are stored in Germany.

“The criminal gangs who organize dangerous small boats across the channel that undermine our border security, that put lives at risk, are also the same gangs that are operating in Germany, that are operating right across Europe and beyond,” Cooper said. “Law enforcement needs to operate across borders as well.”

Faeser said that the cooperation would include “maintaining a high investigative pressure, exchanging information between our security authorities as best as possible, and persistently investigating financial flows to identify the criminals operating behind the scenes.”

The two countries said they would also work to remove migrant-smuggling content from social media platforms, where many of the smuggling gangs tout their services.

The two ministers signed the agreement before a meeting in London of the “Calais Group” of the U.K., Germany, Belgium, France and the Netherlands, along with the European Union’s police and border agencies, Europol and Frontex.

The United Kingdom's center-left government is trying to rebuild its law enforcement and intelligence ties with the U.K.'s neighbors after the country’s exit from the EU in 2020. Brexit complicated international cooperation by taking the U.K. out of Europol and the bloc’s intelligence-sharing mechanism.

Despite French and U.K. efforts to stop it, the cross-Channel route remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Many migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.

More than 31,000 migrants have made the perilous crossing of one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes so far this year, more than in all of 2023, though fewer than in 2022. More than 70 people have perished in the attempts this year, according to U.K. officials, making 2024 the deadliest since the number of channel crossings began surging in 2018.

Tom Tiffany (R-WI) is calling for all federal funds to be cut off from Dane County, Wisconsin, a sanctuary jurisdiction, after high school sweethearts 18-year-old Hallie Helgeson and 19-year-old Brady Heiling were killed in a drunk driving crash, allegedly at the hands of an illegal alien.

As Breitbart News reported, on July 20, illegal alien Noelia A. Martinez of Honduras, 30 years old, was allegedly drunk driving in Dane County when she crashed into Hallie and Brady.

Hallie was killed immediately and pronounced dead at the scene, while Brady was left in critical condition, airlifted to a nearby hospital, and died from his injuries on July 25. Hallie and Brady were high school sweethearts and had attended senior prom together shortly before the crash.

Martinez, who had a criminal record that included several driving violations, was apparently able to hide from federal immigration enforcement partly due to Dane County’s sanctuary policy, which refuses to honor ICE detainers. These detainers are requests for custody whenever an illegal alien is released from local custody.

Tiffany, who represents a district north of Dane County, said Hallie and Brady’s deaths ought to spur federal officials into action — cutting off “all funding to sanctuary jurisdictions.”

“An illegal alien with a prior drunk driving conviction killed two teens in Dane County,” Tiffany wrote on X. “DHS says Dane County’s sanctuary policies protected the illegal from deportation. We must end these dangerous Democrat policies and cut all funding to sanctuary jurisdictions.”

Tiffany also called out Dane County Sheriff Kalvin Barrett, who has defended sanctuary policies even since Hallie and Brady’s deaths.

“Sheriff Barrett called me a LIAR when I warned Dane County’s sanctuary policies put lives at risk,” Tiffany wrote. “Now, two teens are dead after a repeat illegal alien offender was allowed to remain in the community. How many more Americans have to die before Democrats end this lawlessness?”

Tiffany noted the House passed H.R. 875, the Jeremy and Angel Seay and Sergeant Brandon Mendoza Protect Our Communities from DUIs Act of 2025, earlier this year. The bill requires federal immigration officials to take custody of and deport illegal aliens convicted of drunk driving.

One hundred and sixty House Democrats opposed the bill.

“This year, 160 House Democrats voted against deporting illegal aliens convicted of drunk driving,” Tiffany wrote on X. “Now two teens are dead — killed by an illegal alien with a previous drunk driving conviction. This is what happens when politicians put illegals over American lives.”

Jon Luke Evans, a Jamaican illegal alien, was employed as a reserve police officer with the Old Orchard Beach Police Department when he was arrested on July 25. ICE and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives were alerted about Evans after he tried to purchase a firearm illegally.

“The fact that a police department would hire an illegal alien and unlawfully issue him a firearm while on duty would be comical if it weren’t so tragic. We have a police department that was knowingly breaking the very law they are charged with enforcing in order to employ an illegal alien,” said ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations Boston acting Field Office Director Patricia H. Hyde. “ICE Boston will continue to prioritize public safety by arresting and removing criminal alien threats from our New England communities.” (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Mother Of Man Slain By Illegal Has Message For Dems Protesting Trump’s Border Crackdown)

Evans entered the U.S. legally through Miami International Airport on Sept. 24, 2023, but overstayed his visa after it expired on Oct. 1, 2023, according to ICE.

The Old Orchard Beach Police Department stated that Evans was hired in May as a summer reserve officer. The department said it reviewed multiple forms of identification and submitted his I-9 federal work authorization form to the Department of Homeland Security’s (DHS) E-Verify system, which approved the form on May 12.

“Evans passed all physical and medical checks, passed a background check, was approved by Homeland Security to work in the United States, and underwent the standard course of training for a reserve officer before he was deployed on duty,” said Old Orchard Beach Police Chief Elise Chard. “Reserve officers face a lengthy probation period, and Evans’ probationary employment status is now under review.”

DHS did not respond to the Daily Caller News Foundation’s request for comment.

Reserve officers are assigned to beach patrol duty and community policing, receive firearm training and are issued a department firearm. However, they are not allowed to take the firearm home or carry personal firearms while on duty, according to the police department.

Maine is among several states that allow non-citizens to work in law enforcement positions. In April, ICE officers arrested an illegal immigrant from Congo working as a corrections officer in Falmouth, Maine, after he allegedly attempted to illegally purchase a firearm.

The arrests, each carried out by Immigration and Customs Enforcement, is a fulfillment of DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and President Donald Trump’s pledge to “target the worst of the worst,” according to Tricia McLaughlin, DHS assistant secretary.

Since Trump returned to office on Jan. 20, the Trump administration has arrested nearly 300,000 illegal aliens and deported more than 239,000, according to DHS.

ICE Denver has apprehended Federico Fong-Nunez, 53, an illegal alien from Mexico with 21 criminal convictions, including aggravated assault, burglary, and felony menacing.

Luis Alberto Leonardo Cortes-Rivera is 34 and from Mexico. He has nine criminal convictions in Los Angeles, including burglary, grand theft, and tampering with a vehicle.

ICE Dallas has arrested 46-year-old Honduran Rureiro Falkao, an illegal alien who has been convicted of possession of methamphetamine in Oklahoma City.

Olinda Micaela Gonzalez-Ortiz, 21, is from Guatemala and has a criminal history that includes a conviction for a hit and run in Salisbury, Maryland. ICE Baltimore arrested her over the weekend.

Jhon Jervis Chavez-De La Rosa, also 21, is from Venezuela. ICE Houston arrested him over the weekend. He has a criminal history that includes conviction of assault causing bodily injury.

While 70% of the illegal aliens ICE has arrested since Trump returned to the White House have either been convicted of or charged with a crime, and a Harvard-Harris Poll finds that 75% of U.S. voters support efforts to remove criminal illegal aliens from the U.S., violence against ICE officers has skyrocketed in the past six months.

“Our brave law enforcement is facing an 830% increase in assaults against them, and yet they continue to arrest violent criminals and drug traffickers every single day,” McLaughlin said.

Anti-ICE demonstrations have grown violent in recent weeks in cities across the U.S., including Los Angeles, New York City, and Austin, Texas.

“We will not allow sanctuary politicians, activist hacks, or rioters to stand in our way of protecting the American people,” McLaughlin said. “Our message is clear: Criminal illegal aliens are not welcome in the United States.”",NewsAPI,17.1,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Problematic,20.15,"The Daily Signal, dailysignal.com",not found,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/daily-signal,,,,,,,,Right,,,4,,,Unknown,Unknown,Right,Right,Right,dailysignal.com,,daily signal,44,USA,,,,

(Gareth Fuller/PA via AP)

PARIS – The U.K. and France signed an agreement Monday that will see more police patrol beaches in northern France in an attempt to stop migrants from trying to cross the English Channel in small boats — a regular source of friction between the two.

As scores of people were picked up and brought ashore Monday by a U.K. Border Force vessel, the British government said it had agreed to pay France 72.2 million euros ($75 million) in 2022-2023 — almost 10 million euros more than under an existing deal — in exchange for France increasing security patrols along the coast by 40%.

That includes 350 more gendarmes and police guarding beaches in Calais and Dunkirk, as well as more drones and night vision equipment to help officers detect unauthorized crossings.

British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said the deal would mean “for the first time, British officials embedded in French operations to strengthen coordination and the effectiveness of our operations.”

The agreement, signed by French Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin and British Home Secretary Suella Braverman in Paris, contains proposals to fight crime by harvesting information from intercepted migrants to help tackle smuggling networks.

No specific target for boat interceptions was included.

The U.K. receives fewer asylum-seekers than many European nations, including Germany, France and Italy, but thousands of migrants from around the world travel to northern France each year in hopes of crossing the channel. Some want to reach the U.K. because they have friends or family there, others because they speak English or because it's perceived to be easy to find work.

In recent years there's been a sharp increase in the number of people attempting the journey in dinghies and other small craft as authorities clamped down on other routes such as stowing away on buses or trucks.

More than 40,000 people have arrived in Britain after making the hazardous Channel trip so far this year, up from 28,000 in all of 2021 and 8,500 in 2020.

The European Union borders and coast guard agency, Frontex, says 62,323 migrants were detected in the channel in the first 10 months of 2022, a 70% increase on the same period last year. The figure includes both successful and intercepted crossings.

Dozens have died in the attempt, including 27 people in November 2021 when a packed smuggling boat capsized.

Le Monde published a chilling investigation Monday into the French coast guard’s mismanagement of that sinking, the deadliest to date. It quoted from repeated, increasingly desperate distress calls from the boat, communications that are part of a French judicial investigation.

French coast guard officials demanded more information of the people aboard, or told them to call British emergency services instead, according to the newspaper. It quoted coast guard officials as saying they underestimated the boat’s problems because they get so many similar calls from migrant vessels in trouble, and don’t have enough resources to come to everyone’s aid.

Britain and France have long wrangled over how to stop the people-smuggling gangs that organize the journeys.

Monday's announcement comes as Sunak, who took office three weeks ago, aims to improve relations with Britain’s neighbors, which soured under former Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his briefly serving successor Liz Truss.

Sunak met French President Emmanuel Macron last week at the COP27 climate conference in Egypt, and the first U.K.-France summit in several years is planned for early 2023.

In another attempt to deter the crossings, Britain’s government has announced a controversial plan to send people who arrive in small boats on a one-way journey to Rwanda, to break the business model of smuggling gangs. Critics say the plan is immoral and impractical, and it is being challenged in the courts.

Critics also have slammed the British government for failing to process asylum applications quickly, leaving thousands stuck in overcrowded holding centers and temporary accommodation.

Enver Solomon, chief executive of the Refugee Council charity in Britain, said enforcement measures would do little to stop the cross-channel traffic.

“The government must take a more comprehensive approach and create an orderly, fair and humane asylum system,” he said. “It is a global issue which will not be resolved by enforcement measures alone.”

Braverman, a champion of the Rwanda plan who has been accused by critics of demonizing migrants, acknowledged “there are no quick fixes."" But she told broadcasters that Monday's arrangement will “significantly increase the number of French gendarmes patrolling the beaches in northern France and ensure U.K. and French officers are working hand in hand to stop the people smugglers.”

“If your ex is in this country illegally, please feel free to reach out to our office,” Uthmeier wrote on X. “We’d be happy to assist.” (RELATED: Alligator Alcatraz Detainees Claim ‘Grim’ Conditions Over Being Fed Ham Sandwiches)

He added that his office recently acted on a tip from someone whose abusive ex had overstayed a tourist visa — “He is now cued up for deportation,” the attorney general wrote.

756,54,Second Catholic Diocese Allows Illegal Immigrants to Skip Mass,https://www.dailysignal.com/2025/07/12/second-catholic-diocese-allows-illegal-immigrants-skip-mass/,2025-07-12T18:00:00Z,Daily Signal,US,illegal alien,"The bishop of the sixth largest Catholic diocese in the U.S. announced Tuesday that he was issuing a dispensation for illegal immigrants from the weekly obligation of attending Sunday Mass over fears of recent U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement operations, marking the second time a diocese has issued such a dispensation over the last three months.

Bishop Alberto Rojas, the head of the Diocese of San Bernardino east of Los Angeles that serves about 1 million Catholics, stated in the decree that, “All members of the faithful in the Diocese of San Bernardino who, due to genuine fear of immigration enforcement actions, are unable to attend Sunday Mass or Masses on holy days of obligation are dispensed from this obligation.” Rojas further declared that the dispensation would remain in effect “until further notice or until such time as the circumstances necessitating this decree are sufficiently resolved.”

The decree comes amid the Donald Trump administration’s ongoing stepped-up efforts to deport illegal immigrants, mostly those who have criminal backgrounds. In recent weeks, unverified reports have surfaced claiming that federal agents have entered churches to make arrests, which have been disputed by the Trump administration.

One report noted that two men were taken into custody in the parking lot of Our Lady of Lourdes Church in the San Bernardino Diocese last week. In response to claims that ICE agents entered the church hall, Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security Tricia McLaughlin stated, “The accusation that ICE entered a church to make an arrest [is] FALSE. ICE conducted a traffic stop on an illegal alien on June 20 in the general proximity of Our Lady of Lourdes Church, Montclair, California. The illegal alien chose to pull into the church parking lot. Officers then safely made the arrest.”

In a separate incident that same day, a “longtime parishioner” of the church was also taken into custody by federal agents on the church grounds when no one else was present.

Notably, the San Bernardino bishop’s dispensation from Mass attendance came even though there have been no reports nationwide of federal agents conducting enforcement operations inside churches while services are being conducted.

In May, the Catholic Diocese of Nashville also issued a dispensation from the Sunday Mass obligation over immigration enforcement activities, stating that “no Catholic is obligated to attend Mass on Sunday if doing so puts their safety at risk.”

Such broad dispensations from Sunday Mass attendance are exceedingly rare in the Catholic Church. The only comparable recent example happened in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic, when most U.S. dioceses controversially suspended public Mass over fears of the lethality of the virus.

In response to the dispensations, a United States Conference of Catholic Bishops spokesperson told Axios, “The Catholic Church recognizes that civil authorities have a duty to enforce laws and keep communities safe from violent criminals. However, we also believe that the God-given dignity of each person must be upheld, which includes acknowledging their right to emigrate in search of a better life and to express their religious beliefs openly and without fear.”

Eric Sammons, a Catholic author and commentator, told The Washington Stand that the broad dispensations from Mass attendance are concerning due to their political nature.

“Church history is full of brave souls who faced persecution and even death in order to attend Mass—they understood how important it was to be there each and every Sunday,” he observed. “Yet some of our bishops decided to make a political stunt of the Mass by dispensing from the obligation if someone feared being picked up by ICE (in spite of no evidence that illegal immigrants have been arrested in places of worship). As we saw with their COVID-[19] era shutdowns, too many bishops see Sunday Mass as optional, easily dispensed if in any way inconvenient.”

“As UK citizens become increasingly frustrated by a system weaponized against them, UK authorities wanted Big Tech to censor discussions about immigration and “narratives about the police and a ‘two-tier’ system,'” Jordan wrote.

“Britons were rightly concerned about a justice system that treated government critics more harshly than violent criminals. Right-of-center leaders in the UK were justified in criticizing this “two-tier” system of justice,” he continued.

Jordan revealed that the Committee obtained documents that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Technology Secretary Peter Kyle “tried to censor people who called out the UK’s two-tier justice system for what it was.”

President Donald Trump has warned Starmer that it would be a “mistake” for the British government to censor his Truth Social platform under the recently enacted Online Safety Act.

“We are not censoring anyone,” Starmer rebutted. “We’ve got some measures that are there to protect children.”

In one email to a big tech platform, one of the UK’s big tech regulators, known as the Department for Science, Innovation, and Technology (DSIT), told platforms to monitor “narratives about … a ‘two tier system.'”

DSIT told platforms to “come back to us” on “any measures you have taken in response.”

“The implication was clear: the UK was telling platforms to censor true ‘narratives’ about a ‘two-tier’ justice system,” Jordan wrote.

The Ohio congressman noted that when one British citizen wanted to know where the government housed asylum seekers on the UK taxpayer dime, the British government told platforms to censor him:

The same government also sought to “silence discussions about Europe’s mass migration policies.”

He wrote, “Just a couple days after the UK’s demand to Big Tech, London’s top police officer warned Americans that he would target them with prosecution for online posts he found offensive—no matter what country they were posted from.”

Jordan remarked, “The message: Criticize @Keir_Starmer or UK immigration policy from anywhere in the world, and you should watch out.”

Teasing that there is more to come from their investigation, Jordan wrote, “The Committee continues to receive documents showing censorship of conservatives and true information from around the world. But above all else, governments always want to censor criticism of the government.”",NewsAPI,13.55,,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,Right,Mixed,31.01,,https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/breitbart/,https://ground.news/interest/breitbart,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/breitbart,RIGHT (8.1),MIXED (6.4),USA,,Website,High Traffic,LOW CREDIBILITY,Right,Breitbart News Network LLC,2007,6,Right,Mixed,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,breitbart.com,,breitbart news,41,USA,Y,H,Breitbart,
758,8,Venezuela frees 10 Americans in swap for deported men in El Salvador,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/18/venezuela-frees-10-americans-in-swap-for-deported-migrants-in-el-salvador,2025-07-18T21:08:52Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"President Donald Trump had deported nearly 200 Venezuelan men to an El Salvador prison, raising fears for their safety.

An international deal has been struck that has allowed Venezuelans deported from the United States and imprisoned in El Salvador to return to their home country, in exchange for the release of American citizens and political prisoners held in Venezuela.

On Friday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirmed that 10 Americans had been released as part of the deal.

“Thanks to @POTUS’s [the president of the United States’] leadership, ten Americans who were detained in Venezuela are on their way to freedom,” Rubio wrote on social media.

El Salvador’s President Nayib Bukele also celebrated the deal, saying that all of the Venezuelan deportees detained in his country have been “handed over”.

“We carried out this exchange in return for a considerable number of Venezuelan political prisoners, people that regime had kept in its prisons for years, as well as all the American citizens it was holding as hostages,” Bukele, a US ally, wrote in a statement on social media.

“These individuals are now en route to El Salvador, where they will make a brief stop before continuing their journey home.”

Bukele has previously indicated he would be open to a detainee swap to release political prisoners in Venezuela. He and US President Donald Trump have long been critics of their Venezuelan counterpart, Nicolas Maduro, a socialist who has led Venezuela since 2013.

“This operation is the result of months of negotiations with a tyrannical regime that had long refused to release one of its most valuable bargaining chips: its hostages,” Bukele added.

The Venezuelan government confirmed it had received 252 citizens deported from the US and held in El Salvador.

In addition, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello told the media that seven children separated from their parents during deportations had also been sent from the US to Venezuela.

Friday’s deal is the latest example of the complex, international negotiations underpinning President Donald Trump’s push for mass deportation in the US.

Such a deal has long been rumoured between the three countries.

But the arrangement raises questions about how Trump’s mass deportation push might be used as leverage for other foreign policy priorities. It has also reignited scrutiny about the treatment of individuals deported from the US to third-party countries they have no relation to.

A controversial deportation

Venezuela has protested the deportation of its citizens from the US to El Salvador, where more than 200 people were sent to a maximum-security prison known as the Terrorism Confinement Centre (CECOT) in March.

To facilitate that transfer, President Trump had invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 — a wartime law only used three times prior — to allow for the swift removal of foreign nationals.

The US leader argued that undocumented migration into the US constituted an “invasion” of criminals from outside countries.

His use of that law, however, has faced ongoing legal challenges about its constitutionality.

Critics also have pointed out that El Salvador has faced criticism for alleged human rights abuses in its prisons, including beatings, torture and sleep deprivation.

The CECOT prison is part of Bukele’s own efforts at mass incarceration. It opened in 2023 with space to hold up to 40,000 people.

Trump argued that deporting the 200-plus Venezuelans was an urgent matter because they belonged to gangs like Tren de Aragua. Bukele echoed that accusation on Friday, saying that all the Venezuelan deportees were “accused of being part of the criminal organization Tren de Aragua”.

But critics point out that some of the men had no criminal record whatsoever.

Lawyers representing some of the deported Venezuelans have since issued complaints alleging that their clients were targeted based on their clothing choices or tattoos, which US immigration officials then used to falsely tie them to gangs.

Third-party deportations

The Trump administration has also maintained that deportations to third-party countries like El Salvador are necessary for immigrants whose home countries will not accept them.

Venezuela has, in the past, refused to accept deportees from the US. Maduro and Trump have had a notoriously rocky relationship. In 2020, Trump even placed a $15m bounty for information that could lead to Maduro’s arrest.

But rather than return to the “maximum pressure” campaign that defined his first term as president, Trump has instead sought negotiations with the Venezuelan government during his second term.

In response, the Maduro government has signalled that it is willing to accept Venezuelan deportees from the US.

For example, it hosted US special envoy Richard Grenell in Caracas in late January, a trip that resulted in the release of six Americans held in Venezuela. The Maduro administration also released a detained US Air Force veteran in May, following another meeting with Grenell.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said that Grenell’s mission was to ensure “all US detainees in Venezuela are returned home”. It is unclear how many remain in the country.

The US government, however, continues to deny the legitimacy of Maduro’s presidency. Maduro’s contested election to a third term in 2024 — marred by allegations of fraud — has further weakened his standing on the world stage.

Controversies over mass deportation

The Trump administration, meanwhile, has contended with controversies of its own. Last week, The New York Times reported that the Trump White House had “botched” the agreement to free Americans in Venezuela, after Grenell and Secretary of State Marco Rubio proposed rival deals.

The Times said that Rubio had proposed a trade: American prisoners for the Venezuelans held in El Salvador. But Grenell had offered different terms that would allow Venezuela to continue its trade relationship with the oil giant Chevron, a major boon for its beleaguered economy.

The result was reportedly confusion and uncertainty.

Furthermore, the Trump administration has faced scrutiny at home for its apparent unwillingness to repatriate immigrants who may have been unjustly deported.

In June, District Judge James Boasberg ordered the Trump administration to ensure the Venezuelan men held in El Salvador received due process in the US. In his decision, Boasberg pointed out that their swift removal in March prevented them from contesting both their deportations and the allegations that they were gang members.

That court order, however, has been put on hold by a federal appeals court in Washington.

Friday’s deal also raises questions about previous Trump administration claims that it was unable to release the deported men from the CECOT prison. Trump officials have long argued that, while in El Salvador, the deportees lie beyond the reach of the US government.

El Salvador’s President Bukele has also claimed he had no power to allow the men’s return. In an Oval Office appearance in April, Bukele spoke to the case of Kilmar Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran man briefly held in CECOT after he was wrongfully deported in March.

“The question is preposterous. How can I smuggle a terrorist into the United States? I don’t have the power to return him to the United States,” Bukele told a reporter.

759,203,Modernizing data center infrastructure: how businesses thrive beyond legacy data centers,https://www.techradar.com/pro/modernizing-data-center-infrastructure-how-businesses-thrive-beyond-legacy-data-centers,2025-07-07T07:31:22Z,TechRadar,US,mass migration,"Data centers are the backbone of the digital age; however, many are stuck in the past. Legacy facilities, which were built for a different era, are now struggling under the weight of modern computing demands. With ageing infrastructure, poor energy performance and rising operational costs, these outdated environments are quickly becoming a liability in a world that demands speed, scalability and sustainability.

In light of this, forward-thinking organizations are taking action and migrating their core applications from traditional on-premise infrastructure to the cloud. Such a move achieves modernization of a bank’s IT environment whilst also positioning it to be more agile and cost-efficient when it comes to customer-centric innovation in an ever-evolving digital economy.

Despite this, transforming legacy data centers is not the undemanding cure-all that banks and other financial organizations might be vying for, or even economically viable for that matter. For some, the path forward means shutting down outdated facilities altogether. For example, Singaporean telco Singtel announced last year the closure of five of its legacy data centers in Singapore as part of its plans to pivot towards sustainable, AI-focused facilities, reflecting a wider shift to a more measured and strategic approach to IT infrastructure investment.

The growing need for data agility and cloud-native platforms

Organizations are therefore under growing pressure to respond at speed, often forced to relocate critical data with little notice when closures or capacity shifts occur. It's a logistical challenge, but one that underscores a broader truth, which is that data agility is no longer optional. Rather, it has become a critical need for financial organizations to be able to access, process and act on data, especially in an era where the priorities for technology in an organization can shift overnight.

With ESG standards now central to the tech industry’s agenda, traditional data centers that overheat, guzzle energy and leave a heavy environmental footprint are increasingly out of step with where the sector is headed. But the challenges go far beyond sustainability. Legacy infrastructures create operational drag given the fragmented systems, inconsistent data quality and rigid architectures that hinder fast, informed decision-making.

Cloud-native models provide real-time insights and the ability to scale on demand, which in itself stands as a sharp contrast to outdated data infrastructures that require significant upfront investment based on predicted needs. This often leaves businesses stuck with inflexible systems and delays whilst waiting for hardware. Security is another growing concern.

Whilst cloud providers constantly update and strengthen their defenses, many on-premises teams struggle to keep up. Add to that the rising pressure of data sovereignty regulations and escalating energy costs, and the need to modernize becomes not just compelling, but critical.

A smart migration starts with a clear strategy

Given its elastic scalability, precise cost controls and robust, built-in security, it is certainly no surprise that many organizations are turning to the cloud. However, whilst the benefits are clear, the journey isn’t instantaneous. Successful cloud adoption requires a well-thought-out roadmap. The first step is crafting a strategy that’s tightly aligned with business objectives.

This translates to assessing workloads based on their impact, prioritizing mission-critical applications and selecting the right deployment model, whether it is public, private, or a combination of the two. Multicloud is increasingly gaining traction as it helps avoid vendor lock-in and gives businesses the freedom to leverage the unique strengths of different providers.

But moving to the cloud must be done with precision, especially in complex, legacy-heavy environments such as those that can be found in traditional banks. A rushed migration can have the opposite effect of what financial organizations may hope for when undertaking mass data migration to cloud-native platforms.

Cloud adoption affects multiple parts, if not every part of the business, be it applications and data architectures or operating models and governance frameworks. Missteps in timing or execution can lead to budgets being stretched too tight, unplanned downtimes and costly inefficiencies. Mitigating this risk requires financial organizations to approach migration as a deliberate, end-to-end transformation that reshapes how banks operate, innovate and ultimately deliver value to their customers, instead of a quick fix or a reactive measure.

At the same time, integration of robust governance at every stage of the journey is critical, with security, compliance and data protection ensured from the very outset. With cloud environments demanding continuous optimization, it is a key consideration that the work does not stop at the point of migration. Performance and cost efficiency must be reviewed regularly to ensure systems are running as expected and delivering value.

Recent advances with generative AI and AI tools can also help to accelerate the migration from on-premises legacy data centers to cloud environments by automating discovery, dependency mapping and workload classification. These tools analyze infrastructure and application behavior to identify optimal cloud targets and architectures. AI coding products also assist in refactoring legacy code, creation of testing and documentation, predicting migration risks, and simulating performance in the cloud, reducing migration time and enhancing planning accuracy.

The symptoms of ageing infrastructure in banking

This imperative for cloud migration is especially acute in the banking sector, where traditional institutions are locked in a race against digital-first challengers that can deploy new features in a matter of weeks, whilst legacy banks remain reliant on ageing mainframes. The cost of inaction is no longer hypothetical.

Earlier this year, more than 1.2 million UK customers were hit by banking disruptions on payday, marking a critical moment for individuals and businesses alike. Major high-street banks reported service failures ranging from login delays to hours-long customer service waits.

These outages weren’t isolated incidents, but symptoms of deeper systemic fragility tied to ageing IT systems. In contrast, cloud-native organizations are built for resilience, scalability and real-time responsiveness, which are qualities that legacy setups struggle to emulate.

These failures were not just unfortunate, but predictable and more importantly, preventable, further highlighting the point that embracing cloud-native infrastructure is no longer a long-term goal, rather an urgent priority for maintaining customer trust and securing future competitiveness for incumbent banks.

Data agility as a means of being future-ready

Ultimately, data agility is the engine of faster decision-making, operational flexibility and innovation, whilst cloud-native platforms make that agility possible. By using a fully cloud-native core, financial institutions can sidestep the constraints of traditional infrastructure allowing them to focus squarely on customer needs and accelerate time to market in ways that legacy banks simply would not be able to through traditional channels.

Achieving these results requires organizations to invest not just in modern cloud platforms, but in a data-driven culture that treats information as a strategic asset. Real-time data streaming paves the way to immediate insights, rather than lagging by hours or days. And as market demands continue to evolve, success depends on ongoing integration and innovation.

Cloud transformation isn’t a one-off milestone; it’s a continuous journey of aligning strategy, technology and execution to stay ahead of what’s next.

760,8,US envoy Steve Witkoff suggests Gaza ceasefire deal is close,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/8/us-envoy-steve-witkoff-suggests-gaza-ceasefire-deal-is-close,2025-07-08T20:16:25Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"Trump aide says Washington ‘hopeful’ a 60-day truce between Israel and Hamas can be reached by the end of the week.

An aide to United President Donald Trump has suggested a Gaza ceasefire is close, saying Washington hopes to see an agreement finalised by the end of the week.

“We’re in proximity talks now, and we had four issues, and now we’re down to one after two days of proximity talks,” special US envoy Steve Witkoff told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.

“So we are hopeful that by the end of this week, we will have an agreement that will bring us into a 60-day ceasefire.”

Witkoff said the deal would see the release of 10 Israeli captives and the bodies of nine. He added that the Trump administration thinks the deal “will lead to a lasting peace in Gaza”.

Earlier on Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told reporters in Washington, DC, that while Israel “still has to finish the job in Gaza”, negotiators are “certainly working” on a ceasefire.

Trump and Netanyahu dined together on Monday at the White House during the Israeli leader’s third US visit since the president began his second term on January 20.

The two leaders met again later on Tuesday.

“He’s coming over later. We’re going to be talking about, I would say, almost exclusively Gaza. We’ve got to get that solved,” the US president told reporters at a cabinet meeting in the White House earlier in the day.

“It’s a tragedy, and he wants to get it solved, and I want to get it solved, and I think the other side wants to.”

Qatar confirmed on Tuesday that Hamas and Israeli delegations are in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.

“There is a positive engagement right now. The mediation teams – the Qataris and the Egyptians – are working around the clock to make sure that there is some consensus built on the framework towards the talks,” Qatari Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Majed al-Ansari said.

Israel’s war on Gaza has killed more than 57,500 Palestinians, internally displaced nearly the entire population of the enclave and placed hundreds of thousands of people on the verge of starvation.

United Nations experts and rights group have described Israel’s military campaign in Gaza as a genocide.

Netanyahu suggested on Monday that the US and Israel are working to ensure the mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza – an idea first proposed by Trump in February.

Israeli officials have been framing the push to remove all Palestinians from Gaza Gaza as an effort to encourage “voluntary migration” from the territory.

“If people want to stay, they can stay, but if they want to leave, they should be able to leave. It shouldn’t be a prison. It should be an open place and give people a free choice,” Netanyahu told reporters.

Rights advocates said the removal of Palestinians from Gaza, which would amount to ethnic cleansing, cannot be considered voluntary.

Prominent legal expert Ralph Wilde said that with the widespread destruction, siege and daily attacks in Gaza, the concept of free choice to stay there or leave “is a lie”.

“It’s forced displacement because that isn’t a choice that is made freely,” Wilde told Al Jazeera.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,
761,8,Eight people lose appeal in US against deportation to South Sudan,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/4/migrants-in-us-detention-lose-appeal-against-deportation-to-south-sudan,2025-07-04T23:48:53Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"The men are immigrants from Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar and Vietnam. One man is of South Sudanese origin.

Eight men in United States detention have lost a last-ditch attempt to avoid deportation to South Sudan, a country facing ongoing criticism for human rights abuses.

On Friday, Judge Brian Murphy of Boston denied the eleventh-hour appeal, which has been the subject of a flurry of legal activity throughout the day.

The men have been held at a US military base in Djibouti since late May, when an earlier deportation flight to South Sudan was halted by the courts.

The US Supreme Court has twice ruled that the Trump administration could deport the men to countries outside of their homelands. Its latest decision was issued on Thursday [PDF].

The appeal, filed that night, argued that repeated efforts under President Donald Trump to deport the men to South Sudan were “impermissibly punitive”, pointing to the US Constitution’s barring of “cruel and unusual punishment”.

The US Department of State advises American citizens to avoid South Sudan due to an ongoing armed conflict. It has in the past accused South Sudan of “extrajudicial killings, forced disappearances, torture and cases of cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment”.

Legal battle

The US Department of Justice indicated that the eight men were set to be flown to South Sudan by 7pm US Eastern Time (23:00 GMT) on Friday. They are immigrants from countries like Cuba, Laos, Mexico, Myanmar, South Sudan and Vietnam.

Initially, the case was assigned to US District Judge Randolph Moss in Washington, DC, who signalled he was sympathetic to the deportees’ request.

He briefly ordered the deportation to be paused until 4:30pm Eastern Time (20:30 GMT) but ultimately decided to transfer the case back to Murphy, the judge whose decisions helped precipitate the Supreme Court’s rulings.

Murphy had previously issued injunctions against the deportations to South Sudan, leading to successful appeals from the Trump administration.

Before he transferred the case back to Murphy, however, Judge Moss said it was possible the deportees could prove their case that the Trump administration intended to subject them to abuse.

“It seems to me almost self-evident that the United States government cannot take human beings and send them to circumstances in which their physical wellbeing is at risk simply either to punish them or send a signal to others,” Moss said during the hearing.

Lawyers for the Trump administration, meanwhile, argued that the deportation’s continued delay would strain relations with third countries willing to accept deportees.

Murphy, who denied Friday’s request, had previously ruled in favour of the deportees, issuing an injunction against their removal to South Sudan and saying they had a right to contest the deportation based on fears for their safety.

The Supreme Court first lifted the injunction on June 23 and clarified its ruling again on Thursday, giving a subtle rebuke to Judge Murphy.

The Trump administration has been pushing for rapid removals as part of its campaign of mass deportation, one of President Trump’s signature priorities.

Opponents have accused the administration of steamrolling people’s human rights to achieve its aims, including the right to due process under the law.

But the Trump administration has framed migration as an “invasion” that constitutes a national security crisis, and it argued that its strong-armed efforts are needed to expel criminals.

The eight people slated to be sent to South Sudan, it said, were “barbaric, violent criminal illegal aliens”. It added that they had been found guilty of crimes, including first-degree murder, robbery and sexual assault.

“These sickos will be in South Sudan by Independence Day,” Homeland Security spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a news release on Thursday.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,
762,8,Is Trump using Africa as a ‘dumping ground’ for criminals?,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/7/25/is-trump-using-africa-as-a-dumping-ground-for-criminals,2025-07-25T16:02:32Z,Al Jazeera English,US,mass migration,"Activists and human rights groups have accused United States President Donald Trump of using African countries as a “dumping ground” for criminals he wants to deport after five men were deported from the US to the tiny kingdom of Eswatini.

On July 16, a deportation flight carrying five men from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen, all of whom have been convicted of crimes in the US, landed in Eswatini, the last African country governed by a monarch with absolute power. The deportations were part of Trump’s “third country” plan to deport people whose own countries are unwilling to take them back.

Eswatini is the second African nation that the US has deported criminals to. Also this month, Washington said it had sent eight “uniquely barbaric monsters” to conflict-torn South Sudan.

Last month, the US Supreme Court allowed the deportations of foreign nationals to unrelated third countries. Since then, international rights groups and civil society groups from African nations have raised alarms of human rights abuses.

“The US government sees us as a criminal dumpsite and undermines Emaswati [the people of Eswatini],” Wandile Dludlu, a pro-democracy activist and deputy president of the country’s largest opposition movement, the People’s United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), told Al Jazeera. As a political party, PUDEMO is a banned organisation in Eswatini.

So is Trump planning to use African nations as a “dumping ground” for deportees?

Who are the five men Trump deported to Eswatini?

This month, Tricia McLaughlin, US Department of Homeland Security assistant secretary, said the deportation flight to Eswatini had taken away “individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back”.

“These depraved monsters have been terrorizing American communities but thanks to [Trump] they are off of American soil,” she wrote in a post on X.

NEW: a safe third country deportation flight to Eswatini in Southern Africa has landed— This flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back. These depraved monsters have been terrorizing American communities but thanks to @POTUS… pic.twitter.com/TsanIX8H4T — Tricia McLaughlin (@TriciaOhio) July 16, 2025

Without sharing their names, McLaughlin confirmed the five were nationals from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen.

She said all were convicted criminals – including for offences of child rape, murder, robbery, gang ties and homicides – and had been given prison sentences as long as 25 years.

What agreement has the Trump administration made with Eswatini?

Trump rode to victory in last year’s presidential election on the back of a campaign with mass deportations as its centrepiece.

Since then, the Trump administration has been negotiating a third-country deportation agreement with several nations, including Eswatini, which will allow it to deport foreign nationals convicted of serious crimes who have been rejected by their home countries.

While the exact terms remain classified, the agreement between Eswatini and the US reportedly emerged after “months of robust high-level engagements”, the kingdom’s acting spokesperson, Thabile Mdluli, said.

Mdluli also said the kingdom would collaborate with the White House and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) “to facilitate the transit of these inmates to their countries of origin”.

However, “there are no timelines at present” for their repatriation, she told CNN in an interview.

Daniel Akech, a senior analyst for South Sudan at the International Crisis Group, told Al Jazeera that some African governments are agreeing to receive convicted deportees as a “goodwill gesture, aiming to improve US ties and be in [Trump’s] good books”.

But he said they have also “implicitly dismissed human rights concerns and the lack of transparency on how third nationals’ safety is ensured”.

Akech said the African Union and the United Nations could partner with receiving countries to monitor the process of US deportations “to ensure that the deportees are protected and their living conditions are good”.

“The areas where these deportees stay could face conflicts, and this would require plans on how to ensure their safety or safe transfer within the country or outside,” Akech said.

What do we know about Eswatini?

The mountainous Southern African kingdom is a tiny landlocked nation bordering South Africa and Mozambique and is one of a handful of countries that are still absolute monarchies with absolute power residing with the king, currently King Mswati III.

Under British colonial rule, which ended in 1968, the country was known as Swaziland. It was renamed by the king in 2018.

Mswati has ruled Eswatini since 1986 when he turned 18, succeeding his father, Sobhuza II, who died in 1982.

Now aged 57, Mswati has been criticised for suppressing political dissent. The World Bank said more than half of Eswatini’s 1.2 million people live on less than $4 a day.

The king is reported to have 11 wives, and his wealth is estimated at $200m to $500m, according to an Associated Press report.

Eswatini’s economy is dominated by agriculture and small-scale manufacturing as well as its sugar sector, which accounts for a substantial share of its export revenues. The country is one of Africa’s largest sugar producers, exporting roughly $477m of sugar and sugar-related products in 2023 – about 23 percent of its total exports.

What do people in Eswatini think about Trump’s deportation plan?

Regional leaders and activists said there is a good deal of anger about it.

Dludlu described the “dumping” of convicted criminals as “distasteful and fraudulent conduct by His Majesty and his government in the face of the unprecedented public healthcare crisis” in the country.

“This is attracting indignation from Emaswati for naked abuse of their sovereignty and territorial integrity as a nation and people,” Dludlu told Al Jazeera.

He said PUDEMO and its supporters demand that the government and the US “reverse this absurd and illegal yet irrational decision to take criminals from the US when other nations seek fair trade, quality education and other meaningful exchanges”.

Dludlu further noted that the incoming deportees will only add to the “overcrowded prison facilities that are poorly run [in] dilapidated and outdated infrastructure”. Figures show that prisons in Eswatini operate at more than 170 percent of their capacity.

Civil society groups – including the Southern Africa Litigation Centre, the Swaziland Rural Women’s Assembly and other regional NGOs – have threatened legal proceedings against the Eswatini government over its acceptance of the five convicted criminals.

They argued that the detentions violate Eswatini’s own Correctional Services Act and other domestic laws and said there is no lawful basis for imprisoning foreign nationals who lack legal ties to the country.

Chris Ogunmodede, a foreign affairs analyst familiar with African diplomatic circles, said there are several questions hovering over the agreement made with the Trump administration. These range from the legal justification used to authorise the deportees’ transfers, whether the men were informed and given consular access, the duration of their detentions and the terms of the arrangement with the US.

He added that Eswatini and South Sudan are “smaller economies with no geopolitical weight” on which White House officials could easily “impose their will”.

What does the Eswatini government say?

In a public statement, Mdluli said the government assured the people of the kingdom that the arrival of five third-country deportees from the US “poses no security threat to the Nation”.

It stated that the five prisoners would be housed in correctional facilities within isolated units “where similar offenders are kept”.

Addressing the bilateral discussions with the White House, she said the “engagements considered every avenue, including rigorous risk assessments and careful consideration for the safety and security of citizens”.

Which other African nations does Trump hope to negotiate deportation deals with?

In addition to Eswatini and South Sudan, Trump has discussed third-country deportation deals with the leaders of Liberia, Senegal, Guinea-Bissau, Mauritania and Gabon during a summit at the White House this month.

Trump reportedly discussed migration, including the need for countries to accept the return of their nationals who do not have the right to stay in the US and the possibility of accepting deported citizens of third countries.

Tom Homan, Trump’s border tsar, said the Trump administration hoped to forge deals with “many countries” to accept deported migrants.

“If there is a significant public threat or national security threat, there’s one thing for sure: They’re not walking the streets of this country. We’ll find a third, safe nation to send them to, and we’re doing it,” he said.

Rwanda has confirmed it is in talks with the Trump administration for a similar deal while Nigeria said it had rejected pressure to make an agreement.

Which other countries have considered a third-country deportation policy?

United Kingdom

The UK has explored third-country deportation policies as part of its efforts to manage irregular migration and asylum claims. Under the previous Conservative government, the UK partnered with Rwanda in 2022 and planned to relocate asylum seekers to Rwanda for processing with the UK committing 370 million pounds ($497m) in development funding over five years in exchange.

The plan was first struck down by the UK Supreme Court in November 2023 for violating international human rights norms, given Rwanda’s inadequate asylum system and human rights concerns. In response, the government enacted the Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Act 2024, which declared Rwanda a “safe country” and limited legal challenges to the policy.

After the Labour Party’s victory in the July 2024 elections, Prime Minister Keir Starmer swiftly terminated the Rwanda scheme.

However, in May, Starmer said he was talking to “a number of countries” about “return hubs”, where undocumented immigrants could be sent.

Israel

Similarly, Israel implemented a third-country deportation arrangement targeting African asylum seekers by sending them to countries like Rwanda and Uganda from 2013 to 2018.

The government offered $3,500 per person to those agreeing to leave.

In 2018, however, Israel’s Supreme Court in effect dismantled the policy, ruling it unlawful in part due to the receiving countries’ failure to guarantee protections and uphold international obligations under the Refugee Convention.

Ogunmodede said the UK’s and Israel’s deals with African nations amounted to the “outsourcing of the migration problem”.

Bidders will be evaluated, graded and then tanked for suitability

Other regions are also modernizing tech stacks

The Iranian government is apparently seeking cloud computing suppliers as it bids to rebuild its tech stack.

The nation has announced plans to evaluate, grade and rank cloud providers to determine which would be the best suit for hosting key government services, with plans to form a panel of at least three qualified cloud operators deemed fit for purpose.

The Information Technology Organization of Iran (ITOI) is now set to assess potential cloud providers based on three different standards – ISO 27017 (cloud security controls), ISO 27018 (protection of personally identifiable information), and NIST SP 900-145, which relates to US cloud computing definition.

Iran is welcoming bids for its next big cloud provider

Iran's adoption of NIST standards might be surprising given the country's ongoing tensions with the US, but its recognition of these well-regarded standards is good news for the security of citizens' data.

ITOI is now inviting providers offering IaaS, PaaS or SaaS, as well as private, public, hybrid or community cloud models.

Services like security, monitoring, support and cloud migration are also being welcomed under the new scheme, with successful candidates to be awarded a cloud service rating certificate, ultimately leading them to be listed as authorized providers that could be in for a chance of major Iranian government contracts.

However, the process might not be so simple for the Iran – many countries have made it illegal to do business with Iran, or have imposed major restrictions.

Nevertheless, Iran's efforts to modernize its tech stack reflects an ongoing trend across the world, with many other regions looking to diversify. European countries are beginning to seek local or open-source alternatives to the likes of Microsoft, while the US government continues to drive forward a scheme designed to save considerable cash on IT contracts via centralized, mass purchasing.

toggle caption NASA TV/NASA

The Trump administration has asked NASA employees to draw up plans to end at least two major satellite missions, according to current and former NASA staffers. If the plans are carried out, one of the missions would be permanently terminated, because the satellite would burn up in the atmosphere.

The data the two missions collect is widely used, including by scientists, oil and gas companies and farmers who need detailed information about carbon dioxide and crop health. They are the only two federal satellite missions that were designed and built specifically to monitor planet-warming greenhouse gases.

Sponsor Message

It is unclear why the Trump administration seeks to end the missions. The equipment in space is state of the art and is expected to function for many more years, according to scientists who worked on the missions. An official review by NASA in 2023 found that ""the data are of exceptionally high quality"" and recommended continuing the mission for at least three years.

Both missions, known as the Orbiting Carbon Observatories, measure carbon dioxide and plant growth around the globe. They use identical measurement devices, but one device is attached to a stand-alone satellite while the other is attached to the International Space Station. The standalone satellite would burn up in the atmosphere if NASA pursued plans to terminate the mission.

NASA employees who work on the two missions are making what the agency calls Phase F plans for both carbon-monitoring missions, according to David Crisp, a longtime NASA scientist who designed the instruments and managed the missions until he retired in 2022. Phase F plans lay out options for terminating NASA missions.

Crisp says NASA employees making those termination plans have reached out to him for his technical expertise. ""What I have heard is direct communications from people who were making those plans, who weren't allowed to tell me that that's what they were told to do. But they were allowed to ask me questions,"" Crisp says. ""They were asking me very sharp questions. The only thing that would have motivated those questions was [that] somebody told them to come up with a termination plan.""

Three other academic scientists who use data from the missions confirmed that they, too, have been contacted with questions related to mission termination. All three asked for anonymity because they are concerned that speaking about the mission termination plans publicly could endanger the jobs of the NASA employees who contacted them.

Two current NASA employees also confirmed that NASA mission leaders were told to make termination plans for projects that would lose funding under President Trump's proposed budget for the next fiscal year, or FY 2026, which begins Oct. 1. The employees asked to remain anonymous, because they were told they would be fired if they revealed the request.

Congress funded the missions and may fund them again

Presidential budget proposals are wish lists that often bear little resemblance to final congressional budgets. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory missions have already received funding from Congress through the end of the 2025 fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. Draft budgets that Congress is currently considering for next year keep NASA funding basically flat. But it's not clear whether these specific missions will receive funding again, or if Congress will pass a budget before current funding expires on Sept. 30.

Last week, NASA announced it will consider proposals from private companies and universities that are willing to take on the cost of maintaining the device that is attached to the International Space Station, as well as another device that measures ozone in the atmosphere.

NASA did not respond to questions from NPR about whether other missions will also be privatized, or about why the agency is making plans to potentially terminate projects that may receive funding in Congress' next budget.

In July, congressional Democrats sent a letter to acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy warning his agency not to terminate missions that Congress has funded, and arguing that the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and its director, Russ Vought, are overstepping by directing NASA and other agencies to stop spending money that Congress has already appropriated.

Sponsor Message

""Congress has the power of the purse, not Trump or Vought,"" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., one of the authors of the letter and the ranking Democrat on the House Committee on Science, Space and Technology in an email to NPR. ""Eliminating funds or scaling down the operations of Earth-observing satellites would be catastrophic and would severely impair our ability to forecast, manage, and respond to severe weather and climate disasters. The Trump administration is forcing the proposed cuts in its FY26 budget request on already appropriated FY25 funds. This is illegal.""

A spokesperson for OMB told NPR via email that ""OMB had nothing to do with NASA Earth Science leadership's request for termination plans."" The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy did not respond to questions from NPR.

In the past, Vought has been vocal about cutting what he sees as inappropriate spending on projects related to climate change. Before he joined the Trump administration, Vought authored sections of the Heritage Foundation's Project 2025 roadmap for remaking the federal government. In that document, Vought wrote that ""the Biden Administration's climate fanaticism will need a whole-of-government unwinding"" and argued that federal regulators should make it easier for commercial satellites to be launched.

The data from these missions is even more valuable than intended

The missions are called Orbiting Carbon Observatories because they were originally designed to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. But soon after they launched, scientists realized that they were also accidentally measuring plant growth on Earth.

Basically, when plants are growing, photosynthesis is happening in their cells. And that photosynthesis gives off a very specific wavelength of light. The OCO instruments in space measure that light all over the planet.

""NASA and others have turned this happy accident into an incredibly valuable set of maps of plant photosynthesis around the world,"" explains Scott Denning, a longtime climate scientist at Colorado State University who worked on the OCO missions and is now retired. ""Lo and behold, we also get these lovely, high resolution maps of plant growth,"" he says. ""And that's useful to farmers, useful to rangeland and grazing and drought monitoring and forest mapping and all kinds of things, in addition to the CO2 measurements.""

For example, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and many private agricultural consulting companies use the data to forecast and track crop yield, drought conditions and more.

The information can also help predict future political instability, since crop failures are a major driver of mass migration all over the world. For example, persistent drought in Honduras is one factor that has led many farmers there to migrate north, NPR reporting found. And damage to crops and livestock from extreme weather in Northern Africa has contributed to migration from that region. ""This is a national security issue, for sure,"" Crisp says.

Carbon-monitoring satellites have revolutionized climate science

The carbon dioxide data that the instruments were originally designed to collect has revolutionized scientists' understanding of how quickly carbon dioxide is collecting in the atmosphere.

That's because measuring carbon dioxide with instruments in various locations on the Earth's surface, as scientists have been doing since the 1950s, doesn't provide information about the whole planet. Satellite data, on the other hand, covers the entire Earth.

And that data showed some surprising things. ""Fifty years ago we thought the tropical forests were like a huge vacuum cleaner, sucking up carbon dioxide,"" Denning explains. ""Now we know they're not.""

Instead, boreal forests in the northern latitudes suck up a significant amount of carbon dioxide, the satellite data shows. And the patterns of which areas absorb the planet-warming gas, and how much they absorb, are continuously changing as the climate changes.

""The value of these observations is just increasing over time,"" explains Anna Michalak, a climate researcher at Carnegie Science and Stanford University who has worked extensively on greenhouse gas monitoring from space. ""These are missions that are still providing critical information.""

It is expensive to end satellite missions

The cost of maintaining the two OCO satellite missions up in space is a small fraction of the amount of money taxpayers already spent to design and launch the instruments. The two missions cost about $750 million to design, build and launch, according to David Crisp, the retired NASA scientist, and that number is even higher if you include the cost of an initial failed rocket launch that sent an identical carbon dioxide measuring instrument into the ocean in 2009.

Sponsor Message

By comparison, maintaining both OCO missions in orbit costs about $15 million per year, Crisp says. That money covers the cost of downloading the data, maintaining a network of calibration sensors on the ground and making sure the stand-alone satellite isn't hit by space debris, according to Crisp.

""Just from an economic standpoint, it makes no economic sense to terminate NASA missions that are returning incredibly valuable data,"" Crisp says.

NASA's recent call for universities and companies to potentially take over the cost of maintaining the OCO instrument attached to the International Space Station suggests the agency is also considering privatizing NASA science missions. Such partnerships raise a host of thorny questions, says Michalak, who has worked with private companies, nonprofit groups, universities and the federal government on greenhouse gas monitoring satellite projects.

""On the one hand the private sector is really starting to have a role,"" Michalak says. In recent years, multiple private groups in the U.S. have launched satellites that measure methane, a potent planet-warming gas that is poorly monitored compared to carbon dioxide.

""Looking at it from the outside, it can look like the private sector is really picking up some of what the federal agencies were doing in terms of Earth observations,"" she explains. ""And it's true that they're contributing."" But, she says, ""Those efforts would not be possible without this underlying investment from public funding.""

Rather than address the concerns of the public, such as removing the mostly young male illegal migrants from the taxpayer-funded hotel accommodations in communities across the country, the UK Home Office has formed the National Internet Intelligence Investigations to “maximise social media intelligence” about anti-mass migration sentiment on social media, according to The Telegraph.

The team will work out of the Covid lockdown-enforcing National Police Coordination Centre (NPoCC) in London.

It comes amid protests outside of migrant hotels, starting with the Bell Hotel in Epping, where locals have staged several protests after an illegal from Ethiopia was accused of sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl from the area. Protests against planned migrant hotels have also broken out in Norfolk and London.

While mostly peaceful, the government is reportedly deeply concerned of a potential re-run of last summer’s riots, which broke out in the wake of a second-generation Rwandan teen, Axel Rudakubana, stabbing three young girls to death and injuring ten others at a children’s dance party in Southport. Anger over the horrific attack sparked protests and riots across the UK, during which migrant hotels were targeted in violent incidents.

The government took a hard-line approach to what Prime Minsiter Starmer branded as “far-right” outpouring of anger, arresting over 1,280 people, including some who merely posted on social media, such as Lucy Connolly, a mother who received a 31-month prison sentence for a Facebook comment in relation to the riots.

Nevertheless, the government has vowed an even stronger response to any unrest this year. A government spokesman told the Independent: “While the public have a right to protest against the current situation, we will never tolerate unlawful or violent behaviour.

“Working closely with the police, we have thorough and well-tested contingency plans in place to deal with any public disorder, which have been strengthened since last year’s shameful scenes.”

Meanwhile, the Online Safety Act, which was passed by the former Conservative Party government and finalised by Labour, came into effect for social media companies on Friday. While the legislation was pitched to the public as a means of preventing children from seeing pornography or other graphic content, X users in Britain have already reported having anti-mass migration protest footage blocked if it contains any violence.

The move by the government to establish a new team to monitor social media has drawn strong rebuke from opponents, including from Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who said: “This is the beginning of the state controlling free speech. It is sinister, dangerous and must be fought. Reform UK will do just that.”

Conservative Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp remarked: “Two-tier Keir can’t police the streets, so he’s trying to police opinions instead. They’re setting up a central team to monitor what you post, what you share, what you think, because deep down they know the public don’t buy what they’re selling.

United Kingdom Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was hosted as a guest — in his own country — by U.S. President Donald Trump at his Scottish golf courses and country house on Monday. While Starmer and the attendant media were constantly reminded by Trump how much he likes his British counterpart, the laid-on flattery was quickly recognised by observers as the velvet glove cloaking an iron fist intent on rattling a left-wing government dragging Britain down.

Riffing off press questions, Trump made abundantly clear with cocked eye and body language alone his inner thoughts on the UK government’s assault on freedom of speech, expression, faith, and information. Later, President Trump sat beside Starmer and offered fatherly advice on how to win elections, rattling through a list of policies popular with ordinary people that amounts to a total repudiation of everything the UK leader’s left-wing Labour Party stands for.

President Trump said “you know, politics is pretty simple… generally speaking the one who cuts taxes the most, the one who gives you the lowest energy prices, the best kind of energy, the one who keeps you out of wars… stop the crime, and in your case a big immigration component” can be sure to win elections.

Punishing as having to sit through this was for Starmer, the cameras of the world media focusing on Starmer looking into the middle distance with an apparently vacant expression, the UK’s other political leaders also caught a little flak. Making an accurate assessment that British politics has resolved into a two-party game between Starmer’s Labour and Nigel Farage’s Reform UK — “I assume there’s a thing going on between you and Nigel, and that’s OK, it’s two parties” — Trump handily dismissed the existence of the Conservative Party and the rest.

The default party of government in Britain for two centuries, the Conservatives spent their last 14 years in power piling up taxes and throwing the nation’s borders wide open, precisely the opposite of the Trump victory strategy as expressed.

And the pressure piled on further on Tuesday, with the firmest hint yet from Trump to the United Kingdom that all is not going as well as it could. Soaring energy prices have been a major political issue for the United Kingdom for years, as the global economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine sent natural gas prices soaring, leaving the United Kingdom scrambling. Despite sitting on vast energy reserves under the North Sea and with shale gas underground, the UK’s left-wing government refuses to drill, being so wedded to its green ideals..

Waking up in Scotland on Tuesday morning, President Trump took to Truth Social and blasted Starmer: “North Sea Oil is a TREASURE CHEST for the United Kingdom.

“The taxes are so high, however, that it makes no sense. They have essentially told drillers and oil companies that, ‘we don’t want you.’ Incentivize the drillers, FAST. A VAST FORTUNE TO BE MADE for the UK, and far lower energy costs for the people!”.

Sir Keir could perhaps have taken solace in his strength as a leader, letting the words of the U.S. President wash over him had he won a thumping electoral victory, or if he was riding high in the polls. As it is, Starmer won a loveless victory at the ballot box last year, getting fewer votes than an election loser in normal times and being propelled into power only through the collapse of the previous government.

That’s pretty standard procedure, except for one catch that The Intercept picked up on: the description of the project basically only fits the work of Palmer Luckey’s Anduril Industries.

The provision in question calls for $6 billion to be spent on border security technologies, including a “virtual wall” of surveillance towers that can detect people crossing the border. The bill says the payday can only be awarded to a company whose products have been “tested and accepted by U.S. Customs and Border Protection to deliver autonomous capabilities”—where “autonomous” is described as “a system designed to apply artificial intelligence, machine learning, computer vision, or other algorithms to accurately detect, identify, classify, and track items of interest in real time such that the system can make operational adjustments without the active engagement of personnel or continuous human command or control.”

That pretty much exclusively describes the work of Anduril, which suddenly has an effective monopoly on the very lucrative surveillance tower business. The Intercept reports that a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson confirmed that Anduril is the only company currently approved to fulfill the contract, just as Homeland Security seems set to order hundreds of new towers to be built in the coming years. Isn’t that just serendipitous timing!

You might consider the narrowly defined contract a little kickback to Anduril CEO Palmer Luckey, a longtime Trump backer who has been putting money in his campaign coffers dating back to 2016. He also hosted a fundraiser for Trump in 2020 and laid the groundwork for other Trump-curious tech CEOs, including Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, to make their rightward shift in 2024.

Luckey and Andruil have really been digging their claws into all available military funding since the start of Trump’s second term. Earlier this year, the company took over Microsoft’s multi-billion dollar contract to build the Integrated Visual Augmentation System (IVAS), an augmented reality headset for use by the US Army. Luckey also teamed back up with an old frenemy, the increasingly Trumpian Mark Zuckerberg, to collaborate on a project to develop AR and VR technology for the U.S. military, including a system that could detect enemy soldiers or drones.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,

The scheme will be rolled out across member nations over six months, meaning it will not be fully implemented until 10 April 2026.

The Entry/Exit System (EES) will replace the current paper checks and will mean passengers from the UK will need to have their fingerprints and faces scanned to cross an EU border.

Stamps in people's passports will be replaced by biometric checks for people travelling in and out of the EU from 12 October, officials have confirmed.

Under the new system, non-EU citizens, including people from the UK, will need to register their biometric data along with their passport details to enter an EU country.

Anyone who refuses to provide the biometric data will be denied entry into the EU.

Currently, travellers have to present their passport to a border official to be checked and stamped.

The data will be collected at the point of departure - either at an airport, port or train station - where there will be dedicated booths for scanning fingerprints and taking a photo.

This record will then be valid for three years and means on later trips border officers will only need to verify a person's biometrics, which the EU hopes will take less time. People with ePassports will also be able to use e-gates.

There is no cost for EES registration.

For most tourists, digital records will only be held for three years and a day - but for those who overstay the 90-day limit without a visa will have their data held for five years.

The system aims to tighten border security but has raised concerns of long queues. The UK government has warned travellers to ""be prepared to wait during busy times"" when the scheme begins, as the checks will take several minutes to complete.

However, the EU has said that, once implemented, the EES will shorten waits at the border by enabling faster checks and allowing passengers to provide their information in advance.

Since the UK left the EU, airports at many popular European holiday destinations have seen long queues of British travellers as their passports have required checking and stamping.

There have also been long queues at the Eurotunnel, and the new system sparked concerns that waiting times for people travelling to and from France by car would only be exacerbated by the new system.

Passengers will be given hand-held devices to register in their cars, while French border checks have been implemented on British soil at the Port of Dover, the Eurotunnel's Folkestone end and Eurostar's St Pancras terminal.

In May, the UK and EU struck a deal which allowed for UK nationals to use EU e-gates - but only after the EES is introduced.

""Once the EES is in place, UK nationals will therefore be able to use e-gates where they are available, provided they are registered in the system,"" an EU Commission spokesperson told the BBC at the time.

toggle caption Royal Thai Army/AP

BANGKOK — Thailand and Cambodia exchanged fire on their border Thursday in a sharp escalation of their conflict that killed at least nine civilians.

Both nations accused each other of starting the military clashes and have downgraded their diplomatic relations since Wednesday. Thailand also sealed all land border crossings with Cambodia. Relations between the Southeast Asian neighbors have deteriorated sharply since an armed confrontation in May that killed a Cambodian soldier. Nationalist passions on both sides have further inflamed the situation.

The Thai army said the most casualties occurred in Si Sa Ket province, where six people were killed after shots were fired at a gas station. At least 14 people were injured in three border provinces.

The Thai army said it launched airstrikes Thursday on ground military targets in Cambodia, while the Cambodian Defense Ministry said the Thai jets dropped bombs on a road near the ancient Preah Vihear temple.

Both governments say they have to respond to the other's actions

Clashes are ongoing in at least six areas along the border, Thai Defense Ministry spokesperson Surasant Kongsiri said. The first clash Thursday morning happened in an area near the ancient Ta Muen Thom temple along the border of Thailand's Surin province and Cambodia's Oddar Meanchey province.

A livestream video from Thailand's side showed people running from their homes and hiding in a concrete bunker Thursday morning as explosions sounded.

Thailand's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said Cambodia has attacked both military and non-military sites in Thailand, including a hospital.

""The Royal Thai Government calls upon Cambodia to take responsibility for the incidents that have occurred, cease attacks against civilian and military targets, and stop all actions that violate Thailand's sovereignty. The Royal Thai Government is prepared to intensify our self-defense measures if Cambodia persists in its armed attack and violations upon Thailand's sovereignty in accordance with international law and principles,"" said Nikorndej Balankura, the ministry's spokesperson.

Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Manet said his country has always maintained a position of peaceful resolution of problems, but ""we have no choice but to respond with armed force against armed aggression.""

Ambassadors are withdrawn and borders closed

Earlier Thursday, Cambodia said it was downgrading diplomatic relations with Thailand to their lowest level, expelling the Thai ambassador and recalling all Cambodian staff from its embassy in Bangkok. That was in response to Thailand withdrawing its ambassador and expelling the Cambodian ambassador Wednesday to protest a land mine blast that wounded five Thai soldiers.

The Thai army said of Thursday's initial clash that its forces heard an unmanned aerial vehicle before seeing six armed Cambodian soldiers moving closer to Thailand's station. It said Thai soldiers tried to shout at them to defuse the situation but the Cambodian side started to open fire.

Cambodia's Defense Ministry also said Thailand employed a drone first before opening fire, and that Cambodia ""acted strictly within the bounds of self-defense, responding to an unprovoked incursion by Thai troops that violated our territorial integrity.""

The Thai embassy in Phnom Penh posted on Facebook that there were clashes at several border areas that could continue to escalate. It urged Thai nationals in Cambodia to leave the country if they could and advised others not to travel to Cambodia unless absolutely necessary.

On Wednesday, a land mine blast near the border wounded five Thai soldiers, one of whom lost a leg. A week earlier, a land mine in a different contested area exploded and wounded three Thai soldiers when one of them stepped on it and lost a foot.

Thai authorities have alleged the mines were newly laid along paths that by mutual agreement were supposed to be safe. They said the mines were Russian-made and not of a type employed by Thailand's military. Cambodia rejected Thailand's account as ""baseless accusations,"" pointing out that many unexploded mines and other ordnance are a legacy of 20th century wars and unrest.

The border dispute has also caused political fallout in Thailand, whose prime minister was suspended from office to be investigated for possible ethics violations over the matter.

Border disputes are longstanding issues that have caused periodic tensions between the countries. The most prominent and violent conflicts have been around the 1,000-year-old Preah Vihear temple.

In 1962, the International Court of Justice recognized Cambodian sovereignty over the temple area in a ruling that became a major irritant in the relations of both countries.

NATO is set to boost its air defense along its eastern flank with Dutch and Norwegian F-35 fighter jets scheduled to patrol Polish skies from September through early December.

The mission, announced by the Dutch Ministry of Defence, aims to secure key supply lines into Ukraine and deter Russian activity near allied territory.

This will be the first time fifth-generation F-35s operate from Poland under direct NATO command — an upgrade from previous missions that used older aircraft like the F-16 or Eurofighter.

According to Jamie Shea, former NATO Deputy Assistant Secretary General for Emerging Security Challenges, the shift is both symbolic and strategic.

""The F-35s represent a much greater military capability for air defense and intelligence gathering — especially at a moment when Russia is sending as many as 700 drones and ballistic missiles a night against targets in Ukraine,"" Shea told Business Insider.

The deployment will run as a 24/7 quick reaction alert, with Dutch and Norwegian personnel operating jointly under NATO control. It followed a request from NATO's Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe, prompted by intensifying Russian strikes near the Polish-Ukrainian border.

Russia has increasingly targeted infrastructure in western Ukraine, including areas near Lutsk and Ternopil, where Western aid and weapons often enter.

""As Russia goes closer to the Polish border, there is the danger of more Russian drones and missiles landing inside Poland itself,"" Shea said.

The mission reinforces — but doesn't replace — Poland's existing air defenses.

While NATO F-35s have previously flown over Estonia, the upcoming operation in Poland stands out for its length and multinational framework. The six-month deployment is among the longest for NATO F-35s and introduces a shared operational structure.

""A six-month deployment is a significant commitment by Norway and the Netherlands,"" Shea said. ""Usually, F-35 deployments last only a few days during exercises.""

He also said it's novel that two countries are sharing this mission together, ""which enhances their technical interoperability and ability to work jointly, not only with each other but also with the Polish Air Force.""

He called the mission a prime example of the defense integration Europe needs in response to Russia's attack on Ukraine, melding top-tier equipment and coordination.

Andrew A. Michta, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's GeoStrategy Initiative, said the deployment ""signals both the growing realization at NATO that the threat from Russia to the alliance itself is real and growing. It also marks an important step in addressing the question of force posture.""

Michta noted that most long-standing US military bases in Europe are still in Germany, the Cold War's frontline. ""Today, Poland plays the same role,"" he said, ""the key hub of NATO defenses in the East and the center of the Northeast Corridor.""

""Poland is also the critical transit route for aiding Ukraine,"" Michta added. ""Deploying the F35 should shore up deterrence on the flank and send a message to Moscow about our continued commitment to Ukraine.""

A critical moment for Poland

The mission also comes at a critical time for Poland, which faces mounting air-defense pressure. The Polish Air Force has just 48 F-16s, with newly purchased FA-50s from South Korea now entering service.

Michał Piekarski, a defense analyst at the University of Wrocław, stressed the persistent risk near NATO's airspace.

""The airspace of Poland, as well as other countries on the Eastern Flank of NATO, is constantly threatened by Russian activities,"" he told BI. ""On a regular basis, Russian large-scale missile and drone strikes against Ukraine create a risk that stray missiles or drones may enter NATO airspace.""

He added that NATO aircraft are already a presence during these strikes, and that the F-35s will ""greatly support our fighters.""

Piekarski also warned of another danger: the vulnerability of Polish infrastructure near the Ukrainian border.

This could come in the form of a deliberate — or masqueraded as accidental — Russian attack on Polish logistical hubs like airports, railway freight stations, or gas and petroleum infrastructure, he said.

""Credible deterrence is required if we want this hypothetical scenario to remain a hypothesis, not reality,"" he added.

With Poland still awaiting delivery of its own F-35s, joint training with experienced NATO partners is also crucial.

Warsaw ordered 32 F-35A aircraft from US manufacturer Lockheed Martin in 2020, and is set to receive the first ones in 2026.

""Any opportunity for joint training and better understanding of the capabilities that F-35s do have is highly valuable for our armed forces,"" Piekarski said.

Ukraine watching on

Hanna Hopko, the former head of Ukraine's parliamentary foreign affairs committee, told BI that ""the upcoming deployment of Dutch and Norwegian F-35s to Poland is a crucial step toward strengthening NATO's deterrence posture and protecting the critical lifelines that support Ukraine's defense.""

She called it part of a broader recognition of Russia's wider threat.

""The security of the European continent is inseparable from the security of the skies over Ukraine and NATO's eastern flank,"" Hopko added. ""Especially for member states sharing borders with Russia.""

But she said that more needs to be done.

""Now it must be scaled up — not just to protect supply corridors but also to shield critical infrastructure like Ukraine's nuclear power plants,"" she said, adding: ""Democracies must act together to defend the rules-based order and the future security of the continent.""",NewsAPI,-4.05,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,40.61,"business insider, Business Insider, Insider, businessinsider.com, insider.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/,https://ground.news/interest/business-insider,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/insider-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.3),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Axel Springer SE,2007,-1.46,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,businessinsider.com,,business insider,20,USA,,,,
773,31,"After watching Ukraine, Russia's NATO neighbors are betting big on US-made HIMARS rocket artillery",https://www.businessinsider.com/russias-nato-neighbors-going-all-in-on-us-made-himars-2025-7,2025-07-10T09:23:01Z,Business Insider,US,border,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.

NATO allies sharing a border with Russia are turning to the US-made High Mobility Artillery Rocket System as they arm themselves for the possibility of Russian aggression.

The HIMARS, made by US defense giant Lockheed Martin, is a multiple rocket launcher. Ukraine has been using it as part of its fight against Russia's invasion. Though a game changer when first introduced, the system's effectiveness has diminished. Still, it's considered a necessary capability by Russia's neighbors.

The three Baltic countries are concerned that Russia could attack them next after Ukraine. Boosting their defenses, they have selected the HIMARS as a key weapon.

Estonia received six HIMARS in April, Latvia has an agreement with the US for six of the systems, expected by 2027, and Lithuania is purchasing eight of them, with the first deliveries expected this year.

These countries see the deep strike capability as critical based on watching Ukraine. Hanno Pevkur, Estonia's defense minister, explained to Business Insider that his country believes the combat-tested HIMARS send a ""deterrence message"" to Russia.

""We have the long strike capability, deep strike capability in Estonia already today,"" he said.

Ukraine shows the need

Beyond lessons on the importance of maintaining robust air defenses, deep ammunition stockpiles, and strong electronic warfare capabilities, the war in Ukraine has shown that the ability to strike deep behind enemy lines or into hostile territory is essential, Pevkur said. The HIMARS deliver that capability.

When Ukraine first received HIMARS from the US, Russian ammo depots, command and control centers, and more that had been out of reach of Ukrainian artillery were suddenly vulnerable. The Guided Multiple Launch Rocket System had the reach needed to strike critical Russian targets. These surface-to-surface rockets have a range of around 70 kilometers, and Ukraine put them to use battering tactically significant Russian targets.

Specifically, Ukraine has used the weapons to strike Russian troops , ammunition depots , and aircraft.

Ukraine later received Army Tactical Missile Systems with significantly longer range but was initially barred from striking into Russia, leaving Russian forces free to mass troops and weaponry in a safe haven. By the time those restrictions were lifted, Ukraine lacked a sufficient supply of them to properly prosecute Russian targets using those missiles.

Ukraine's deep strike campaign has largely depended on homemade drones and anti-ship missiles modified for land attack. The HIMARS served Ukraine well but had far greater potential. In a war with Russia, NATO allies wouldn't have to fight with one hand tied behind their backs as Ukraine often has and would be able to use the weapon as intended.

HIMARS were among the first big weapons the West trusted Ukraine to receive. Their effective use in battle opened the door to more substantial military aid, including armored fighting vehicles, tanks, and even fighter aircraft like American-made F-16s and French Mirages.

HIMARS have become less effective in Ukraine over time as Russia's electronic warfare capabilities have improved. But Justin Bronk, a warfare expert at RUSI, told BI earlier this year that the weapon was ""still an important part of the Ukrainian capabilities.""

Ukraine often hasn't had the launcher or ammunition numbers it needs to be as effective as it could be, an issue complicated by US flip-flopping on support, but the value is nonetheless clear, which explains interest from the Baltic nations.

Ukraine's international partners are watching the war closely to see not just what Ukraine needs, but what they need, in terms of tactics and weaponry, to be ready for a possible war with Russia.

Protecting NATO

The Baltic countries are among the most vocal countries in Europe about the Russian threat given their proximity, but they are not alone. A host of nations, including the UK, Germany, France, Finland, and Denmark, have all warned that Russia could attack.

Former CIA director David Petraeus warned earlier this year that Lithuania is the most likely NATO country to be invaded.

NATO's collective defense clause means that an attack on any one country is an attack on the alliance. A Russian invasion of an alliance member could quickly spiral into a major conflict.

Allies have invested resources like troops and weaponry in those front-line countries, with the head of NATO calling them and neighboring Poland ""a first line of defense"" in May. A Russian advance would ideally be stopped there, but those countries may only be able to slow it down.

Pevkur said it's important for all of NATO to help the region: ""The eastern flank is the front door of NATO, so we need to keep it closed.""

Allies, including the US, also have troops in the Baltic states, and allied F-35s are often deployed there as part of NATO's Baltic Air Policing mission.

The Baltic countries have also taken strong action themselves, not merely relying on more powerful countries for protection. They spend among the highest in NATO on defense as a proportion of their GDP and lead calls for the alliance to massively increase spending.

Their resources have not just been going into HIMARS. They are also buying missiles, howitzers, air defense systems, ammunition, and other weaponry.

Many of their choices have been informed by the way Russia is fighting and what is working for Ukraine. Vaidotas Urbelis, the policy director of Lithuania's defense ministry, told BI last year that his military was buying tanks for the first time in its history because this war had shown them to be important. Tanks have faced serious challenges in this war, but they still have a role.

It's a constant process to figure out what is needed from a rapidly changing battlefield and shifting alliances, with the US pulling away from its longstanding support for Europe.

Pevkur was asked in May if it was wise to rely on US weaponry like HIMARS, given US relations. He said Estonia was considering getting more HIMARS as well as alternatives to the system and alluded to problems with getting enough ammunition for HIMARS.

""If we choose HIMARS, we need to be certain that the system can be fully operational and that the necessary ammunition will be available,"" he said.

The plane went down in a remote wooded area 16km from Tynda airport

Amur's regional governor Vasily Orlov said five children were among those on board and declared three days of mourning.

A Russian civil aviation helicopter then spotted burning fuselage from the plane on a remote hillside about 16km (10 miles) from Tynda.

The Antonov An-24 plane, carrying 42 passengers and six crew, had left Blagoveshchensk close to the Chinese border and vanished from radar screens as it approached Tynda airport, officials said.

Russian officials say 48 people were killed when an Angara Airlines plane went down in a dense forest in the far-eastern Amur region.

The remote, swampy nature of the area meant that rescuers took about an hour to reach the scene.

Preliminary inquiries are looking at either pilot error in poor weather conditions or technical malfunction, according to emergency officials.

The An-24 plane had been on the final leg of a route from Khabarovsk in the far south-east of Russia.

There was low cloud at the time of the crash, and the plane had already made a failed attempt to land at the airport, emergency services said. Radar contact was lost while the crew was preparing for a second approach, they added.

Angara Airlines is based in the Irkutsk region of Siberia and the crew all came from the Irkutsk region. A number of the passengers were working for Russian Railways in the far east.

The Antonov 24 plane was almost 50 years old and originally designed in Kyiv during the Soviet era, although this model has not been used in Ukraine for several years.

Officials said the plane had passed a recent technical inspection, but the civil aviation authority told news agencies it had been involved in four incidents since 2018.

Seven years ago its left wing had been damaged when the plane overran a runway and hit a lightning mast, Tass news agency said.

Other An-24 planes have been involved in fatal crashes, too.

An An-24RV veered off the runway as it landed at Nizhneangarsk Airport in July 2019. Two members of the flight crew were killed.

In 2011, another Angara An-24 crashed into the Ob river in Siberia, killing seven passengers.

""China is willing to uphold an objective and fair position and play a constructive role for the harmonious coexistence between Thailand and Cambodia,"" Wang said.

Tension has risen between the Southeast Asian neighbours since the end of May, after a Cambodian soldier was killed in a brief exchange of gunfire at a disputed area on their 820-km (510-mile) border.

Last month Cambodia asked the International Court of Justice to resolve the disputes.

Wang reiterated China's impartiality on the border issue in a meeting with Cambodian Foreign Minister Prak Sokhonn the same day, the ministry said in a separate summary.

He emphasised security measures to protect Chinese and Cambodians, calling for tougher action to ""completely eradicate the tumour"" of cross-border crimes such as online gambling, wire fraud, counterfeiting and smuggling.

Referring to U.S. tariffs, he added that China believed Southeast Asia had the ability to cope with the ""complex situation"" and safeguard common interests as well as those of individual nations.

Aqara’s successor to the popular G4 video doorbell is now available to buy. The $129.99 G410, announced in January, remains one of the few (only?) doorbells to support Apple’s HomeKit Secure Video and both wireless and hardwired installations, while adding an absolute ton of new features to make it one of the most capable video doorbells on the market that doesn’t require a subscription. It also functions as a multi-protocol hub that can help smart homes easily transition to Matter.

The Aqara G410 adds 2K video in a 4:3 aspect ratio with a wide, 175-degree field of view and end-to-end encryption of live and recorded videos. It’s fitted with dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and Thread radios. That means it can function as an Aqara hub, Thread border router, and Matter controller that supports Aqara’s full range of Zigbee accessories and the increasingly long list of third-party Matter-over-Thread and Matter-over-Wi-Fi devices sold by Aqara and even Ikea soon.

It’s also one of the first doorbells to feature a mmWave sensor to more accurately identify the presence of people, with on-device facial recognition to trigger notifications or automations. Advanced Matter Bridging allows it to share facial recognition with Matter platforms like Home Assistant for even more automation possibilities.

You can send the G410’s video feed over your local network to platforms like Home Assistant that support the Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP). It can also stream to Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThing displays, or Aqara’s seven-inch Panel Hub S1 Plus, of course.

Aqara doesn’t push recurring fees on its doorbell users which is one of the reasons for their popularity. Notably, hardwired G410 installations support continuous 24/7 recording to 512GB (max) microSD cards inserted into the 95dB indoor chime hub that comes with the camera. Video can also sync to NAS storage located on your home network, if you prefer. Aqara does offer a subscription to unlock advanced features, but most people can ignore it, as I do currently with my old G4 doorbell.

The Aqara G410 video doorbell can be purchased now directly from Aqara for $129.99 or through on-line retailers like Amazon.",NewsAPI,-7.27,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-verge-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,38.1,"the verge, Verge, theverge.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-verge/,https://ground.news/interest/the-verge,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/verge-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (1.1),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,,,,,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,theverge.com,,the verge,51,USA,,,,
777,269,"Avoiding trade curbs vital for normalisation of ties, India tells China",https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/china-india-continue-practical-cooperation-051047332.html,2025-07-14T05:10:47Z,Yahoo Entertainment,US,border,"BEIJING/NEW DELHI (Reuters) -India and China must resolve friction along their border, pull back troops and avoid ""restrictive trade measures"" to normalise their relationship, India's foreign minister told his Chinese counterpart in Beijing on Monday.

India's Subrahmanyam Jaishankar met Wang Yi in Beijing during his first trip there since 2020 when a deadly border clash between their troops led to a four-year military standoff and damaged ties until a thaw began in October.

""Good progress"" in the past nine months for normalisation of relations is a result of the resolution of friction along their border, Jaishankar told Wang.

The positive momentum in bilateral relations is ""hard-won and should be cherished"", Wang said, adding that the two countries should enhance political trust, properly handle differences and expand exchanges and cooperation.

""The two sides should trust each other rather than suspect each other, cooperate with each other rather than compete with each other,"" Wang said, according to a readout from his ministry.

India and China share a 3,800 km (2,400 miles) border that is poorly demarcated and has been disputed since the 1950s. They fought a brief but brutal border war in 1962 and talks over the decades to settle the dispute have made slow progress.

Last month, Indian Defence Minister Rajnath Singh told his Chinese counterpart that the two countries should seek a permanent solution to the border dispute.

""It is now incumbent on us to address other aspects related to the border, including de-escalation,"" Jaishankar said, adding that it was also critical that restrictive trade measures and roadblocks be avoided to foster mutually beneficial cooperation.

The minister was speaking against the backdrop of Beijing's restrictions in recent months on supplies of critical minerals such as rare earth magnets and machinery for manufacturing of high-tech goods.

India holds the world's fifth-largest rare earth reserves but its domestic output remains underdeveloped.

""China is willing to strengthen communication and coordination with India to jointly safeguard the multilateral trading system and the stability of global industrial and supply chains,"" Wang told India's top diplomat.

Jaishankar, in China to attend the meeting of foreign ministers of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, met Chinese Vice President Han Zheng earlier in the day, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua reported.

India and China should steadily advance practical cooperation and respect each other's concerns, Han told Jaishankar, Xinhua said.

Getty Images Apartments were among the buildings went up in flames across Ukraine following the Russian air strike

At least three people have died following another widespread air bombardment by Russia. Two people were killed in the eastern Dnipropetrovsk region, the regional head, Serhiy Lysak, said, while a woman died of her injuries after being rescued from a burning apartment in Odesa, according to emergency services. President Volodymyr Zelensky said 10 regions of Ukraine, including a number of cities, were hit in the overnight assault. Ukraine's military said more than 340 explosive and dummy drones and 35 cruise and ballistic missiles were used. Although it said 90% of these were shot down, suppressed electronically or lost, more than 30 got through.

One of the strikes hit a residential block in the southern city of Odesa, causing a fire on its upper floors. Rescuers said five people were rescued from burning apartments - including the woman who later died. At least another six people were wounded. The eastern city of Pavlohrad was subjected to what Serhiy Lysak called a ""hellish night and morning"". He said there had been ""explosion after explosion"" caused by drone and missile strikes, adding it had been the biggest-scale attack on the city to date. Targets reportedly included industrial sites, a fire department, a clinic, a school, and a cultural institution. Zelensky wrote of ""important infrastructure"" being damaged there. A missile plant is based in Pavlohrad, and the city has been struck in the past by Russia. Russia's defence ministry said it struck military-industrial enterprises that produce components for missiles and drones overnight, but did not specify where.

The north-eastern city of Sumy was also attacked. Zelensky said critical infrastructure had been damaged, cutting power to several thousand families. There have also been strikes - including with guided bombs - on another town in the region, Shostka, which lies less than 50km (30 miles) from the Russian border. Officials said a ""targeted hit"" there had caused a fire. They did not say what had been struck. Unverified video footage posted online purportedly of the incident shows a fierce fire and billowing clouds of grey smoke. Zelensky once again stressed the importance of bolstering air defences, both in terms of supplies from allies, but also producing them in Ukraine, including more interceptor drones. The Trump administration recently moved to free up weapons supplies, even if some of these - including much-needed Patriot air defences - will be paid for by other Nato allies.

SEOUL and LONDON -- The South Korean military began dismantling loudspeakers that had been placed along its border with North Korea, South Korea's Defense Ministry said.

The speakers along the Demilitarized Zone were used by the prior administration to broadcast music and news across the border, where the government run by leader Kim Jong Un keeps a tight grip on the media.

The move amounted to a practical measure that was meant to ease tensions between Seoul and Pyongyang, efforts that have been led by the South's President Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June.

The North Korean leadership had called for the speakers to be taken down, saying they were ""psychologically detrimental"" to people near the border, but also appeared ready to reject any overtures from Lee's office.

""We reiterate our official position that we have no interest in any policies established or proposals made in Seoul, and that we have no intention of meeting with South Korea or discussing any issues with it,"" Kim Yo Jong, the leader's sister, said in late July, according to the Korean Central News Agency, a state media outlet.

She added, ""The relationship between the two countries has already completely and irreversibly moved beyond the time frame of the concept of compatriotism.""

The South Korean military said the speakers being taken down wouldn't affect its readiness.

A suspect is dead after opening fire at the entrance of the Border Patrol sector annex in McAllen, Texas, on Monday morning, authorities said.

The suspect, identified as 27-year-old Ryan Louis Mosqueda, fired at the federal building that houses the U.S. Border Patrol offices at the McAllen International Airport, McAllen Police Chief Victor Rodriguez said at a news conference. The suspect never made it inside the building but fired ""many, many rounds at the building,"" Rodriguez said.

A photo of the door of the building showed the damage from bullets striking the glass.

Mosqueda was ""neutralized"" by Border Patrol agents and local police, according to McAllen police and the Department of Homeland Security.

Two officers and a Border Patrol employee were injured, including one officer who was shot in the leg, DHS said. He is expected to be fine, police said.

There is no known motive, Rodriguez said.

782,269,Scientist makes astonishing discovery after observing US-Mexico border wall with motion-sensing cameras: 'Beautiful region',https://www.yahoo.com/news/scientist-makes-astonishing-discovery-observing-104500657.html,2025-07-19T10:45:00Z,Yahoo Entertainment,US,border,"Much has been reported about the border wall between Mexico and the United States. It is designed to separate the two nations and prevent people from passing between the countries unchecked.

However, a study has outlined the large and unintended consequences of the wall on nature and wildlife in the area.

What's happening?

As Vox detailed, the border wall in the southwest United States covering parts of Arizona and New Mexico also cuts through a swath of rugged natural terrain.

The area is home to a diverse ecosystem of plants and animals that have been heavily impacted by the wall.

Ganesh Marín, who was a doctoral researcher at the University of Arizona, set up 85 motion-sensor cameras in the region. The cameras captured various species, including ocelots, jaguars, beavers, and black bears. All in all, Marín ended up with about 21,000 clips.

Why is this study concerning?

The videos suggest the animals are avoiding the wall as much as possible and changing their behaviors in response. This is frustrating because the animals need to be able to wander the area freely to find water, food, and mates.

Unfortunately, this is not the only way the wall has caused a problem for local wildlife. Last year, when fires swept through parts of Texas, frogs, snakes, and other animals close to the border couldn't escape because they were blocked by a section of the border wall.

Ecosystems are already under threat because of rising global temperatures. According to the United Nations, many animals have already lost their habitats due to changing climates as well as the overdevelopment of land. The border wall only exacerbates an already growing problem.

What's being done to protect wildlife?

One way for people to fight back is to take local action in their own communities to ensure wildlife and ecosystems are protected. Another way is to vote for candidates who recognize the importance of these environmental issues, regardless of their side of the political aisle.

As Marín noted, ""Amazing wildlife is present in the borderlands due to the binational efforts to protect and restore the flow of life between both countries. We should not define this beautiful region and the creatures that roam by the existence of an imposed division.""

783,266,Trump Ends Tariff Exemption for Small Packages,https://www.wired.com/story/president-trump-suspends-de-minimis/,2025-07-30T22:17:11Z,Wired,US,border,"US President Donald Trump just dealt another blow to the embattled ecommerce industry, which is still reeling from sweeping tariffs Trump announced in the spring. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order widening the impact of those tariffs and making it more expensive for Americans to buy foreign products on sites like eBay, Etsy, and Amazon.

The order eliminates the so-called “de minimis” provision, a long-standing policy that allowed people in the US to import packages valued at less than $800 from anywhere in the world duty-free. Those packages will now be subject to the same country-specific tariffs as larger shipments, according to a fact sheet released by the White House.

Trump already got rid of the de minimis exemption for Chinese goods earlier this year. The president’s new executive order now removes it for every other country beginning on August 29. Until then, experts say that many foreign sellers and American companies with offshore warehouses will be scrambling to get their goods into the US. “Expect a bunch of sales as brands try to liquidate their overseas inventory in the next 30 days,” Aaron Rubin, CEO of the logistics firm ShipHero, said in a social media post.

There’s some temporary exceptions for packages going through international postal networks, meaning shipments that are not handled by private companies like DHL or FedEx. Because it’s difficult for customs officials to readily calculate the value of these packages, they will be subject to a fixed tariff rate between $80 to $200 per item, at least for now. The Trump administration says this special tariff rule will expire after six months, when all shipments will then be taxed according to the country-specific tariffs that Trump has begun negotiating with individual countries like Japan.

The de minimis exemption was originally designed to allow US travelers to bring home gifts and items purchased abroad for personal use without paying duties. But as the ecommerce industry boomed, the rule also made it cheaper and more efficient for Americans to order goods online from around the world. Until this year, overseas sellers often used the trade loophole to send packages directly to US consumers’ doorsteps at very low cost. According to data from US Customs and Border Protection, the US receives 4 million de minimis shipments every day on average.

Some of the biggest beneficiaries of the policy had been Chinese ecommerce platforms like Shein and Temu, which used de minimis shipments systematically to keep prices low and also build supply chains that could respond to consumer demand in real time. They were the first to fall victim to Trump’s tariffs when he issued an executive order in April removing the exemption for packages coming from China.

When the duty-free exemption ended, some analysts feared it would be an extinction-level threat for the Chinese ecommerce sites, but they have learned to adapt and resumed normal operations for the most part. Temu and Shein did, however, raise prices on many products to account for the added costs of the new tariffs.",NewsAPI,-7.29,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,37.18,"wired, Wired Magazine, wired.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/,https://ground.news/interest/wired,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/wired,LEFT-CENTER (-3.0),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Left,,,-4.07,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,wired.com,,wired,52,USA,,,,

Alejandro Barranco conducts an interview as he arrives to check on his father Narciso, who was detained by federal agents, outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, June 23, 2025, in Los Angeles.

A Marine veteran whose father was detained by federal immigration agents while at his landscaping job in California last month told Congress members on Tuesday that his father is ""traumatized"" by what happened and charged that the immigration system is ""broken.""

Customs and Border Patrol agents arrested Narciso Barranco, who is undocumented, in Santa Ana on June 21, according to the Department of Homeland Security. Video of him being forcibly detained showed masked agents holding him down on the street and repeatedly punching him after he ran from agents.

""My father has no criminal record and should have never been attacked by these agents,"" his son, Alejandro Barranco, told Democratic members of the House Committee on Homeland Security during an oversight forum examining the Trump administration’s detention and deportation practices on Tuesday. ""He supported his family and paid taxes. He is a human being, but he was not treated with the basic dignity he deserved.""

Alejandro Barranco said his father, who has two other sons who are currently serving as Marines, is ""deeply devoted to this country."" The veteran said he believes the current immigration system is ""broken.""

“Cruel and indiscriminate raids are tearing families apart and punishing hard-working people who contribute to our communities every day,"" Alejandro Barranco said. ""My father, like so many others, deserves a fair chance to stay in this country he calls home. The country is better because of people like my dad. It is time our policies reflected that.""

Narciso Barranco has since been released from custody bond but is ""still scared,"" his son said.

""He’s still traumatized from everything that happened,"" Alejandro Barranco said.

The Department of Homeland Security said following the arrest that Narciso Barranco tried to evade law enforcement, ""swung a weed whacker directly at an agent's face"" and resisted commands.

""The agents took appropriate action and followed their training to use the minimum amount of force necessary to resolve the situation in a manner that prioritizes the safety of the public and our officers,"" DHS Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement at the time.

Alejandro Barranco said during Tuesday's forum that his father got scared after the masked agents approached him while he was at work.

""As he worked, he noticed masked men approaching him, and was quickly surrounded by men who did not identify themselves and never presented any type of warrant,"" he said. ""Terrified, he ran. They chased him through the parking lot and into a crowded street. They pointed guns at him, pepper-sprayed him. They tackled him to the ground and kicked him.""

When asked his thoughts about Marines being sent to assist in immigration operations, Alejandro said he believes many would feel ""confused, hurt and just sad about everything that is going on.""

""I served with a lot of Marines who are of Latino backgrounds and whose parents and family members, some of them are undocumented,"" he said.

When asked by Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., if he was still loyal to the U.S., the Marine veteran replied, ""Yes, of course.""

""I decided to join the Marine Corps out of the love I have for this country and to bring honor to my family name,"" Alejandro Barranco said. ""When I told my dad I was going to enlist, he cried with pride. He told me to give everything I had, because we should do anything and everything to give back to our country.""

Russia's ministry of defence released video of what it claimed was a strike by an Iskander ballistic missile in a wooded area that involved more than 20 cluster-type explosions.

The military did not say where the training ground was located, although one Ukrainian war reporter, Andrei Taplienko, said it was in the Chernihiv region north of Kyiv which borders both Russia and Belarus.

Ukrainian ground forces said late on Tuesday that three service personnel were known to have been killed and 18 had been wounded.

The video could not be immediately verified but the Russian MOD claimed that the number of Ukrainian casualties was far higher than Ukraine's military had said. There has been no further word from the military since late on Tuesday.

""Despite the security measures taken, unfortunately it was not possible to completely avoid losses among the personnel,"" Ukraine's ground forces said in a statement on social media.

It is the third Russian attack on a Ukrainian training unit in little more than two months.

An Iskander missile attack on a camp in the norther border region of Sumy killed six servicemen in May and another strike killed 12 people and wounded another 60 last month.

Protecting Ukrainian troops on exercises is particularly sensitive for the military, which said it would investigate whether the ""actions or inaction of officials"" had led to deaths or injuries in Tuesday evening's missile strike.

The commander of ground forces Mykhailo Drapatyi resigned after last month's deadly attack, saying that the victims had been ""young guys from a training battalion"" and that most of them had been in shelters at the time.

In a separate development, Russian forces targeted the regional military administration building in Sumy on Wednesday, wounding a 75-year-old woman, officials said. The same building was hit last Saturday when a drone smashed into the large office block, although nobody was hurt.

Meanwhile, Ukrainian authorities said a sixth person died in hospital from wounds he suffered during a Russian missile strike on a humanitarian aid point in the Kharkiv region on Tuesday.

Ukrainian reports said that four men and two women were fatally wounded while queuing for water.

The man’s skeleton measures over six feet six inches (two meters) in height and dates back to the Middle Bronze Age, approximately 3,800 years ago. Scientists believe he may have been a prominent military leader, due to the way in which he was laid to rest. The discovery offers a glimpse into the social and religious beliefs and rituals of Bronze Age societies, according to a translated statement from the Azerbaijan Ministry of Culture.

The burial mound was found near the Ceyranchol plain, in an area locally known as Yovsanlidere, near Azerbaijan’s western border. Measuring more than 90 feet (28 meters) in diameter and over 6.6 feet (2 meters) in height, the mound contained 14 one-ton limestone slabs face-to-face just beneath its surface, along with a stone idol shaped like a bull and a circular limestone seal.

Known locally as kurgans, burial mounds like this one were ceremonial structures often built by nomadic cultures, offering valuable insights into ancient societies’ rituals and beliefs about the afterlife.

At the center of the mound was a chamber, 6 feet (2 meters) wide and 20 feet (6 meters) long, divided into three sections. One section contained the human skeleton, another was filled with ceramic vessels, and a third was completely empty. The empty space may symbolize the “resting place” for the deceased’s spirit, according to the statement.

The four-pronged bronze spearhead is an especially rare find, not just in Azerbaijan but throughout the broader South Caucasus region. Alongside the spear, researchers uncovered a variety of other valuable items, including bronze ankle adornments, obsidian tools, paste beads, and inlaid ceramic pottery, suggesting the individual held significant prestige. Inside the ceramic vessels, they found the bones of cooked animals, believed to be provisions for the afterlife.

For the past five years, more than 2,000 academics and volunteers, both local and international, have conducted research on the Keshikchidagh reserve, an archaeological hotspot. Research on the Keshikchidagh site is ongoing, and plans for laboratory analyses—including carbon dating and isotope testing—are underway for the newly discovered burial mound, the researchers said in the statement.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,

As lawmakers negotiate next year's defense bill, some are sounding alarms over the possibility that funds intended to improve housing for junior troops could instead be diverted to support military operations at home.

In a hearing on Tuesday, Rep. Sara Jacobs, a California Democrat, pushed to add two stipulations into the House version of the National Defense Authorization Act aimed at safeguarding funding for military barracks and childcare centers. The proposals would have prohibited using the funds for domestic deployments of troops — specifically in support of immigration enforcement — and barred their transfer to border operations.

""This is simply saying that the money that we allocate as Congress for barracks and child development centers and quality of life infrastructure should be used for barracks and child development centers and quality of life infrastructure, not anything else,"" she said during the hearing.

Both additions were shot down along party lines.

Military barracks, dormitories where unmarried junior troops are housed, have long been plagued by maintenance issues. Many buildings are decades-old and have fallen into disrepair during 20 years of war in the Middle East.

""This is about actually showing our service members that we care about them,"" Rep. Jill Tokuda, a Democrat from Hawaii, said during the hearing, highlighting instances of barracks rooms overrun by black mold, leaky plumbing, unreliable electrical and A/C systems, and a lack of kitchens.

A 2022 government watchdog report noted how continuously delayed maintenance aggravates problems for the military's buildings around the world, valued at $1.3 trillion overall. In fiscal year 2020, for instance, the DoD's deferred maintenance backlog amounted to over $137 billion, exacerbated by ""competing priorities"".

A separate report the following year found widespread concerns about barracks management oversight and hazardous health risks to troops— and noted that shoddy conditions harm troop morale.

The services have taken note after coming under fire for the poor living conditions highlighted in the reports and scandalous news reports of substandard living conditions.

The Army sought $2.35 billion last year to address barracks concerns, an over 60% increase in funding from the year prior. The Marine Corps, meanwhile, has undertaken a decade-long, nearly $11 billion refurbishment program.

""The idea is not to fix it and forget it,"" Lt. Gen. James Adams, Deputy Commandant for Programs and Resources, said of the initiative during a panel at the Modern Day Marine expo in April, explaining that the Corps partly ""got ourselves into the position we're in now"" by neglecting maintenance.

But the military is facing maintenance woes on other fronts too— one of the Army's biggest bases was forced to dissolve its teams that oversaw preventative housing maintenance last month, amid federal government cuts, according to Military.com. And the Pentagon sought to shift $1 billion intended for Army barracks to finance deployments to the southern border earlier this year.

In a statement provided to Business Insider, Jacobs said that funds approved for barracks issues and childcare centers — which have faced staffing shortages and meager pay — are already a comparatively modest sum, considering the level of disrepair with which some facilities must contend.

""There's not enough money as it is to upgrade and maintain quality of life infrastructure like barracks and child development centers, and address urgent issues like mold and broken heating and A/C units,"" Jacobs wrote. ""None of this money should be diverted for any reason — let alone to terrorize immigrant communities and stifle dissent.""

""The fact that a billion dollars in the first six months of this administration was diverted from barracks and quality of life and operations and maintenance to the border is sending the message that we really don't care about your health and wellness,"" Tokuda said during the hearing, adding that money transfers were equivalent to ""essentially guaranteeing that we will ultimately never fix these barracks.""",NewsAPI,-4.05,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,40.61,"business insider, Business Insider, Insider, businessinsider.com, insider.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/business-insider/,https://ground.news/interest/business-insider,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/insider-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.3),MOSTLY FACTUAL (2.3),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Axel Springer SE,2007,-1.46,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,businessinsider.com,,business insider,20,USA,,,,
788,2,US government seeks tool to find 'hidden language' in phone messages,https://9to5mac.com/2025/07/07/us-government-seeks-tool-to-find-hidden-language-in-messages-on-your-phone/,2025-07-07T12:31:51Z,9to5Mac,US,border,"The United States Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is seeking pitches from tech companies for a forensic tool intended to find “hidden language” in messages on smartphones searched at the border …

The CPB says that it expects companies to propose modified versions of software they already have working, as there isn’t time to devise something from scratch.

Wired spotted the request on a government procurement website.

The agency said in a federal registry listing that the tools it’s seeking must have very specific capabilities, such as the ability to find a “hidden language” in a person’s text messages.

The requirement appears to be for an AI-powered tool.

Able to ingest multiple file types to include standard audio, video, image, text and other file types. Able to identify patterns, connections, and leads in support of investigation and other law enforcement action, specifically border enforcement, activities […] Help expedite the analysis of data extracted and improve decision making on the ground to further enforcement actions. Example: search a list of text messages to find patterns or “hidden language” in suspect communications that may not be obvious at first look.

The CPB also wants the tool to be able to compare data with that extracted from other devices, or obtained by other means.

Perform data analytics on forensically acquired electronic data including text, images and video. Example: a “red tricycle” appears in different videos acquired from different data sets.

The deadline for submissions is July 10, and says this is an early-stage enquiry for information only, with formal invitations to bid to follow at a later stage.

What happened?

Johana Mar attempted to enter the United States through the Brownsville Gateway crossing when officers discovered the baby primates concealed inside a bag. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service took her into custody on June 9.

After being detained, Mar acknowledged bringing the protected animals across the border without authorization.

""Mar stated that she did not know if she was allowed to bring monkeys into the U.S. and that is why she did not declare them to (CBP). Mar stated that she received the monkeys from a friend who she only communicates (with) through Facebook and Whatsapp,"" according to the criminal complaint.

Mar had no documentation or licensing for transporting endangered species across international boundaries.

Why is wildlife trafficking concerning?

Spider monkeys face extinction, making their illegal trade an attack on conservation efforts. Every smuggled animal is a loss to wild populations already struggling with habitat destruction.

These primates are nature's gardeners, spreading seeds that grow into the trees and plants other wildlife depend on for survival. When their numbers drop, entire ecosystems suffer.

Illegal animal trafficking also creates pathways for disease transmission that can jump from wildlife to humans or domestic animals. Smuggled creatures often carry pathogens that pose health risks to border communities.

The underground market for exotic pets drives poachers to capture more animals from their natural homes, accelerating the decline of endangered species.

What's being done about wildlife trafficking?

Border protection agencies train officers to spot hidden animals during routine vehicle inspections. These partnerships between customs officials and wildlife experts help intercept more smuggling attempts before protected species enter illegal markets.

You can help protect endangered primates by supporting wildlife conservation organizations that focus on habitat preservation and anti-poaching efforts.

A Cambodian BM-21 multiple rocket launcher returns from the Cambodia-Thai border as Cambodian and Thai troops exchanged fire in a new round of clashes in Preah Vihear province on July 24, 2025.

LONDON -- Thailand and Cambodia were engaged in armed clashes, including rocket and artillery fire, along a disputed area of their border, the U.S. State Department said in an alert.

Both countries accused the other of firing the first shots as tensions boiled over on Thursday and reports of casualties begin to emerge.

The fighting came after Thailand recalled its ambassador to Cambodia on Wednesday and said it would expel Cambodia's envoy in Bangkok, according to Reuters.

""U.S. citizens living or traveling near the Thailand-Cambodia border should follow direction from Thai security services and consult local government authorities for the latest information,"" the U.S. Embassy and Consulate in Thailand said in a security alert.

The initial shots took place near the Ta Moan Thom temple -- around 225 miles from Bangkok -- and were followed by what Thailand described as airstrikes on military targets in Cambodia, after nine Thai civilians were killed by shelling from Cambodia targeting civilian areas, including a hospital, according to officials in Bangkok.

Thailand’s military says it has closed all border checkpoints with Cambodia and that fighting was taking place at six different points, prompting Bangkok to activate an emergency war readiness plan.

Thailand and Cambodia have contested sovereignty for more than a century at various contested points along their 508 miles of land border. This has led to several skirmishes over the years that has killed at least a dozen, including a weeklong exchange of artillery in 2011.

Starting in January 2026, the Swedish furniture giant will release more than 20 new Matter-over-Thread smart lights, sensors, and remotes. The products will work directly with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Samsung SmartThings through native Matter compatibility. Pricing will remain comparable to current products, which start under $10.

To recap, Thread is a low-power wireless mesh protocol that runs on the 2.4GHz band and is designed for devices such as sensors, bulbs, plugs, and shades. It's IP-based, so devices can talk directly to each other over the internet, and on other networks via a Thread Border Router (such as a HomePod mini or Apple TV 4K).

Meanwhile, Matter is an open-sourced, IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home devices that was co-developed by Apple, Amazon, Google, and others. It works over Wi-Fi, Ethernet, and Thread.

IKEA also recently rolled out a beta update for its Dirigera smart home hub that activates its built-in Thread radio and adds support for Matter. With this update, Dirigera now works as both a Matter Controller and a Thread Border Router, so it can connect to and control any compatible Matter device – including those from other brands – as well as IKEA's upcoming Matter-based product line, which is set to replace its current Zigbee offerings.

""We want to remove barriers to complexity, we want it to be simple to use, and we just want it to work,"" David Granath of IKEA of Sweden told The Verge. ""If you're an Apple user, take our bulb and onboard it to your Apple Home.""

The news should be a welcome development for HomeKit users, who previously faced limited affordable options. IKEA's existing smart home products required workarounds or lengthy waits for HomeKit support.

A recent investigation by The Guardian and the Brazilian newspaper O Globo reveals that missionaries have left solar-powered audio devices in Brazil’s Javari valley, near the Peruvian border, in an attempt to evangelize isolated or recently contacted Indigenous Amazonian people. The devices play biblical readings in Portuguese and Spanish.

For example, a device identified by The Guardian announces, “Let’s see what Paul says as he considers his own life in Philippians chapter 3, verse 4: ‘If someone else thinks they have reasons to put confidence in the flesh, I have more.’”

The Javari Valley Indigenous Territory has the highest concentration of uncontacted human groups in the world. To protect the indigenous tribes, Brazil’s National Foundation for the Indian (FUNAI) made it illegal to enter Javari Valley in 1987. Nevertheless, locals have reported up to seven audio devices, though the investigation secured photo and video evidence of just one—a yellow and gray phone-sized gadget that materialized in a Korubo village and plays audios spoken by an American Baptist.

The Korubo are members of a recently contacted group of indigenous people known for their war clubs. According to the investigation, the device is now in the hands of a Korubo woman named Mayá.

The device is reportedly called “Messenger,” and the Baptist organization In Touch Ministries donates them to “unreached” people around the world, as reported by the investigation. In fact, their website clearly features what seems to be a version of the device, along with a whole host of similar gadgets.

“What began with a solar-powered audio player containing the Bible and Dr. Stanley’s messages is now much more than a device,” reads the website. “Wherever we go, we look for the right solution at the right time—whether it’s one of our proprietary devices or another tool—to make sure the message of salvation in Jesus Christ is accessible to those who have never heard.”

In Touch Ministries’ chief operating officer Seth Grey, however, told The Guardian that while he knew of missionaries from other organizations who bring Messengers to regions where it is illegal to do so, “we [In Touch staff] don’t go anywhere we’re not allowed.”

In case anyone forgot since the last time we reported on Westerners trying to contact isolated tribal people, such contact could transmit devastating diseases to communities with little to no immunity to them. Of course, this risk is higher in the case of direct physical contact, as opposed to leaving gadgets outdoors, but it’s still in violation of Brazil’s public policy for the protection of isolated indigenous peoples of not establishing contact.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,

DSNS Odesa The famous Pryvoz market in Odesa, Ukraine was damaged by an overnight strike

Drone strikes by both Moscow and Kyiv killed two in Russia and three in Ukraine, hours after a brief third round of ceasefire talks concluded in Istanbul. Three people were found dead in the rubble of a house after a strike in Ukraine's eastern Kharkiv region and several people were wounded in the cities of Cherkasy and Zaporizhzhia. In the Black Sea port city of Odesa the famous Pryvoz market, as well as a central boulevard which is a Unesco world heritage site, were also hit. Several fires broke out across the city following an overnight attack, authorities said.

Meanwhile, Russian authorities said two people were killed and 11 injured in an overnight Ukrainian drone strike on Sochi, in Russia's Krasnodar region. Another Russian attack on the Ukrainian city Kharkiv on Thursday morning also left 33 injured. Ukrainian and Russian delegations met on Wednesday evening in Istanbul in the third round of ceasefire talks. Neither side appeared to harbour much hope for progress before start of the talks, which according to the head of the Ukrainian delegation lasted barely an hour. The head of the Russian delegation, Vladimir Medinsky, said both countries agreed to swap 1,200 prisoners of war and that Russia had offered to transfer 3,000 bodies of fallen Ukrainian soldiers back to Kyiv. But no tangible steps were taken to end the conflict, now well into its fourth year, and both sides accused the other of rejecting their ideas. ""We did not expect a breakthrough. A breakthrough is hardly possible,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov on Thursday. Ahead of the meeting the head of the Ukrainian delegation, Rustem Umerov, said the ""priority"" for Kyiv was to organise a meeting between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky before the end of August.

Rumors claim Motorola is preparing a ""crystal-studded"" special edition model of its Razr 2025 foldable with Swarovski.

The alleged rendering shows the device with crystals popped into the foldable's form factor near its cover display and its rear panel.

A tipster claims Motorola is preparing to unveil this phone in August 5.

Motorola recently dropped a huge collaboration with Paris Hilton for a Paris Pink Razr Plus 2024.

Did anyone order a fancy Motorola foldable collaboration? Rumors suggest we might see one pretty soon.

A render of a fancy-looking Motorola Razr was posted by YTECHB today (July 11), suggesting an incoming collaboration edition (via GSMArena). The publication claims Motorola is preparing to bring a fancy new ""crystal-studded"" Razr 2025 foldable edition. From the rendering, the device looks mostly the same, save for the small crystals (kind of like diamonds) popped into its form factor.

On the cover display, there are supposedly three crystals implanted near the hinge, just above the screen. The back of the device is where the design is reportedly going to shine the most. It seems Motorola will implant crystal studs into a (seemingly) soft fabric material, which looks almost like a fancified purse.

Prominent X tipster Evan Blass got in on things, stating this phone is looking at a debut on August 5; however, we might know who it's with. The tipster's post and the publication both claim Motorola is looking at Swarovski, a jewelry company, to bedazzle its foldable.

Moreover, it seems this collaboration edition will only concern the base Razr 2025 foldable. The rendering doubles down on this, furthered by the thicker border between the cover display and the hinge. The Razr Ultra offers a slightly larger display (4-inch), so the border is much thinner on it.

The name Swarovski might sound familiar, and that's because Motorola collaborated with them once before (or you like their jewelry). Earlier this year, when the Razr 2025 series debuted, Motorola launched its first-ever open-earbuds, the Buds Loop. These buds are offered with 12mm drivers for rich sound, and they come in the following colors: Pantone-curated Trekking Green and a dazzling Pantone-curated French Oak.

However, there was a third option: a crystal-encrusted version, thanks to Swarovski. These buds are lighter in color, and the crystals are present along the band that connects the two halves of the device for each ear. It seems Motorola was pleased with the first round, so it's looking into the collaboration again for its foldable phone.

Israel continues to insist that it places no restrictions on aid trucks entering Gaza, an assertion that is not accepted by close allies or the United Nations and other agencies active in Gaza.

""We call on the Israeli government to immediately lift restrictions on the flow of aid and urgently allow the UN and humanitarian NGOs to carry out their work in order to take action against starvation. Israel must uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law.""

Israel has offered to allow air drops of aid into Gaza. It's a gesture towards allies who are issuing strong statements blaming Israel for starvation in Gaza.

In other wars I have seen aid being dropped, both from the aircraft themselves and close up on the ground as it lands.

It is a crude process, that will not on its own do much to end hunger in Gaza. Only a ceasefire and an unrestricted, long term aid operation can do that.

In Iraqi Kurdistan after the 1991 Gulf War the US, UK and others dropped aid from C-130 transport aircraft, mostly army rations, sleeping bags and surplus winter uniforms to tens of thousands living in the open on the sides of mountains. I flew with them and watched British and American airmen dropping aid from the rear cargo ramps of the planes thousands of feet above the people who needed it.

It was welcome enough. But a few days later when I managed to reach the camps in the mountains, I saw young men running into minefields to get aid that landed there. Some were killed and maimed in explosions. I saw families killed when heavy pallets dropped on their tents.

When Mostar was besieged during the war in Bosnia in 1993 I saw pallets of American military ""meals ready to eat"", dropped from high altitude, scattered all over the east side of the city that was being constantly shelled. Some aid pallets crashed through roofs that had somehow not been destroyed by artillery attacks.

Air dropping aid is an act of desperation. It can also look good on television, and spread a feel-good factor that something, at last, is being done.

Professionals involved in relief operations regard air dropping aid as a last resort. They use it when any other access is impossible. That's not the case in Gaza. A short drive north is Ashdod, Israel's modern container port. A few more hours away is the Jordanian border, which has been used regularly as a supply line for aid for Gaza.

Dropping aid delivers very little. Even big transport planes do not carry as much as a convoy of lorries.

Pallets dropped by parachute often land far from the people who need it. Israel has forced hundreds of thousands of starving Palestinian civilians into a tiny area on the southern coast of Gaza. Most of them live in densely packed tents. It is not clear if there is even an open space for despatchers high in the sky to aim at.

Each pallet will now be fought over by desperate men trying to get food for their families, and by criminal elements who will want to sell it for profit.",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,

Israel has responded to sustained and growing international condemnation that it is responsible for starvation in Gaza by announcing a series of measures the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) said would ""improve the humanitarian response"". It is allowing airdrops of aid, carrying out the first one itself during the night and allowing the United Arab Emirates air force to follow with another later on Sunday. The IDF also announced that it would allow a ""tactical pause in military activity"" in some areas and set up ""designated humanitarian corridors… to refute the false claim on intentional starvation."" Hamas has condemned the moves as a ""deception"". Israel, it said, was ""whitewashing its image before the world"". Follow live updates

Israel later carried out an airstrike during the ""tactical pause."" Reports from the scene say a mother called Wafaa Harara and her four children, Sara, Areej, Judy and Iyad were killed. While Israel continues to insist it is not responsible for the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza and does not impose restrictions on aid entering Gaza, those claims are not accepted by its close allies in Europe, or the United Nations and other agencies active in Gaza. The new measures might be a tacit admission by the Israelis that they need to do more. More likely they are a gesture to allies who have issued strong statements blaming Israel for starvation in Gaza. The latest, on Friday 25 July, from Britain, France and Germany was stark. ""We call on the Israeli government to immediately lift restrictions on the flow of aid and urgently allow the UN and humanitarian NGOs to carry out their work in order to take action against starvation. Israel must uphold its obligations under international humanitarian law."" Israel followed a total blockade of all aid into Gaza with restrictions on the approval of the contents and movement of aid convoys. With the Americans, it has set up a new system of distributing aid through the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), intended to replace the aid network run by the United Nations. Israel claims that Hamas stole aid from the UN system. The UN says it is still waiting for the Israelis to back their claims with evidence. The UN and other agencies will not cooperate with the GHF system, which they say is inhumane and militarised. More than 1,000 Palestinians have been shot dead looking for food since the GHF operation, according to the UN. A retired US special forces colonel who worked for the GHF in Gaza told the BBC that he saw American colleagues and IDF soldiers opening fire on civilians. Both deny they have targeted civilians.

Watch: Air drop aid seen arriving in northern Gaza

Jonathan Whittall, the head in the Occupied Palestinian Territories of the UN's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (OCHA) has already condemned the methods used by the GHF. Israel told him his visa would not be renewed after he posted on social media a month ago that the GHF system had brought to Gaza ""conditions created to kill… what we are seeing is carnage. It is weaponised hunger. It is forced displacement. It's a death sentence for people just trying to survive. It appears to be the erasure of Palestinian life"". After Israel announced its new measures, Whittall told the BBC that ""the humanitarian situation in Gaza has never been worse"". He said for Israel's new measures to change matters for the better it would have to reduce the time it takes to allow trucks to transit the crossings into Gaza and improve the routes provided by the IDF for the convoys to use. Israel would also need to provide ""meaningful assurances that the people gathering to take food off the back of the trucks won't be shot by Israeli forces"". Whittall has been going in and out of Gaza since the war started, though that is now ending unless Israel decides not to withdraw his visa after all. He says that as IDF military operations continue ""there remains an abhorrent disregard for humanitarian law"". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defence minister Yoav Gallant are already the subject of an arrest warrant issued by the International Criminal Court last year, accused of joint criminal responsibility for ""the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare; and the crimes against humanity of murder, persecution, and other inhumane acts."" Netanyahu, Gallant and the Israeli state deny the allegations. Israel released grainy footage of a transport plane dropping pallets of aid into Gaza. Lines of parachutes billowed out the back of the aircraft in the dark of the night. The IDF said it had delivered seven packages of aid containing flour, sugar and tinned food. In other wars I have seen aid being dropped, both from the aircraft themselves and close up on the ground as it lands. Air dropping aid is an act of desperation. It can also look good on television, and spread a feel-good factor that something, at last, is being done. It is a crude process, that will not on its own do much to end hunger in Gaza. Only a ceasefire and an unrestricted, long term aid operation can do that. Even big transport planes do not carry as much as a small convoy of lorries.

Welcome back to our Sunday edition, where we spotlight some of our top stories and bring you behind the scenes of our newsroom. This week, we put a big question to BI readers: Can millennial dads really have it all?

Many fathers told us they're feeling burned out trying to excel at work and be fully present at home. I get it. As a dad of two young kids, I do my best to be an active, present, and equal parenting partner. But I also see, every day, just how much of the heavy lifting my wife does.

What's your take on the millennial dad paradox? Is true balance possible—or just a myth we're still chasing? We'd love to hear from you.

Inside an exclusive entrepreneurs' club

Kathleen Elkins is the kind of journalist who preaches what she covers. She's been writing for years about real estate investing, e-commerce entrepreneurs, and side hustles. She has taken this coverage and put it to practical use: Last year, she started her own business selling pickleball paddles online.

Kathleen recently profiled an exclusive group of Amazon sellers making seven figures in annual revenue. (No, she's not a member — maybe one day!) I sat down with Kathleen to learn more about these entrepreneurs and how they achieved their success.

How did you find out about this niche community of thriving Amazon sellers?

A previous source who I keep in touch with is super ingrained in the Amazon seller community and suggested I talk to one of the cofounders of Million Dollar Sellers. She put us in touch, we set up an intro call, and I pretty immediately knew that I wanted to proceed with a story about the community and how one gets into the exclusive club.

What is it like to be a member of this club? How does one get into it, and what are the benefits?

The cofounder I spoke to, Eugene Khayman, told me the two biggest perks of being a member are the Facebook Group and the events. He likened them to ""a family reunion, where you're actually excited to see everybody there."" He knows how difficult and lonely it can feel at times to sell to faceless customers, and the in-person events help him get fired up and gain positive momentum.

What did you learn from these e-commerce sellers that might help you in your own side hustle?

After writing about e-commerce entrepreneurs for years, I decided to give it a go myself, mostly out of curiosity: Can anyone — including a journalist with some savings and a couple of free hours after work — make money selling things online? What does it really take? Turns out, a lot of time and effort. Starting a business, even as a side project, is all-consuming.

I'll leave you with two takeaways: One, I'm going to have to spend money on Amazon ads. Two, keep talking to people in the e-commerce space who know what they're doing and get curious. As Eugene told me, ""It's all about putting yourself in a room with people that are smarter than you.""

Fear and denial in DC

Momo Takahashi for BI

For months, mass DOGE layoffs were stalled as a legal battle between the White House and advocacy groups played out. That all changed Tuesday, when the Supreme Court announced it wouldn't stand in the way of the Trump administration.

BI spoke to 16 employees at federal agencies to gauge the reaction. Most used words like ""fear,"" ""uncertainty,"" ""disheartening,"" and ""bleak"" to describe the mood within their agencies. Some expressed concern about their livelihoods and financial security, as well as the future of public service.

""I can't see any of this ending well.""

toggle caption Ashlee Rezin/AP/Chicago Sun-Times

Hazy skies hung over parts of the midwest and northeastern U.S. on Sunday, caused by smoke drifting across the border from hundreds of wildfires in Canada.

Canada is experiencing its second worst wildfire season on record, according to government data, with almost 4,000 fires recorded already this calendar year.

Smoke coming across the border has affected air quality in several U.S. states. This weekend, air quality reached concerning levels across Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota. Parts of Illinois and Indiana are also under air quality alerts. People in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine are also being advised to limit outdoor activity due to pollution from the smoke.

National Weather Service Lead Forecaster Bob Oravec told NPR that the current wind patterns are once again driving the spread of polluted air into the U.S. from Canada.

""Air is moving at all levels and a lot of times it'll move in the same direction through the whole depth of the atmosphere, so the smoke is rising into the winds and the winds just transport it downstream, like anything — like a leaf getting blown,"" Oravec explained.

On Friday, Minnesota's Pollution Control Agency extended its statewide air quality alert until noon on Monday, August 4th.

Minnesota Public Radio reports the state is currently under its longest air quality alert since the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency began issuing alerts in 2008. The alert is expected to last seven days in total.

Conditions started improving in some areas of Minnesota on Sunday. Earlier this weekend, the agency reported it expected the air quality index (AQI) to reach the most severe level of ""red"" for all of the state, which is considered unhealthy for everyone.

In a statement, the Pollution Control Agency warned that even healthy people may experience symptoms such as irritated eyes, coughing, or shortness of breath. Others could feel more serious impacts, the agency said.

""Sensitive or more exposed individuals may experience more serious health effects, including worsening of existing heart or lung disease and respiratory and cardiovascular conditions, possibly leading to an asthma attack, heart attack, or stroke,"" according to the Pollution Control Agency statement.

Elsewhere, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources extended its air quality alert for several counties until noon on Monday, August 4th, mostly in the southeast part of the state. Health officials in Michigan also extended the state's alert in all counties through Monday.

Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre reported that more than 700 active fires were burning across Canada on Sunday, mostly in the southern province of Manitoba, directly to the north of Minnesota. The agency says more than 500 are burning out of control. Thousands of Canadians have had to evacuate their homes to escape the fires.

Wildfires have been raging in parts of Canada for much of the year. In May, two people who were trapped by a wildfire in southeastern Manitoba were killed. In June, parts of the U.S. experienced similar conditions from the smoke.

Oravec says poor air quality could impact areas of the U.S. for some time.

""It looks like that pattern maintains itself going forward through this week, so it doesn't really appear to be any big break. There may be a day or so where there's a temporary break to it, but overall it looks like there is potential for additional smoke to be transported southeastward into the United States,"" he said.",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,
803,269,Texas man indicted for fatally shooting Afghan refugee who had helped US troops defuse bombs,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/texas-man-indicted-fatally-shooting-224645544.html,2025-07-31T22:46:45Z,Yahoo Entertainment,US,refugee,"HOUSTON (AP) — The brother of an Afghan refugee who helped U.S. forces defuse bombs during the war in Afghanistan expressed frustration Thursday that it took more than three months for the Texas man accused of fatally shooting his sibling over a parking dispute to be indicted in the case.

When Abdul Rahman Waziri, 31, was shot while getting his mail at his Houston apartment complex on April 27, police knew who the alleged shooter was as the man had identified himself to officers at the scene, according to authorities. Katia Trevon Bougere, 31, told officers “he and Waziri were arguing over parking,” police said.

“After consulting with the Harris County District Attorney’s Office, the male was released and the investigation continued,” Houston police said in a statement a day after the shooting.

On June 17, police said the case would be referred to a grand jury. Bougere was indicted on Monday on a murder charge. Bougere was not arrested after his murder indictment but issued a summons to appear in court on Aug. 5.

Abdullah Khan, Waziri’s older brother, said he and his family were upset that months had passed without any developments in the case.

“It was heartbreaking … it was really hopeless. I couldn’t imagine if someone is killing someone senselessly. And then the person walking free for months and months. It’s just terrible,” Khan, 36, told The Associated Press during a phone interview.

Waziri and his brother had worked for the Afghan National Mine Reduction Group, a highly trained unit that cleared improvised explosive devices and mines for U.S. Army Special Forces and Afghan commandos.

A group of Green Berets who had worked with the National Mine Reduction Group had sent a letter in May to Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare asking for action in the case. A Change.org petition by the 1208 Foundation that asked for the alleged shooter to be charged has received more than 86,000 signatures. The foundation provides aid to Afghans who worked with U.S. Special Forces to clear explosives.

The Harris County District Attorney’s Office declined to comment on the case.

“As the case is pending, it’s not our office’s policy to discuss facts related to the investigation,” spokesperson Courtney Fischer said in an email.

Court records did not list an attorney for Bougere. He did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment.

Omar Khawaja, an attorney for Waziri's family, said Bougere has claimed that he shot Waziri in self-defense.

Waziri “was known as a gentle giant ... not someone who is going to lose his cool over a dispute in a parking lot,” Khawaja said.

Khan said his brother had parked his car in front of the mailboxes at his apartment complex and was getting his mail when he was confronted by Bougere.

A witness who saw the physical confrontation between Waziri and Bougere indicated Waziri was not the aggressor and had raised his hands and told Bougere, “Don’t shoot,” Khan said.

Khan had worked with the National Mine Reduction Group from 2008 until coming to the U.S. in 2020. Waziri worked for the unit from 2016 until U.S. troops withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021.

Khan settled in Tampa, Florida. Waziri lived with his brother before coming to Houston about two years ago. Khan said his brother had planned to return to Tampa with his wife and two daughters after his apartment lease in Houston had ended.

“When he came and we were feeling safe, we were like, ’Oh, thank God. We got out of Afghanistan and no more gunfire, no more bombs.' But unfortunately for my brother, it happened to him,” Khan said.

804,8,Infantino says ‘important step’ taken for Afghan women’s football,https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2025/8/1/infantino-says-important-step-taken-for-afghan-womens-football,2025-08-01T12:48:12Z,Al Jazeera English,US,refugee,"A group of Afghan refugee players participated in the first of three global talent identification camps in Sydney last month as part of efforts to build a 23-player women’s squad for friendly internationals this year, world football body FIFA has revealed.

Many players from the women’s national team fled the country over fears of persecution after the Taliban took control of the government in 2021, and they have been fighting for their right to play internationally again after being excluded from World Cup qualifying events.

The Taliban-controlled Afghan Football Federation has banned women’s sports, shattering the dreams of the team, which requires recognition by a national federation to compete internationally.

The Taliban says it respects women’s rights in accordance with its interpretation of Islamic law and local customs, and that internal matters should be addressed locally.

There was a ray of hope in May, however, after FIFA approved the creation of an Afghan women’s refugee team and named Pauline Hamill as coach, with the former Scotland international holding the team’s first talent camp from July 23 to 29 in Sydney.

“It’s great to have the players here,” 53-year-old Hamill told the FIFA website on Friday.

“Now we have the chance to work with them and try to evaluate their performance, and they can all come together again in an environment that they always wanted to be a part of.

“I think it’s an incredible project. It’s given the players the chance to perform and play together again. I think they’ll create memories that they otherwise wouldn’t have created, and making memories with your team is really special.”

FIFA is hopeful that players from the trials can take part in approved friendlies later this year, thereby returning Afghan women’s football to the international stage.

It said it would also provide equipment and help them build connections with local clubs and enable access to counselling, media and social media training, as well as identify potential educational pathways and opportunities within the sport.

“I am confident that we have taken an important step in the right direction by offering these women the opportunity to play internationally while prioritising their safety and wellbeing…,” FIFA President Gianni Infantino said.

“We are proud of this, of having brought to life this pilot project, and our aim is to expand it in the future to include women from other countries as well.”

Nilab, one of the players at July’s camp, said football has helped her a lot.

“My goal is not just about me,” Nilab said. “It’s about all Afghanistan, especially women and girls. This project helps and supports me, and teaches us how we can help each other and how to represent Afghanistan.”",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

More than 11 million refugees risk losing access to humanitarian aid owing to a “dramatic” funding crisis, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

The extent of UNHCR’s funding shortfall was revealed in a report released on Friday, which said it had so far received only 23 percent of this year’s goal of $10.6bn, projecting an overall budget of only $3.5bn by the end of the year to meet the needs of 122 million people.

“Our funding situation is dramatic,” Dominique Hyde, director of external relations for UNHCR, said.

“We fear that up to 11.6 million refugees and people forced to flee are losing access to humanitarian assistance provided by UNHCR.”

While countries that have slashed contributions were not named in the report, the crisis has been compounded by a major reduction in funding from the United States, which provided 40 percent – more than $2bn – of the agency’s total donations last year.

Since taking office in January, President Donald Trump’s administration has made funding cuts to the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and its aid programmes worldwide in what it says is part of its broader plan to remove wasteful spending.

UNHCR said it has had to stop or suspend about $1.4bn worth of aid programmes, including a 60 percent reduction in financial aid and emergency relief supplies in many countries, including Sudan, Myanmar and Afghanistan.

Critical areas such as medical aid, education, shelter, nutrition, and protection are among the services suffering deep cuts, said the report, entitled “On the Brink: The devastating toll of aid cuts on people forced to flee”.

In Bangladesh, where Rohingya refugees have lived for years in overcrowded camps, education for some 230,000 children is at risk of being suspended.

Women and girls are disproportionately affected by UNHCR funding cuts, with the agency having to cut one quarter of its support for programmes on gender-based violence.

Women and girls in Afghanistan are the hardest hit by cuts, according to the report.

“Protection activities have been slashed by over 50 percent, undermining programmes on women’s empowerment, mental health and prevention and response to gender-based violence,” said Hyde.

Globally, UNHCR is downsizing by a third, cutting 3,500 staff positions at its Geneva headquarters and in regional offices.

The report comes after the UN’s 2025 Global AIDS Update warned last week that Trump’s halt to foreign funding could reverse “decades of progress” on HIV/AIDS. If funding is not replaced, the world could see six million extra HIV infections and four million more AIDS-related deaths by 2029, it said.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

We’ve repeatedly argued that one of the reason immigration has gotten a bad name, particularly officially-sponsored refugee initiatives such as Germany and other EU members accepting large numbers of Syrians in 2015 and 2016, is the lack of planning (including basics like temporary housing) and little to no thought about how to get them employed and otherwise integrated into their new home countries. Keep in mind that nations like Germany accept the proposition that they need migrants to compensate for below-level birthrates. And Syrians in particular were seen as a potentially desirable group due to the high caliber of public education in Syria.

This article looks at some of the nuts and bolts of facilitating refugee integration. Contrary to the common practice of giving new entrants language and job training before trying to place them in jobs, it seems the better way is to get the refugees into work settings and provide instruction in parallel. This makes sense; if you’ve ever tried learning a language, a lot of daily exposure (even if you can’t yet grasp much of what is said), speeds becoming competent. A second advantage of putting refugees with an employer is that they will acquire industry-specific vocabulary early. And making personal connections is a big plus in getting settled in a strange country.

An important factoid is in the headline: this approach is not expensive.

Rodolfo Debenedetti Foundation. Originally published at VoxEU

The number of people fleeing war and persecution worldwide has nearly tripled since the early 2010s, challenging European policymakers to ensure swift integration of asylum seekers into the labour market. This column assesses a pilot programme in Italy that provides early, personalised labour market support to asylum seekers. Even in resource-constrained settings, the early targeted support led to a 30% net increase in employment, improved the quality of employment, boosted language proficiency, and fostered greater social integration with the local communities.

As European policymakers revisit migration policy amidst rising political pressure and renewed arrivals across the Mediterranean, one of the most pressing questions is how to ensure that asylum seekers can integrate swiftly into the labour market. The challenge is not new, but it has become urgent. Since the early 2010s, the number of people fleeing war and persecution worldwide nearly tripled, from 11 million to 36 million. Across Europe, asylum systems are widely seen as too slow, disconnected from economic realities, and poorly equipped to support newcomers’ transition into employment. Finding ways to improve integration for asylum seekers in their new countries can reduce the global tensions around this vulnerable population.

A growing consensus points to early labour market access as a key ingredient for successful integration (e.g. Fasani et al. 2018). Rather than placing asylum seekers in prolonged language or vocational courses before they are allowed to work, fast-tracking them into jobs with targeted support can prevent long periods of inactivity that often erode skills and motivation (Schuettler and Caron 2020). Delays caused by asylum procedures and bureaucratic hurdles to obtaining work permits hinder both economic independence and social inclusion (Fasani et al. 2020). Thus, shortening the ‘waiting period’ and providing employment support services early on can yield significant benefits, for both individuals and host communities.

Despite being one of the EU’s main entry points, Italy has long been an outlier when it comes to timely support. Its asylum system remains fragmented, heavily reliant on emergency accommodations (the so-called CAS centres), and often provides little or no help with job readiness. Asylum seekers are legally permitted to work after 60 days, but few receive meaningful assistance in finding employment. As a result, many spend years in limbo: legally able but practically unable to integrate into the labour market.

It is into this policy vacuum that the FORWORK pilot stepped in (Abbiati et al. 2025). Implemented between 2018 and 2021 in Northern Italy, its core idea is simple: offer early, personalised labour market support to asylum seekers, even before their refugee status is officially recognised.

What sets the FORWORK pilot apart is not just its early intervention model, but its implementation in one of the first-arrival countries, where such initiatives are rare and urgently needed. Most of what we know about refugee integration comes from Northern Europe and focuses on recognised refugees (e.g. Irastorza 2016 and Foged et al. 2022 for reviews of the evidence in Sweden and Denmark, respectively). By contrast, FORWORK tested whether entry-point countries can start building integration capacity from the outset, offering support before refugee status is even granted.

FORWORK offered a concrete model for active labour market policies tailored to refugees’ specific needs – rather than one-size-fits-all educational training or passive support – and was designed to assess if such a model can be timely and effective.

An Early-Integration Experiment

The pilot launched in Italy’s Piedmont region and was born from an ambitious alliance between public institutions, NGOs, and academic researchers. The pilot targeted a critical phase in the asylum process: the period soon after arrival, when most asylum seekers in the country receive little more than food and shelter. It focused on residents of CAS centres, where services are minimal and employment support is virtually nonexistent.

Participants were offered a tailored bundle of services: job mentoring, vocational guidance, language and civic education, and paid internships with local employers. The intervention began with a one-on-one session with a job mentor, who helped assess each asylum seeker’s skills and prior work experience using the EU Skills Profile Tool for Third Country Nationals. Together, mentors and mentees crafted a personalised plan aligned with the participant’s aspirations and occupational background. Mentors remained a steady point of contact, offering guidance, encouragement, and help navigating the Italian labour market.

The programme design allowed for a gold-standard evaluation. CAS centres were randomly assigned to treatment and control groups, making it possible to rigorously measure FORWORK’s impact. A total of 622 asylum seekers were offered participation, and two-thirds (409) accepted. Outcomes were tracked using administrative data, supplemented by two dedicated surveys conducted before and after the intervention.

Benefits: Employment, Language Proficiency, and Trust

In a recent working paper (Abbiati et al. 2025), we show that FORWORK participants were more likely to gain formal employment and stable contracts, and gains were larger for those who participated in subsidised internships. Despite disruptions from COVID-19 during the study period, remote one-on-one mentoring preserved much of the programme’s intended support, suggesting resilience even in other constrained or emergency contexts, not just in ideal conditions.

Over an 18-month follow-up period, the pilot led to a 30% net increase in employment. Figure 1 shows that participants’ employment rate was 10 percentage points higher than the control group (43% versus 33%), a striking 30% relative increase. Among men, employment rose by 15 points. Among women, who are typically harder to reach in such labour market interventions, employment rose by 8 to 10 points, nearly doubling their baseline rate. Women, African nationals, and individuals with no prior work experience were especially likely to engage with and benefit from mentoring.

Figure 1 Effects of job mentoring on employment

The quality of employment also improved. Participants were more likely to hold fixed-term or permanent contracts and reported higher monthly earnings (a 30% increase relative to the control group). Paid internships, offered to about 20% of participants, appeared to play a catalytic role, easing the transition from job search to regular employment. Crucially, these gains reflect real increases in employment and not just a shift from informal to formal jobs.In the absence of FORWORK, the data show that over 8% of asylum seekers in the target population would be working under verbal agreements or without contracts, leaving them exposed to exploitation and outside the protections of labour law. This is a striking figure, especially given how little is known about the extent to which newly arrived migrants are absorbed into informal labour markets.

There is more: the benefits of FORWORK extend beyond paychecks. As shown in Figure 2, language proficiency rose by 15 to 20 percentage points across comprehension, reading, and speaking. Participants also reported greater trust in Italians and more frequent social interaction with locals, as demonstrated in Figure 3. These are all signs that early labour market inclusion can also foster broader social integration in the new communities.

Costs and Scalability

One of FORWORK’s greatest strengths was its cost-effectiveness. The average cost per participant was just over €3,000, a figure in line with standard Italian labour market programmes for unemployed citizens. Nearly 80% of that spending went directly to services and staff, while only 6% covered internships. In other words, FORWORK did not require a new infrastructure or an extraordinary injection of public funds into subsidised employment. It leveraged existing local employment centres and trained job mentors to work with asylum seekers. The model is practical, replicable, and scalable in other countries, provided there is political will and minimal institutional coordination.

What Policymakers Should Know: ‘Early’ Matters

For policymakers looking to reduce the fiscal and social costs of asylum reception, the case for early labour market integration is compelling. The FORWORK pilot stands out as one of the few randomised evaluations of refugee labour market interventions in Europe. While not a silver bullet, it offers a practical, evidence-based model for doing better with modest means. Its core lesson is simple but powerful: early, targeted support can dramatically improve employment outcomes for asylum seekers, even in resource-constrained settings.

This challenges the status quo in many EU countries, where integration services are often delayed until after refugee status is formally granted. But these delays carry real costs: prolonged inactivity erodes skills, dampens motivation, and fosters perceptions of dependency. Worse, it can deprive local economies of much-needed labour, particularly in sectors facing persistent shortages. Delayed integration also raises the risk of informal employment and, in some cases, involvement in criminal activities. These outcomes feed public resentment and fuel political backlash against asylum policies.

We have learnt from FORWORK that these outcomes are not inevitable. With relatively modest investments and thoughtful design, it’s possible to accelerate integration and deliver tangible benefits for both asylum seekers and host communities. Better services don’t necessarily attract more arrivals: they may just improve the prospects of those already present, helping them become self-sufficient sooner. And they may offer a more sustainable alternative to costlier, less effective approaches, such as long-term housing subsidies (Tamin et al. 2025).

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli shell slammed into the compound of the only Catholic church in the Gaza Strip on Thursday, killing three people and wounding 10 others, including the parish priest, according to church officials. The late Pope Francis, who died in April, had regularly spoken to the priest about the war's toll on civilians.

The shelling of the Holy Family Catholic Church in Gaza also damaged the church compound, where hundreds of Palestinians have been sheltering from the 21-month Israel-Hamas war. Israel expressed regret over what it described as an accident and said it was investigating.

Pope Leo XIV on Thursday renewed his call for an immediate ceasefire in response to the attack.

In a telegram of condolences for the victims, Leo expressed ""his profound hope for dialogue, reconciliation and enduring peace in the region."" The pope said he was ""deeply saddened to learn of the loss of life and injury caused by the military attack,"" and expressed his closeness to the wounded priest, Rev. Gabriel Romanelli, and the entire parish.

President Donald Trump called Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to express his frustration over the strike on the church, the White House said. Netanyahu later released a statement saying Israel ""deeply regrets that a stray ammunition hit Gaza's Holy Family Church.""

Hundreds of people sheltered at the church

The church compound was sheltering both Christians and Muslims, including a number of children with disabilities, according to Fadel Naem, acting director of Al-Ahli Hospital, which received the casualties.

The Catholic charity Caritas Jerusalem said the parish's 60-year-old janitor and an 84-year-old woman receiving psychosocial support inside a Caritas tent in the church compound were killed in the attack. Parish priest Romanelli was lightly wounded.

""We were struck in the church while all the people there were elders, innocent people and children,"" said Shady Abu Dawood, whose mother was wounded by shrapnel to her head. ""We love peace and call for it, and this is a brutal, unjustified action by the Israeli occupation.""

The Israeli military said an initial assessment indicated that ""fragments from a shell fired during operational activity in the area hit the church mistakenly."" It said it was still investigating.

The military said it only strikes militant targets, ""makes every feasible effort to mitigate harm to civilians and religious structures, and regrets any unintentional damage caused to them.""

Israel has repeatedly struck schools, shelters, hospitals and other civilian buildings, accusing Hamas militants of sheltering inside and blaming them for civilian deaths. Palestinians say nowhere has felt safe since Israel launched its offensive in response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni blamed Israel for the strike on the church. ""The attacks on the civilian population that Israel has been demonstrating for months are unacceptable,"" she said.

Church compounds have been struck before

The church is just a stone's throw from Al-Ahli Hospital, Naem said, noting that the area around both the church and the hospital has been repeatedly struck for over a week.

The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem, which also has a church in Gaza that previously sustained damage from Israeli strikes, said the Holy Family Church was sheltering 600 displaced people, including many children, and 54 people with disabilities. It said the building suffered significant damage.

Targeting a holy site ""is a blatant affront to human dignity and a grave violation of the sanctity of life and the inviolability of religious sites, which are meant to serve as safe havens during times of war,"" the Church said in a statement.

Separately, another person was killed and 17 wounded Thursday in a strike against two schools sheltering displaced people in the Al-Bureij refugee camp in central Gaza, according to Al-Awda Hospital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on the strike.

The Gaza Health Ministry said that over the past 24 hours, local hospitals received the bodies of 94 people killed in Israeli strikes and another 367 wounded.

Pope Francis spoke almost daily with Gaza church

In the last 18 months of his life, Francis would often call the lone Catholic church in the Gaza Strip to see how people huddled inside were coping with a devastating war.

Francis had repeatedly criticized Israel's wartime conduct, and last year suggested that allegations of genocide in Gaza — which Israel has rejected as a ""blood libel"" — should be investigated. The late pope also met with the families of Israeli hostages and called for their release.

Only 1,000 Christians live in Gaza, an overwhelmingly Muslim territory, according to the U.S. State Department's international religious freedom report for 2024. Most are Greek Orthodox.

The Holy Land's Christian population has dwindled in recent decades as many have emigrated to escape war and conflict or to seek better opportunities abroad. Local Christian leaders have recently denounced attacks by Israeli settlers and Jewish extremists.

Ceasefire talks continue

There has been little visible progress in months of indirect talks between Israel and Hamas aimed at a new ceasefire and hostage release agreement, after Israel ended an earlier truce in March.

According to an Israeli official familiar with the details, Israel is showing ""flexibility"" on some of the issues that have challenged negotiators, including Israel's presence in some of the security corridors the military has carved into the territory.

The official, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were discussing ongoing negotiations, said Israel has shown some willingness to compromise on the Morag Corridor, which cuts across southern Gaza. However, other issues remain, including the list of Palestinian prisoners to be freed by Israel and commitments to end the war.

The official says there are signs of optimism but there won't be a deal immediately.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack and abducted 251 people, most of whom have since been released in ceasefire agreements or other deals. Fifty hostages are still being held, less than half of them believed to be alive

Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 58,600 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which has said women and children make up more than half of the dead. It does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its tally.

The ministry is part of the Hamas-run government but is led by medical professionals. The United Nations and other international organizations consider its figures to be the most reliable count of war casualties.

809,8,Israeli demolition threat looms over vital Jenin disability rehab centre,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/16/israeli-demolition-threat-looms-over-vital-jenin-disability-rehab-centre,2025-07-16T19:47:13Z,Al Jazeera English,US,refugee,"Al-Jaleel NGO provides vital aid to disabled Palestinians but faces demolition under Israeli military plans in Jenin.

The Al-Jaleel Society for Care and Community-based Rehabilitation has provided essential services to disabled Palestinians in Jenin refugee camp for decades. But now, after repeated Israeli attacks, the centre has been destroyed, and its staff have discovered that it sits in an Israeli-designated demolition zone.

Al-Jaleel’s staff have received no official notice, but in early June, the Israeli army published an aerial map showing several buildings in the area that were set to be destroyed, including the rehabilitation centre.

Zaid Am-Ali, senior advocacy officer for Palestine operations at Humanity and Inclusion, Al-Jaleel’s partner organisation, told Al Jazeera the reason the organisations were given was that the area was being secured for military and security purposes.

“This is not the first time the centre has been targeted, the Israeli military has destroyed parts of it during previous acts of demolition in the refugee camp and has breached and ransacked the centre and tampered with assistive devices meant for persons with disabilities,” Am-Ali said.

Al Jazeera has reached out to the Israeli military but has not received a response at the time of publication.

Supporting thousands of Palestinians

Al-Jaleel is a “critical lifeline”, Am-Ali said, describing how the demolition of the centre would deprive vulnerable communities in Jenin and the wider northern West Bank of its essential services.

It was established in 1991 as the Local Rehabilitation Committee, which became an independent NGO in 2010 under the name Al-Jaleel.

Since it first opened its doors, Al-Jaleel has provided thousands of Palestinians with a wide range of support and services, especially to those with mobility impairments resulting from injury, illness, or conflict-related trauma.

As well as prosthetics, orthotics and physical and occupational therapies, Al-Jaleel also offers psychological support for those affected by disability and continuing violent assaults perpetrated by the Israeli military, which has been attacking Jenin on a regular basis for years, but has intensified operations since the start of 2025.

“This is the same area that has been subject to an ongoing Israeli military operation for years now, causing a lot of casualties and damage to civilian infrastructure,” Am-Ali said.

Al-Jaleel’s ability to function and provide care was severely compromised in April when an Israeli attack damaged the building.

Although staff have since relocated and started operating from another location due to their displacement from the camp, they have not yet been permitted to re-enter the organisation’s original building to retrieve any equipment that was spared during the April attack.

Staff were told they would be allowed to evacuate their equipment on July 12, but were then not allowed to do so by the Israeli military.

It is unclear when or if staff will be able to collect Al-Jaleel’s belongings before the demolition takes place. With the area now declared a closed military zone, Al-Jaleel’s staff are being denied information about the building’s status.

At the time of writing, the centre has not been demolished, but other buildings in its vicinity have been torn down.

Violence in Jenin

Violence in Jenin has escalated significantly since January 21, when the Israeli military launched “Operation Iron Wall” in the city and the nearby refugee camp.

According to Israeli forces, the operation is an “antiterrorism” offensive, attempting to crush Palestinian resistance efforts in the area.

The Israeli military has for years attempted to root out any form of armed resistance in the occupied West Bank, conducting raids that have escalated in severity since the beginning of Israel’s war on Gaza in October 2023. At least 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli forces or settlers in that period.

“Operation Iron Wall” – targeting Palestinian fighters in the northern West Bank – started in Jenin, but has since spread to Tulkarem, Nur Shams, and al-Fara refugee camps.

On March 22, just 60 days after the beginning of the offensive, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported that 40,000 Palestinian refugees had been displaced from refugee camps in the northern West Bank.

In addition, earlier this year, Israeli authorities announced that they planned to wipe out the Jenin refugee camp completely.

Since then, Israeli bulldozers have been tearing down commercial buildings and homes at an alarming rate.

Wafa, the Palestinian news agency, reported on June 30 that more than 600 homes and 15 roads in Jenin camp had been demolished.

On June 17, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected a petition filed by Adalah, a legal centre for Palestinian minority rights in Israel, on June 12 to halt the demolition of Jenin refugee camp.

The Supreme Court authorised the Israeli military to proceed with the destruction of nearly 90 civilian buildings that housed hundreds of Palestinian families.

“The Israeli Supreme Court’s decision to uphold these operations, including its 7 May 2025 rejection of Adalah’s petition against the mass demolitions in Nur Shams and Tulkarem refugee camps, provides a false legal cover for policies of forced displacement and entrenched impunity,” said Adalah.

Bigger picture

The potential demolition of Al-Jaleel fits into a wider pattern of Israeli attacks on Palestinian healthcare institutions.

The targeting of health facilities, medical personnel and patients has been widespread during Israel’s war on Gaza. These actions are considered war crimes under the 1949 Geneva Convention. Israel has justified the attacks as being part of its fight against Hamas and other armed groups, accusing them, without any overwhelming evidence, of using health facilities as cover for their bases and operations.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), at least 94 percent of all hospitals in Gaza are damaged or destroyed.

Between October 7, 2023, and July 2, 2025, WHO recorded 863 attacks on healthcare in the West Bank. These attacks affected 203 institutions and 589 health transports

In a statement to Al Jazeera, WHO reported that, of the 476 government health service delivery units assessed by WHO and partners in the West Bank in June 2025, only 345 are fully functional, 112 are partially functional, nine are non-functional, and 1 has been destroyed.

That, Am-Ali believes, is being overlooked amid the understandable focus on Gaza, where Israel has killed more than 58,000 Palestinians. And it is allowing Israel to get away with its devastation of Palestinian life in the West Bank, and its destruction of vital centres like Al-Jaleel.

“These developments are not isolated incidents and are in clear violation of international law, including the prohibition on the acquisition of territory by force under the UN Charter and the Fourth Geneva Convention,” he said.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

BBC More than 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were killed by Bosnian Serb forces in Srebrenica in July 1995. Today remembrance is fraught

The silence is shattered by a guttural scream. A group of people scrabble on the ground, sifting through the soil. One of them holds up a watch they have uncovered; another, a sandal. The scene on stage at Sarajevo's War Theatre is uncomfortably familiar for the audience at the world premiere of the Flowers of Srebrenica. The play reflects the grim reality of the events not just of July 1995 – but the ensuing decades of unresolved grief and divisions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Srebrenica massacre remains the most notorious war crime committed in Europe since World War Two. Bosnian-Serb forces overran Srebrenica in eastern Bosnia, where thousands of Bosniaks, who are mostly Muslim, had taken refuge, believing they were safely under the protection of the United Nations. Instead, Dutch soldiers stood aside as Bosnian-Serb General Ratko Mladić directed his troops to place women and the youngest children on buses for transport to majority-Bosniak areas. Then, over the following days, he oversaw the systematic murder of around 8,000 people – most, but not all of them, men and boys.

Raisa Šehu Many victims of the massacre were identified by their clothing, in this production by the Sarajevo War Theatre, LegalAliens and Mess Festival

Mladić's troops dumped the bodies in mass graves. But later, to cover up their crimes, they exhumed then reburied the remains in multiple sites. As a result, body parts were distributed across multiple graves, causing endless anguish for the victims' families. Many of them are still searching for their relatives' remains decades later, though DNA testing has helped thousands of families to bury their family members at Potočari Cemetery, adjacent to the former UN base. Others have been able to identify body parts through scraps of clothing or personal belongings – as depicted in scenes in the Flowers of Srebrenica. The play also reflects the apparently deepening divisions in contemporary Bosnia and Herzegovina. While the audience in Sarajevo delivers a standing ovation to the cast and crew, in majority-Serb Republika Srpska, political leaders repeatedly deny that genocide took place at Srebrenica, despite Mladić's conviction for the offence at an international tribunal in The Hague, as well as the earlier conviction of the Bosnian-Serb political leader Radovan Karadžić. ""I thought that when 30 years passed, we'd come to our senses,"" says Selma Alispahić, the lead actress of the Sarajevo War Theatre – herself a former refugee from Bosnia's conflict.

""People get tired of proving the truth that's been proven so many times, even in international courts. The story of the hatred and spinning of facts serves only the criminals who profited from the war and who want to preserve their fortune today."" Genocide denial is not the only symptom of the country's divisions. The Dayton Peace agreement brought an end to the war, just four months after the massacre. But it also divided Bosnia and Herzegovina into two ""entities"", on ethnic grounds. Most Bosniaks and Croats live in the Federation, while the majority of Serbs are in Republika Srpska. There is also a state-level government, with a member of the presidency for each of the three main ethnic groups. But most of the power lies at the entity level. In recent months, Republika Srpska's president has been exploiting that to make mischief. Milorad Dodik has been pushing through legislation to withdraw from numerous national institutions, including the judiciary. This has brought him into conflict with Bosnia's ultimate power, the international High Representative. The current holder of that position, Christian Schmidt, annulled the laws concerned. But Dodik refused to recognise those rulings. Earlier this year a court sentenced him to a year in prison and a six-year ban from public office for ignoring the High Representative's decisions. The verdict is currently under appeal. Further shenanigans have ensued – including legislation to establish a ""reserve police force"". The same terminology was used for murderous Serb militia during Bosnia's conflict. ""This is dangerous, playing with the memory of those who have experienced the 1990s,"" says Mr Schmidt. ""I see the irresponsible part of the political class playing with this. We need a clear presence of the international community on a military level – so Eufor [the EU peacekeeping force] gets more responsibility in the sheer presence, promising people they will be supported in a peaceful manner.""

The international High Representative for Bosnia Christian Schmidt says some political figures are acting irresponsibly

In the centre of Sarajevo, reminders of the anniversary of the Srebrenica massacre are hard to miss. Hundreds of people huddled under umbrellas in the pouring rain to pay their respects to the convoy carrying the remains of seven recently-identified victims who will be buried at Potočari Cemetery during the commemoration. Outside the city's shopping centres, video screens urge passers-by to ""Remember Srebrenica"". But just 15 minutes up the road, in East Sarajevo, there are no public references to the massacre. The Cyrillic script signs and Jelen Beer umbrellas indicate that this is Republika Srpska. And in the entity government's building, there is little enthusiasm for the commemorations. Indeed, state-level foreign trade minister Staša Košarac – a leading member of Dodik's SNSD party – claims that Srebrenica is used to deepen divisions and prevent reconciliation. ""In this country, Bosniaks, Croats and Serbs were killed – and crimes were committed on all three sides. It's important, when thinking about the future, that all the perpetrators, on all sides, should be held accountable,"" he says. ""Bosniaks insist on talking only about Bosniak victims. A crime has been committed in Srebrenica – no Serbs deny that – but we have the right to point out the crimes against Serbs in and around Srebrenica."" But thousands of other people are focusing on solidarity with Srebrenica. On the eve of the commemoration, the Memorial Centre and Potočari Cemetery were already busy with people paying their respects. And they cheered the arrival from around the country of groups of cyclists, runners and motorcyclists.

811,67,"Stuck in transit, African migrants struggle to survive in Tunis",https://dpa-international.com/trends-and-features/urn:newsml:dpa.com:20090101:250715-99-461046/,2025-08-04T06:11:38Z,Dpa-international.com,US,refugee,"Ahmed Barry, a 24-year-old from Guinea, is struggling to control a broken water nozzle while washing a small car, as water flows from holes in the hose onto his shirt.

Unconcerned by how wet his clothes are getting, he continues to spray the water, while his colleague Ali Moriba, also from Guinea, stirs soap in an old bucket.

The two men are living and working in Tunisia, which has become a major transit point for the tens of thousands of sub-Saharan Africans fleeing violence and poverty every year in hope of reaching Europe.

They work at a car wash in Ettahrir district, in the western part of Tunis. It's the only one still operating in the area, as the other two closed due to staff shortages as well as water restrictions imposed due to the drought.

But business is slow and further hampered by old equipment, which in turn affects the wages the men are paid for a day's work.

That day, their boss told them to stop washing until he could fix the holes. If he does not, they will leave early and get paid for a half day, or around $5 per person, until the water gun is replaced.

""Ali and I have been working here for only a few weeks,"" Barry tells dpa while trying to wring the water from his shirt.

""The situation is difficult, but we need to work to buy food and pay rent. I don't know how long we will stay or what will happen tomorrow, but I hope that one day we will succeed in reaching Europe.""

They live in the al-Zohour neighbourhood, around two kilometres from their work, in a two-room apartment with five other migrants from Guinea and Nigeria, most of whom work in construction in Ariana, a region that is home to a large concentration of sub-Saharan African workers.

The car wash manager, a man in his 50s, says that most of the African workers don't stay with him for long.

""They either migrate or get arrested. Life is difficult in Tunisia, and they don't last for long,"" he told dpa.

Life has become even harder since 2023, when Tunisia struck a deal with the European Union aimed at curbing migration flows. Authorities launched a large-scale clampdown on the influx of migrants into Tunisian cities, particularly in the Sfax region.

This led to a gradual decline in numbers in the centre of Tunis and other major cities, as many chose to avoid security forces by living in working-class areas or on farms.

At the time, hostility and harassment towards migrants intensified after President Kais Saied accused them of bringing ""violence, crime and unacceptable behaviour"" into the country. Clashes erupted between residents and migrants, at times turning fatal.

Last year, authorities expanded their crackdown by dismantling the largest camp in Tunis, in the upscale Lac region, near the offices of the UN refugee agency UNHCR and the International Organization for Migration. The camp was said to have housed thousands of undocumented migrants. This year, more camps have been dismantled near Sfax.

Such measures have made it more difficult for African migrants to find work and housing. Many women are forced to beg in the streets or sell items like tissues.

Outside the centre of Tunis however, authorities are relatively lenient. The Bhar Lazreg area, in the coastal Marsa suburb, has become a haven for a significant number of sub-Saharan migrants.

There, Karim spends long hours in the streets every day, collecting plastic bottles from trash bins to sell at a local landfill site, which in turn sends them to recycling plants.

The young man from Cameroon, who prefers to use a pseudonym for security reasons, earns 30 cents per kilogram of plastic.

""Things are going well, as planned. I'm trying to save money because we are transit migrants here. I once tried to cross the Mediterranean, but the coastguard caught me and sent me away from the capital to the desert,"" Karim said.

""I spent two weeks before returning to Tunis. I'm working here, and now I have to save money and try my luck again,"" he added.

But the goal of Karim and thousands of desperate migrants in Tunisia will not be easy, as the coast guard has intensified surveillance and patrolling operations, using European equipment along with tougher judicial penalties against those involved in human trafficking.

In 2024, the migrant influx from Tunisia to Italy declined by nearly 80% compared to 2023, according to official Italian data. The decline continued at the same pace in the first quarter of this year.

The uncertain future is forcing an increasing number of migrants to voluntarily return to their countries of origin, rather than await their fate in Tunisia.

A National Guard spokesman told dpa that some 3,500 irregular migrants had voluntarily returned to their home countries by May, as part of a programme which organizes two flights per week, supervised by the International Organization for Migration, in cooperation with Tunisian authorities and donor countries.

We're delighted to reveal the names of the 25 talented photographers who won AAP Magazine #24: Portrait.

""The most difficult thing for me is a portrait. You have to try and put your camera between the skin of a person and his shirt."" - Henry Cartier-Bresson.

The most common definition of portrait photography is: from identifying to the most sensitive approach of capturing emotions, (including its ability to heighten the model or to educate the viewer) portrait photography is strengthened by a wide variety of forms and practices. It transcends the posed studio shots or the common family portraits to become a genre in its own right that allows photographers to express their full creativity.

Describe, reveal, embellish, question, disturb... a portrait can inspire many different reactions. But if there are indeed a thousand faces to photograph, we can only showcase some of them, and this new edition of AAP Magazine focuses on the vision of 25 photographers from 14 different countries and 4 continents!

Each one of them reveals their personal narrative and different approach to portrait photography.

22 July 2025 Share Save Mariam Issimdar BBC News, Essex Share Save

PA Media The local council leader urged the Home Office to remove asylum seekers from the Bell Hotel in Epping, warning protests were in danger of becoming more volatile

A council leader has called for control over protests outside a hotel used to house asylum seekers, describing it as a ""powder keg"" situation. Epping Forest District Council's Conservative leader Chris Whitbread was speaking after more than 1,000 people gathered outside The Bell Hotel in the town in separate protests over two nights last week. Far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, had said he would attend a further planned protest at the hotel. In an interview with BBC Newsnight's Victoria Derbyshire, Whitbread said: ""My concerns are for next week, or this week, if Tommy Robinson turns up... We really have got to get this back under control.""

The protests followed the arrest and charge of an asylum seeker on suspicion of alleged sexual assaults in the town. Whitbread repeated calls for the hotel to stop housing asylum seekers following the incident. Six people have been arrested following the latest protest with one man accused of violent disorder. Whitbread said there were concerns about the location which is near a school and the town centre. ""Fair-minded people within the local community, initially protesting peacefully, want the hotel closed,"" he said. ""I have to say, as the leader of the council, that's always been my position and the council's position. This is just not a suitable location. The sooner it's dealt with, the better."" He said he sympathised with the ""vulnerable"" asylum seekers at the hotel but stressed locations which had ""less impact on established communities"" needed to be found by the Home Office. ""It's a powder keg now and we need to get something done and we need the Home Office to listen,"" he added. Asked if he had a message for Mr Yaxley-Lennon and his supporters, Whitbread said: ""Keep away, [you're] not welcome here in Epping Forest. ""What we want to do is make sure our town stays peaceful and people can enjoy their lives here. That's the most important message to get through."" Mr Yaxley-Lennon has been contacted for comment.

BBC Newsnight Epping Forest district Council leader, Chris Whitbread made his comments warning of a ""powder keg"" situation to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire

Roger Hirst, the police, fire and crime commissioner for Essex, said he had written to the home secretary asking for a meeting and ""clarity"" about the suitability of The Bell Hotel - and also about one other hotel being used for asylum seekers in the district. ""These large-scale protests are disrupting local life and placing an unsustainable burden on Essex Police resources."" On Monday, Downing Street said the scenes at Epping were ""clearly unacceptable"".

PA Media There have been a number of demonstrations outside the Bell Hotel in Epping, which is housing asylum seekers

A Home Office spokeswoman had told the BBC the asylum system was under ""unprecedented strain"". ""That was the situation the government inherited, but we have begun to restore order,"" she said. Essex Police said it was disappointed to see the protest escalate into ""mindless thuggery"" after one officer was struck in the face with a bottle and taken to hospital for treatment.

Nigel Farage has called on the police to release the immigration status of suspects charged with crimes following the arrest of two men in connection with the alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl in Warwickshire. The Reform UK party leader said he ""absolutely"" thinks such details should be released when asked about the matter at a news conference on Monday. It has been reported that the two men charged in connection with the alleged rape in Nuneaton last month are Afghan nationals but the police have not confirmed this. Warwickshire Police said once someone is charged with an offence, the force follows national guidance that does not include sharing ethnicity or immigration status.

The authorised professional practice followed by forces across the country, and cited by the College of Policing, says the same. Asked by a reporter at the news conference in Westminster whether police should release the names, addresses and immigration statuses of suspects after they have been charged with a crime, Farage said: ""What caused unrest on our streets after Southport last year was us not being told the status of the attacker. ""That led to crazy conspiracy theories spreading online."" Last year's deadly attack in Southport, in which three young girls were murdered, led to the spreading of a false claim online that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. Linking a perceived lack of information from police about Nuneaton to what happened in Southport last July, Farage continued: ""To have masses of speculation as to what might have happened makes things I think far worse than they otherwise would be"". Asked to clarify his thoughts further on whether he thought police forces should be obliged to publish such details, he said: ""Yes, I absolutely think that they should."" Later in the news conference, Farage called the police's decision not to release details about the alleged Nuneaton attackers a ""cover-up that in many ways is reminiscent of what happened after the Southport killings last year."" ""It is not... in any way at all a contempt of court for the British public to know the identity of those who allegedly have committed serious crimes,"" he added. ""I felt that in the wake of the Southport attacks, and I feel that ever more strongly today.""",NewsAPI,-1.35,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,44.7,"bbc news, BBC, British Broadcasting Corporation, bbc.com, bbc.co.uk, bbcnews, bbc",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/bbc/,https://ground.news/interest/bbc-news_bf95f4,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/bbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.0),HIGH (0.8),United Kingdom,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Center,British Public,1922,-0.8,Center,Very High,Center,Lean Left,Left,Center,Center,bbc.com,,bbc news,15,United Kingdom,Y,E,BBC News,

Dame Angela Eagle, a Home Office minister, said the Government “doesn’t want absolutely every phone” from those who cross the Channel.

Ministers unveiled a plan in January to crack down on people-smuggling by allowing Border Force and immigration enforcement to compel new arrivals to hand over their devices.

The proposal in the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill was aimed at helping investigators to identify and track down people-smugglers organising Channel crossings.

It would reverse a High Court ruling last year, which said the Home Office had been unlawfully operating a blanket policy of seizing phones from people arriving on small boats.

Officials were found to not have parliamentary authority to extract data from phones or retain the devices. Doing so had meant those affected were unable to contact family members or access documentation.

Dame Angela said the Home Office would not be seeking the phones of every migrant who arrived on a small boat.

She told Times Radio: “The Bill, which is in the House of Lords at the moment, will enable us to target those that we think are facilitating.

“So we don’t want absolutely every phone, but we do want the phones of the people that we think are organising and facilitating, and this extra money will enable us to do much quicker analytics of the phones that we seize.

“But of course, we’ve got to get the Border Security Bill on the statute book to give us those extra powers.”

The Home Office has announced that an extra £100m will be spent on tackling people-smuggling, as protests outside asylum hotels continue across the country.

Some of the money will support the “one in, one out” returns agreement pilot with France, and some will go towards funding extended police powers to seize digital devices.

Demonstrators outside hotels in London, Newcastle and Epping in Essex have called for the sites not to be used to house migrants.

Asked on Sky News what her message was to protesters, Dame Angela said: “Anger doesn’t get you anywhere.

“What we have to do is recognise the values we have in this country, the rule of law we have in this country, the work we’re doing with the police to protect people.

“We will close asylum hotels by the end of the Parliament. We’ll do it faster if we can.”

818,270,LEGO’s Three-Storey Modular Arkham Asylum Set Brings Batman’s Rogues Gallery To Life,https://www.yankodesign.com/2025/07/25/legos-three-storey-modular-arkham-asylum-set-brings-batmans-rogues-gallery-to-life/,2025-07-25T19:15:07Z,Yanko Design,US,asylum,"The moment I saw LEGO’s new Arkham Asylum set, I knew this was something special. After years of smaller Batman builds, we finally get the massive 2,953-piece institution that feels worthy of Gotham’s most dangerous criminals. Standing over 12 inches tall, this isn’t just another licensed set—it’s a proper architectural statement that captures the foreboding presence of the asylum perfectly. The three-story modular design means you can actually split it apart and rearrange sections, which opens up endless display possibilities. For $299.99, you’re getting serious value when you consider the piece count and that impressive lineup of 16 minifigures.

I love how LEGO has handled the interior spaces. The prison cells actually open, the walls come apart for easy access, and there are genuine sightlines throughout the entire structure. You can peer into different sections and create your own scenes with all those villains they’ve packed in. The transparent support pieces let you pose Batman swooping down from the roof or have characters seemingly floating mid-escape. The inclusion of an inmate transport van adds that perfect external detail that makes the whole setup feel complete.

Designer: LEGO

The minifigure roster reads like a greatest hits album of Batman lore. Batman, Robin, Batwoman, and the newcomer Batwing represent the good guys, while nearly every major villain gets representation. Joker, Harley Quinn, Riddler, Poison Ivy, Catwoman, Scarecrow, Bane, Killer Croc, Penguin, and Mr. Freeze—that’s practically the entire rogues gallery in one box. The two security guards round out the cast perfectly, giving you those essential background characters that make institutional settings feel authentic. With 65 stickers referencing comic book lore scattered throughout, every corner tells a story.

The advent calendar feature might sound gimmicky, but it’s actually quite cool. Instead of facing down nearly 3,000 pieces in one overwhelming session, you can build this gradually over 24 days leading up to Christmas. Each day reveals new sections and details, turning construction into a month-long event rather than a weekend marathon. This allows you to truly appreciate the clever building techniques and design choices LEGO incorporated throughout. It transforms what could be an exhausting build into something you can savor and anticipate daily.

LEGO Insiders get early access starting September 9th, with general availability following September 12th. Given how quickly major Batman sets tend to sell out, especially ones with this kind of minifigure count, getting on that early access list seems essential.

The timing is pretty great for holiday gifting, though honestly, this feels more like something you’d want to keep for yourself. The modular design means it works equally well as a display piece or an active play set. The set really feels like an authentic and faithful recreation of the asylum, and does seem to be a really exciting LEGO experience. It honors the dark atmosphere of the source material, while offering creative possibilities that will keep you hooked.

FAQs

1. What makes the LEGO Arkham Asylum set unique compared to other LEGO Batman sets?

The LEGO Arkham Asylum features an impressive modular, three-story design, allowing builders to split and rearrange sections for custom displays. It includes a massive 2,953 pieces and an exciting lineup of 16 minifigures, featuring nearly every major Batman villain alongside core heroes. Unique to this set is its advent calendar build option, letting you construct it over 24 days for a more immersive experience. The combination of architectural detail, playability, and collectability makes it a centerpiece for both Batman fans and LEGO enthusiasts.

2. How difficult is it to build the LEGO Arkham Asylum set, and is it suitable for adult collectors?

This set is designed with adult builders and advanced LEGO fans in mind. With nearly 3,000 pieces and intricate modular construction, it offers a rewarding challenge that goes beyond standard playsets. The build process involves detailed interiors, clever techniques, and a focus on display quality. While experienced younger builders can enjoy it, the complexity and scale make it especially appealing for adult collectors seeking a substantial and visually pleasing addition to their LEGO or Batman collection.

3. Can the LEGO Arkham Asylum set be customized or expanded with other modular LEGO buildings?

Yes, the Arkham Asylum set is fully compatible with LEGO’s modular building system. Its base and connection points allow you to integrate it with other modular sets or custom creations, making it easy to expand your Gotham City display. Builders often add custom interiors, exterior landscaping, or connect it with other city or superhero-themed modulars. The set’s design encourages creativity and personalization, making it a flexible foundation for larger LEGO layouts.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,"yanko design, YankoDesign, yankodesign.com, yanko design magazine",not found,,not found,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,yankodesign.com,,yanko design,266,USA,,,,
819,266,Cloning Came to Polo. Then Things Got Truly Uncivilized,https://www.wired.com/story/cloning-came-to-polo-things-got-uncivilized-cambiaso/,2025-07-10T10:00:00Z,Wired,US,asylum,"To play polo at the highest level, you have to love horses or be filthy rich. Ideally both. A team might field around 40 ponies for each game and draw on a roster of hundreds of potentially playable horses for each tournament. In the gaps between tournaments, top players scour the globe for new equine talent—trying to snaffle foals from elite bloodlines or looking to ex-racehorses to uncover a polo star in the rough.

Andrey Borodin, the billionaire patron of Park Place Polo, wears the No. 1 jersey for his team during a match at the 2025 US Open. Video: Gabriella Angotti-Jones

Traditional horse breeding is a lottery: Throw together even your best mare and stallion and there’s no way of knowing how their genetics will combine. Their filly could be a dud, and you’d still have to wait several years to know for sure. You take care of the horse, stable it, feed it for two years before you even try to ride it. Then you teach it to change leads, listen to your legs, turn on a dime, and go from 30 mph to zero without injuring itself. All along you pay for vets, grooms, farriers, breakers, feed, transport, and tack. You’re talking tens of thousands of dollars each year. Finally around age 5, the pony is ready for its first polo match. So you take the horse to the field and … it spooks as soon as it takes its first bump from another pony. Now you have an unenviable choice. Do you sink another 10 grand into training, or sell the mare at a steep discount?

Then there are the players: In Argentina, polo is arguably second only to soccer as the sport of national obsession. The top polo players are household names; those who venture into the international polo circuit are known as “hired assassins.” Nearly every top-ranked polo player is from Argentina, and so are the sport’s best horses.

“Thank you Alan,” Cambiaso wrote Meeker. “I feel safe with you.”

All of this is why polo depends on a system of patronage. Teams are bankrolled by wealthy sponsors, who hire the best Argentine assassins while keeping them supplied with Argentine ponies, bridles, bandages, reins, saddles, trailers, trucks, helmets, mallets, kneeguards, and the thousand other expenses a polo team might incur. In return, the patron, a polo amateur, gets to play on the team.

Finally, a handicap system keeps this delicate dance of money and skill in motion. Polo players are assigned a rating that corresponds to their skill. The highest is 10—Cambiaso is one of fewer than a dozen such players in the world—and the lowest is a complete novice at –2. Most patrons hover around a handicap of 0. The summed handicaps of all four players on a team cannot exceed a certain number, essentially guaranteeing a mix of amateurs, up-and-comers, and seasoned professional players.

In the mid-2010s, just as Cambiaso was trying out his first clones on the polo field, a new patron emerged on the US polo scene. A former president of the Bank of Moscow, Andrey Borodin fled his native Russia in 2011, finding political asylum in the UK, where he bought Park Place—a palatial 18th-century estate that once belonged to the father of King George III. The reported £140 million ($187 million) that Borodin paid for Park Place made it the most expensive home ever sold in the UK at the time.

Park Place also lent its name to Borodin’s new polo team, which the Russian exile started to fill with some of the world’s best players and ponies. Aristocratically pale and with the hint of a paunch filling out his royal blue and yellow jersey, Borodin himself played with a handicap of 0. Thanks largely to his skills off the polo field, the Russian billionaire patron and his team began to shake up the English polo scene, winning the 2017 Royal Windsor Cup—as Queen Elizabeth II watched from the stands—before turning to high-goal matches in the US. From almost nothing, Borodin was building Park Place into a formidable new force in elite polo, largely with the sheer power of his fortune. Borodin had the money to buy the best horses on the planet. But he still lacked an edge that Cambiaso had—one that wasn’t for sale.",NewsAPI,-7.29,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,37.18,"wired, Wired Magazine, wired.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/wired-magazine/,https://ground.news/interest/wired,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/wired,LEFT-CENTER (-3.0),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Left,,,-4.07,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,wired.com,,wired,52,USA,,,,

A ruling by the EU's top court has dealt a further blow to Italy's attempts to create a fast-track system in Albania for processing asylum applications offshore. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has said that the way the Italian government currently defines whether a country is ""safe"" to return someone whose application is rejected contravenes EU law. That ""safe country"" concept is central to the deal that Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni struck with Albania in 2023 to send migrants intercepted at sea straight there for accelerated processing. Anyone from a ""safe country"" who was refused asylum was supposed to be deported within a week.

But the ECJ has ruled that a nation can only be included on the government's list if the entire population there is safe, which means Italy will have to revise its procedure. It currently identifies Egypt and Bangladesh, for example, as safe, whilst accepting that certain groups there require protection.

The ruling brought an angry reaction from the government in Rome which said the European court was overstepping its role, adding that the decision would weaken the ability of countries to ""defend national borders"". The European court also said that the government must make public any evidence and sources it uses in reaching its conclusions on safe countries, so that asylum seekers can challenge the decision in their cases. ""Today, the court makes clear that a country cannot be designated as safe unless it offers effective, generalised protection, for everyone and everywhere, and unless that claim can be independently verified and challenged,"" Katia Scannavini of ActionAid Italy explained. ""The so-called Albania model collapses at its legal core,"" she argued. The fate of Italy's Albania project is being watched closely by other governments including in the UK which are keen on handling asylum applications offshore as they try to reduce the number of irregular migrants arriving in their countries. Meant as the centrepiece of Meloni's tough approach to immigration, the Albania deal has hit legal obstacles from the very start. The handful of migrants who were sent there were all eventually returned to Italy after the intervention of lawyers. Many times over budget, the centres that were built have never yet been used as intended.

LONDON — The earliest-known depiction of the 1066 Battle of Hastings — which began the Norman Conquest, changing England's ethnic mix and history forever — is coming home for the first time in 900 or so years.

The Bayeux Tapestry looks like a 224-foot medieval comic strip with scenes from that iconic 1066 battle, when William, Duke of Normandy — better known as William the Conqueror — led an army from France that invaded England, killed its king, Harold, with an arrow to the eye, and installed William on his throne. The tapestry is often called the world's first war propaganda, embroidered in wool on linen.

It's believed to have been sewn in England a few years after the battle, and soon taken to France — where it's currently displayed in a museum in the medieval town of Bayeux, Normandy. England has had to make do with only a 19th century replica, in one of its own museums.

But when the Bayeux museum closes this September, for two years of renovations, its famous tapestry will be packed up and sent on temporary loan to the United Kingdom — where it will go on display in London's British Museum starting in Sept. 2026.

Tapestry loan took longer to organize than Brexit

French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced the deal this week during a three-day U.K. state visit by Macron that was full of pomp and pageantry, including a horse-drawn carriage ride with King Charles III.

Macron and Starmer also agreed to increase support for Ukraine's defense, and announced a ""one in, one out"" deal to tackle illegal migration across their water border in the English Channel. Under that deal, within weeks the U.K. would return some undocumented migrants across the Channel to France, in return for an equal number of asylum seekers who've filed applications and have been waiting there.

In a speech Tuesday to the U.K. Parliament, Macron noted that in 2027, William the Conqueror would have celebrated his 1,000th birthday.

""I have to say, it took probably more years to deliver this project than all the Brexit texts,"" the French president joked to Parliament, referring to Britain's 2016 vote and 2020 exit from the European Union.

Speaking Wednesday alongside Macron at the British Museum, Starmer noted the year 1066 is iconic in England — even though it marked a historic battlefield loss to French troops.

""The Battle of Hastings, illustrated by the remarkable Bayeux Tapestry, was the beginning of 1,000 years of shared culture that is now defined by mutual admiration and kinship,"" the prime minister said.

The British Museum has many other artifacts other countries want back

In exchange for the tapestry, the British Museum says it will send on loan to museums in Normandy several ""treasures"" that represent the four nations of the U.K. — England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. They include Byzantine artifacts unearthed at the Sutton Hoo ship burial site in eastern England, and 12th century chess pieces carved from walrus ivory and discovered buried in a sand dune on Scotland's Isle of Lewis.

Museum experts say the exchange is part of a bigger trend of museums giving things back. The British Museum has many artifacts in its collection which were plundered during imperial and colonial eras, and are contested. It even publishes a list on its website.

""There's a lot of talk about slippery slopes and museums emptying,"" says Sarah Baxter, who serves on the advisory board of the Parthenon Project, lobbying the British Museum to return to the so-called Elgin Marbles to Greece, where they were plundered from the Parthenon. ""But I think what the Bayeux Tapestry coming to Britain does show though is the power of a partnership as the diplomatic solution.""",NewsAPI,-4.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/npr-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,43.09,"NPR, National Public Radio, npr.org  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/npr/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/npr-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-2.8),HIGH (0.9),USA,,Radio Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,"National Public Radio, Inc.",1971,-1.88,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,npr.org,,npr,19,USA,,,,

825,165,"After firing chaplains for speaking out, Ohio hospital CEO warns others to keep quiet • Ohio Capital Journal",https://ohiocapitaljournal.com/2025/07/29/after-firing-chaplains-for-speaking-out-ohio-hospital-ceo-warns-others-to-keep-quiet/,2025-07-29T08:55:17Z,Ohiocapitaljournal.com,US,asylum,"In the middle of a national firestorm, the top executive of a venerable Ohio hospital last Thursday told employees that “misinformation and lack of context can spread quickly, making it easy to jump to conclusions without all the facts.”

However, Cincinnati Children’s Hospital President and CEO Steve Davis didn’t provide any facts about the firings of two chaplains who spoke out in support of a former colleague whom the Trump administration is trying to deport.

Instead, he urged employees “to trust that our leaders and your colleagues are making decisions with the best interests of our patients, families and each other in mind,” according to a note to the staff obtained by the Capital Journal.

Children’s Hospital’s public affairs office was sent a copy of the note, which was posted late Thursday afternoon, but it didn’t respond to questions about it.

In addition to telling employees to trust him, Davis, the $2.5 million-a-year CEO, reminded his underlings of hospital policies regarding advocacy and media relations, according to the note.

Davis was addressing the controversy around Ayman Soliman, a man who served as a Muslim chaplain at Children’s after fleeing his native Egypt in 2014 and receiving asylum in the United States in 2018.

Soliman was arrested, beaten, and tortured in Egypt because of his work as a journalist during the Arab Spring.

Soliman’s asylum was revoked on June 3 and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement arrested him on July 9. He’s been in the Butler County Jail ever since. A federal judge issued an order preventing ICE from removing Soliman from Ohio at least through July 30.

Soliman’s lawyers say the administration has used a bogus, shifting set of claims to try to deport Soliman. Many have rallied to his support.

On July 17, there was a vigil for Soliman in Cincinnati. About 100 protesters left it to march in the travel lanes across the John A. Roebling Bridge to Covington, Ky., impeding traffic. Covington police arrested 15 — in some cases acting violently even though the protesters appeared to be peaceful.

Among those arrested were a reporter and photographer for CityBeat. Felony charges against them were later dropped, but misdemeanors remain pending.

In the aftermath, Cincinnati Children’s fired Adam Allen, one of its chaplains, merely for attending the vigil, Allen told WCPO TV. He said he tried to comply with what he thought was hospital policy.

“There was an HR meeting with our department to discuss media policies,” Allen told the station. “I understood from that meeting that I shouldn’t be a speaker. I could be misrepresented in the media as being a representative of the hospital. So I wore a shirt to the event that said, ‘I do not represent Cincinnati Children’s Hospital.'”

The hospital also fired chaplain Lizzy Diop, who had given media interviews in support of Soliman.

Children with serious medical conditions — both chronic and acute — have long been treated at Children’s. And chaplains have played an important role comforting traumatized kids and their parents, a story published Wednesday in Rolling Stone said.

Soliman was valuable to the hospital because of his generous demeanor, his ability to speak Arabic, and his training in Muslim theology, the story said.

Despite the seeming importance of chaplains to hospital care, Children’s is down three in a short span. The losses are all due to the same controversy — which stems from the priority President Donald Trump has placed on mass deportations.

In his note to the staff, Davis, the Children’s CEO, didn’t directly mention that controversy.

“As our country continues to experience changes and challenges, Cincinnati Children’s is not immune to the scrutiny that arises when polarizing topics and events occur,” the note said. “In fact, our reputation as a national leader in pediatric health brings a high level of attention and assumed expectations from our supporters, colleagues and the general public.”

Davis added, “Please know the absence of a public response should not be mistaken for a lack of caring or action.”

Children’s didn’t respond when asked whether the hospital feared retaliation from the Trump administration if employees speak out against Trump’s actions. Trump has engaged in high-profile battles in which he tried to defund elite universities over issues relating to free speech.

In the note to employees, Davis referenced rules from the hospital for employees about their own speech.

“While there may be divisiveness outside of our walls, we expect all employees to live our values and follow our policies, every day and in every interaction,” he wrote. “I encourage you to review our Code of Conduct, as well as policies related to Advocacy, Media Relations, Social Media and Solicitation.”",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,"ohio capital journal, ohiocapitaljournal.com, Ohio Capital-Journal",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/ohio-capital-journal-bias/,https://ground.news/interest/ohio-capital-journal,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/ohio-capital-journal-media-bias,LEFT,MOSTLY FACTUAL,USA,,Organization/Foundation,Minimal Traffic,MEDIUM CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,,,-2,Lean Left,Very High,Lean Left,Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,ohiocapitaljournal.com,ohiocapitaljournal.com,ohiocapitaljournal.com,103,USA,,,,

He was 89.

Mahler died on Sunday at a hospital in Berlin, Jan Dollwetzel, who represented Mahler at a trial in 2023, told German news agency dpa.

Mahler, born on Jan. 23, 1936, became a lawyer and in 1969 defended militants Andreas Baader and Gudrun Ensslin in a trial. Shortly afterward, he went on to found the Red Army Faction with them.

The group, which emerged from German student protests against the Vietnam War, killed 34 people and injured hundreds of others in a violent campaign against what members considered U.S. imperialism and capitalist oppression of workers. It declared itself disbanded in 1998.

In 1970, Mahler was arrested and sentenced to 14 years in prison over various bank robberies with a far-left motivation. He distanced himself from his extremist past while in custody and was released after 10 years. In 1987, he was readmitted to practice as a lawyer with the help of his then-defense attorney, Gerhard Schröder, who would later become German chancellor.

In the 1990s, Mahler switched to the opposite political extreme, becoming a member of the far-right National Democratic Party for a few years. He represented the party in 2001 in its case against an unsuccessful attempt by authorities to ban it.

Mahler racked up several convictions for denying the Holocaust, which earned him sentences totaling 10 years, and while in prison wrote a 200-page antisemitic screed that was put on the internet by unknown culprits.

In 2017, he fled to Hungary after being ordered to return to prison following a break from serving his sentence due to serious illness. Mahler said after he was arrested that he had requested asylum, but his claim was not confirmed by authorities. He was extradited to Germany and returned to prison.

Mahler was released in October 2020 and lived in Kleinmachnow, just outside Berlin.

Germany’s interior minister has hosted five of his European counterparts to discuss ways of tightening the region’s asylum rules, as his country deported 81 Afghans to their Taliban-controlled homeland.

The European Union’s immigration system needed to be “tougher and stricter”, Minister Alexander Dobrindt said after Friday’s meeting in southern Germany with the interior ministers of France, Poland, Austria, the Czech Republic and Denmark, as well as EU Migration Commissioner Magnus Brunner.

The cohort issued a five-page communique on their aims, which included the establishment of “return hubs” for holding people outside the EU, enabling asylum procedures in third countries, and allowing deportations to Afghanistan and Syria as standard practice.

All measures would require approval from Brussels.

“When we analyse what has been agreed here, it’s lofty ambitions, but not much detail about how they intend to pursue what’s in these five pages,” said Al Jazeera’s Dominic Kane, reporting from Berlin.

Ministers, he said, had talked about “the sorts of things that they agree on, but they know they can’t implement them themselves as unilateral decisions.”

Speaking after the meeting, Dobrindt said, “We wanted to send a signal that Germany is no longer sitting in the brakeman’s cab on migration issues in Europe, but is in the locomotive.”

Afghans deported

Hours before the meeting, Germany demonstrated just how serious it was about cracking down on migration by sending 81 Afghan nationals back to their homeland, prompting an outcry from rights organisations.

Amnesty International criticised the deportations, saying the situation in Afghanistan was “catastrophic” and that “extrajudicial executions, enforced disappearances and torture are commonplace”.

Europe’s top economy had stopped deportations to Afghanistan and closed its embassy in Kabul following the Taliban movement’s return to power in 2021.

But Berlin resumed expulsions last year when the previous government of Olaf Scholz expelled 28 convicted Afghans.

Current Chancellor Friedrich Merz defended the expulsions of the 81 Afghan men, saying he was “grateful” to be able to deliver on promises made when entering government in May.

None of those deported “had a residence status any more. All asylum applications were legally rejected without further legal recourse”, he said at a news conference.

Bavaria state’s Interior Minister Joachim Herrmann said 15 of the deported Afghans had been incarcerated for crimes, including murder and manslaughter, sexual offences and property crimes.

The state of Baden-Wuerttemberg said 13 Afghans deported from there had been jailed for crimes including homicide, bodily harm, drug offences and serious arson.

In the wake of the announcement, the United Nations said no one should be sent back to Afghanistan, whatever their status.

Watch: Shops selling illegal tobacco on a Newport high street make locals feel unsafe

Along a one-mile stretch of road near the centre of Newport, 19 shops have been shut down in the past nine months for selling illegal tobacco and vapes. ""It's shameful that this is happening,"" says Steve Hay, one of the Trading Standards team responsible for the closures. He says the sale of illegal goods is a crime causing deep problems in the community. In South Wales, the BBC was told of criminal gangs using forced labour, mini-marts staffed with illegal workers and cars filled with drugs and fake cigarettes. It is just a glimpse of what one Trading Standards officer describes as an ""endless battle"" against the illegal tobacco and vape trade in Britain. People living and working near shops like these have told the BBC they are terrified by the criminality surrounding them, with reports of intimidation, open drug dealing and an acid attack. Illegal cigarettes, tobacco and vape products were seized from 3,624 shops across England, Scotland and Wales in 2024-25, according to BBC Freedom of Information (FOI) requests. Responses were gathered from 169 local Trading Standards teams, out of an estimated total of 187. Many of the seizures came from convenience stores and vape shops, but illegal goods were also found in several other high street shops, including takeaways, beauty salons and even a carpet repair shop. The trade ""undermines legitimate retailers, funds wider crime, and harms public health"" according to HM Revenue and Customs, and deprived public services of nearly £72m in 2023-24. What's more, local authorities have limited powers to tackle the problem.

In Newport, some of the closed shops still have the shutters down, but others appear to be back in business. Young men sit outside them, smoking and chatting in the sunshine. Watching it all with frustration is Erol Kaya, who runs his own legitimate international supermarket on the same road. A Turkish-born Kurd, he has lived in South Wales for 26 years and says he now witnesses the brazen sale of illegal goods every day. ""I'm not happy,"" he says, his voice rising with emotion. ""I'm paying tax, my staff paying tax, and people [are] making illegal money."" He adds that customers have told him they are now scared to visit the road, especially after dark. Only some councils have the power to shut these establishments down, and even then, only usually for three months. Fewer than 300 shops were shut down in this way in the past year, according to our FOI requests.

Shop owner Erol Kaya says he witnesses the selling of illegal goods every day

'Elusive owners'

Behind the bright crisp packets and fizzy drink bottles lining the shelves of an east London convenience store, there is not a lot of stock. ""I think this is our fourth visit,"" says Nazir Ali, from Barking and Dagenham Trading Standards. The owners of this business, he says, are elusive, which makes it difficult to close the shop. ""Every time we've been here, we've found concealments.""

Trading Standards officers Nazir Ali and Samantha Veira with a stash of confiscated goods

Out back, it looks almost empty – until a sniffer dog finds stacks of illegal cigarettes and tobacco inside a makeshift wall. Ali estimates they are worth more than £5,000. He says that is enough to temporarily close the shop. But under current legislation, he still has to prove antisocial or nuisance behaviour. Illegal goods were seized from 245 shops in the borough in 2024-25, the highest number in Britain of the councils that responded to BBC requests. But FOI figures show that, like many councils, Barking and Dagenham didn't report any shop closures between April 2024 and 2025. A spokesperson says the council continues to work with businesses where appropriate, considering the full range of enforcement tools available including closure orders.

'Stash cars'

In Newport, by contrast, the Trading Standards team has temporarily shut down all but one of the 28 shops it seized from in 2024-25. However, closing shops does not necessarily make the problem go away. Criminals will either wait for a shop to re-open or simply move to a vacant site nearby. Often, the illegal stock is stored in ""stash cars"" parked near the closed shop. ""It's not good enough, it's appalling and I'm desperately sad it's happening,"" Steve Hay tells us. ""You can't stop crime as a whole, but it should not be so visible and accessible.""

Trading Standards officer Steve Hay breaks the window of a suspected 'stash car'

On raids 40 miles away in Swansea, Trading Standards officers say the stash cars may contain drugs as well as counterfeit cigarettes. Rhys Harries, an officer there told us: ""It's tobacco in the day, drugs in the night."" He tells us trying to enforce the law can be perilous: ""I've had officers that have been threatened. My car windows have been smashed in the past. It is a serious crime and we're dealing with serious criminals.""

There are also issues with immigration crime and illegal working. On a raid with Swansea Trading Standards, immigration officers arrested an asylum seeker - an Iraqi Kurd without right to work in the UK. They suspected he was in control of a tobacco stash car.

'I don't feel safe'

The BBC spoke to three shop workers in South Wales, all too scared to be identified. One described seeing acid thrown during an argument between mini-market staff. Another woman, who has worked in a shop for more than 30 years, says she sees drug dealing every morning. ""There's no control. It doesn't feel like home now,"" she says. One man we spoke to - Daniel – says he is repeatedly seeing high street raids and criminality. ""It doesn't make me feel safe. I've got kids,"" he says. He has dual UK-Chinese nationality and has lived in Swansea for much of his life. Now he says he is thinking about moving his family back to Hong Kong.

Swansea has become a hub for counterfeit rolling tobacco, says Harries. He says the trade is controlled by Chinese gangs in the city who are making ""phenomenal"" amounts of cash this way. Chinese migrants, brought in on student visas, are forced to work illegally and stuff hundreds of pouches of tobacco every week, he says. ""The amount of money [the gangs] they can make selling tobacco is greater than if they were selling drugs,"" he explains. The counterfeit tobacco is supplied to predominantly Kurdish gangs, who then sell it under the counter in mini-marts, according to Harries.

'No good for the future'

Nazir Ali says he would like to see clearer legislation and more resources to support Trading Standards in taking action against shops selling illegal goods. Some local authorities have powers to apply to magistrates' courts for closure orders under antisocial legislation. But these can only be issued if it can be proved that a premises is a serious nuisance to the public or disorderly, offensive or criminal behaviour is likely to occur. On the limited occasions when councils report shops closing permanently, this is generally through Trading Standards working with landlords who evicted tenants. Tougher rules introduced in 2023 mean those convicted now can face higher fines of up to £10,000 - but this may still be lower than the value of the counterfeit cigarettes being sold. In a statement to the BBC, the Home Office says that ""over 500 town centres are getting extra neighbourhood patrols"" and that these would have a major role in cracking down on the sale of illegal tobacco products. It adds that ""Border Force is working to ensure [these products] don't make it to our shelves in the first place, seizing over 97 tonnes of illegal tobacco last year."" The chief executive of the anti-smoking charity Ash, Hazel Cheeseman, says that although the illicit tobacco market has declined over the last few decades, it remains a concern. She urges the government to pass legislation to toughen licensing rules for the sale of tobacco, and gradually phase it out altogether. Meanwhile, the situation in Newport is making Erol question the safety of raising his family in South Wales. ""I'm a foreigner… but this country is my kids' country, my grandkids,"" he says.

When it comes to falling in love, few in Hollywood can match Pamela Anderson.

Since the late 1980s, Anderson has been linked to hard rockers, surfers, and even Julian Assange.

Most recently, Anderson, 58, sparked dating rumors with her ""The Naked Gun"" costar Liam Neeson, 73. The two played coy about their offscreen relationship while appearing on ""Today"" to promote the movie, but according to People, the stars are in a ""budding romance.""

832,269,Sheinbaum demands return of Mexican citizens held at ‘Alligator Alcatraz’,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/sheinbaum-demands-return-mexican-citizens-182059324.html,2025-07-30T18:20:59Z,Yahoo Entertainment,US,asylum,"Mexico’s president, Claudia Sheinbaum, has said that the country is demanding the repatriation of at least 30 of its citizens currently being held in the controversial Florida immigration detention center known as “Alligator Alcatraz”.

The Mexican leader said on Wednesday that a note had been sent to US authorities “demanding that any Mexicans who might enter this detention center should be repatriated immediately”.

Sheinbaum added: “They have no reason to enter these detention centers. Within the framework of the United States’ own laws, what we seek is for them to return to our country immediately and not be detained in this manner.”

The 39-acre (16 hectares) camp erected about 40 miles (64km) from Miami has come under heavy criticism from non-profit organizations who say detainees are held in overcrowded pods, along with sewage backups “resulting in cages flooded with feces”, and, in some cases, have been denied medical care.

Related: Advocates demand closure of ‘Alligator Alcatraz’, citing appalling conditions

Yet, the Trump administration and local Florida officials have flaunted the facility’s brutality since it opened earlier this month, emphasizing its isolated location in a swamp infested with pythons, alligators and crocodiles.

Sheinbaum’s comments come after the Mexican consul in Miami, Rutilio Escandón, visited the Florida detention center this week, becoming the first overseas consul to do so.

“One of the complaints is that they bathe every three days, that they’re allowed to bathe every three days,” Escandón told the Telemundo TV station, referring to the 39 Mexicans he was able to interview. “Sometimes the air conditioning is very cold – they say sometimes it’s at 60 [degrees fahrenheit]. But it’s also very hot and there’s a lot of mosquitoes.”

On Sunday, Roberto Velasco Álvarez, head of the North American unit at the Mexican foreign ministry, announced that two young brothers who had been held at Alligator Alcatraz, one of whom was visiting the US on a tourist visa, had been repatriated to Mexico without charges.

The opening of the Alligator Alcatraz facility comes amid a nationwide crackdown by the Trump administration on migrants and asylum seekers, with agents from US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) sweeping up tens of thousands of people in raids across the country.

“The treatment of our fellow citizens there, particularly with these raids, is deeply painful,” Sheinbaum said. “We will always be there to support them.”

834,59,Simon Pegg Film 'Angels In The Asylum' Owes Creditors $5M (Exclusive),http://deadline.com/2025/07/simon-pegg-angels-in-the-asylum-owes-creditors-5-million-1236459049/,2025-07-16T09:05:04Z,Deadline,US,asylum,"EXCLUSIVE: Angels in the Asylum, the British indie film starring Simon Pegg and Katherine Waterston, has left creditors out of pocket to the tune of £3.7M ($5M) after halting filming six months ago, according to a financial filing.

As revealed by Deadline earlier this year, Angels in the Asylum was mounted without its financing fully in place and had to shut down in February, 15 days into a month-long shoot. The picture is housed at special purpose vehicle AITA Films Limited, with first-time feature director Rob Sorrenti serving as producer alongside Heather Greenwood, who co-produced Gavin & Stacey: The Finale.

AITA Films Limited filed for administration in April, a process equivalent to Chapter 11 bankruptcy in the U.S. Kallis Insolvency Practitioners, AITA Films’ administrator, has now produced a report outlining the company’s affairs and the amount owed to financiers, cast, crew, and suppliers.

Watch on Deadline

Sorrenti and Greenwood have been approached for comment. They have previously apologized to angry crew, adding: “It was never what we could possibly have imagined when we started this journey.” Pegg is an executive producer on Angels in the Asylum, though he was not involved in the film’s finances and has not been paid for his work to date. The Crown director Steven Daldry is also an executive producer.

Among the major creditors are Brandhouse Global Limited, which provided £486,966 in interim financing after “anticipated funding from Parkland Pictures did not materialise,” per the financial filing. Parkland CEO John Cairns has previously told Deadline that his company had no agreement to finance Angels in the Asylum beyond its work as a sales agent.

Cast members are owed at least £374,649, while “trade and expense” creditors are out of pocket by £1.39M, which likely includes studio spaces, including Versa and Twickenham Film Studios. Deadline has previously reported that crew members are owed at least £600,000 in wages.

The administrator’s report provided an upbeat update on the film securing financing to pay creditors and resume production. “Discussions with proposed funders is progressing well and an in-depth due diligence process is currently being undertaken by the funders and their lawyers,” the report said. The film’s set is in storage until September while the conversations continue.

Should financing be secured, “all creditors will be paid in full,” the report added. Should the funding discussions break down, only “preferential” creditors will receive what they are owed. These preferential creditors include £41,242 in employee arrears and holiday, as well as HM Revenue & Customs.

Inspired by true events, Angels in the Asylum co-stars Minnie Driver, Lesley Nicol, Rose Williams, Aurora Perrineau, and Alex Jennings. It centers on women who were forcibly confined in isolation at Surrey’s Long Grove Asylum in the 1930s after being deemed to be typhoid carriers.

Bectu and Equity have supported members impacted by the hiatus. In a statement to Deadline, Bectu boss Philippa Childs said: “Film and TV workers have already faced an incredibly challenging few years and to be out of pocket will make things even difficult financially for lots of our members who’ve lent their talents and expertise to this film. While this situation is unfortunately symptomatic of a very unstable industry, it is the crew who are too often the first to suffer and the hardest hit when production is impacted.”",NewsAPI,-4.97,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/deadline-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.35,"Deadline, deadline.com",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/deadline-hollywood/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/deadline-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER,HIGH,USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,,,,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,deadline.com,,deadline,13,USA,,,,

Vanessa Frake, a former prison governor, said it would be “relatively easy” to convert some of the nation’s existing high-security facilities.

She made the comments as she announced she had formally joined Reform to play a leading role in the party’s law and order task force.

Nigel Farage said he wanted there to be debate on moving to a “supermax” prisons system after he was asked about the potential cost of making such a change.

He told a press conference in Westminster: “The supermax prisons, have we costed it? Have we thought it through? It is a debate.

“The point about this task force is we are starting a debate and we would rather like it to become a full public debate too.”

Ms Frake added: “I didn’t say we should build supermax prisons. I actually said a super max regime. There is a totally different thing and converting part of our high-security estate into a supermax wing would be relatively easy.”

US “supermax” prisons hold prisoners who are deemed to be such a high risk that they cannot be housed even in maximum security facilities.

Such facilities see inmates confined in single cells with facilities made of poured, reinforced concrete to deter self-harm. They are under 24-hour supervision, carried out with high staff–inmate ratios.

The Labour Government has been examining the issue, with Shabana Mahmood, the Justice Secretary, having ordered a review into potential ways of segregating dangerous offenders.

Tories: ‘Reform are doodling fantasy prisons on the back of a pub napkin’

The Tories accused Nigel Farage of making “wild promises” on tackling crime he cannot deliver on.

Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, said: “Reform are doodling fantasy prisons on the back of a pub napkin.

“Once again Nigel Farage has made wild promises to the British public but completely failed to set out how he intends to pay for any of them. Empty words, zero plan, and not a shred of credibility.

“Only the Conservatives, under new leadership, believe in sound money, zero tolerance on crime, and serious leadership. Britain deserves better than this façade.”

Labour hits back at Farage after Reform leader’s crime press conference

Labour said it was “taking the tough action needed” to tackle crime while Nigel Farage “shouts from the sidelines”.

A Labour Party spokesperson, said: “Nigel Farage offers anger, but no answers.

“It’s farcical that Farage can’t say what his policies are, how much they would cost, or how they would even work. Reform aren’t serious and don’t have a clue as to how they would address the challenges facing working people.

“If Reform really wanted to crack down on crime, their MPs should have backed Labour’s tough new laws to introduce stronger sentences for grooming offenders, mandatory reporting of child sexual abuse, and stricter penalties for antisocial behaviour. While Farage shouts from the sidelines, Labour is taking the tough action needed to make our streets safer.”

Farage: Police should release immigration status of people charged with crime

Nigel Farage said police forces should release the name, address and immigration status of people after they are charged with a crime.

He told a press conference: “I absolutely think that they should and I think particularly given there is a pretty febrile atmosphere around these areas, particularly sexual assaults and rapes where the temperature of this debate has risen significantly, yes I do believe they should.”

He made the comments after Warwickshire Police was accused of “covering up” an alleged rape of a 12-year-old girl by Afghan asylum seekers.

Ahmad Mulakhil, 23, was charged last week with the rape of the girl in Nuneaton, while Mohammad Kabir, 23, was charged with kidnap and strangulation.

Warwickshire Police reportedly advised local councillors and officials not to reveal the asylum-seeker background of the two suspects, for fear of “inflaming community tensions”.

Warwickshire Police has not denied reports that Mr Mulakhil and Mr Kabir are asylum seekers.

The pair have appeared at Coventry magistrates’ court and were both remanded in custody until an appearance at Warwick Crown Court on Aug 26.

In a statement, the force said that once someone is charged with an offence, they follow national guidance, which “does not include sharing ethnicity or immigration status”.

Labour ‘sinking to gutter politics’ with Jimmy Savile claim, says Farage

Nigel Farage accused Labour of “sinking to the gutter of politics” after Government ministers claimed the Reform leader was “on the side” of child predators and extreme pornographers because of his opposition to the Online Safety Act.

Peter Kyle, the Science Secretary, said last week: “Make no mistake about it, if people like Jimmy Savile were alive today, he would be perpetrating his crimes online, and Nigel Farage is saying that he is on their side, not the side of children.”

Jess Phillips, a Home Office minister, doubled down on the claim.

Mr Farage said this morning: “It is just sinking to the gutter of politics to make that comparison.

“I repeat the point we would love to see effective legislation that protected young children from harmful and dangerous material. This Act does not do that and this Act then extends right into the area of free speech.”

He added: “The effects, I would say, are chilling already.”

Online Safety Act is ‘beginning of state censorship’, says Farage

Nigel Farage is now taking questions from the press.

The Reform UK leader said the “original intention” of the Act was “honourable” in terms of trying to keep children safer online.

Vanessa Frake, a former prison governor who is now Reform’s justice adviser, is now addressing this morning’s press conference.

Ms Frake said she had never been a member of any other political party and was not a traditional politician having done a “proper job” for decades.

Analysis: Farage taking advantage of Westminster’s summer break

This is the third week of Reform’s crime campaign, which has involved a series of defections from local crime and justice figures and some tough policy announcements.



This strategy from Nigel Farage is designed to take advantage of this summer’s Parliamentary recess, when the Government is unable to make major policy announcements and the news agenda dries up.



The latest defection, from the Leicestershire police and crime commissioner Rupert Matthews, is about crime on the streets and the failure of authorities to keep offenders in jail.



Mr Matthew’s punchy speech included the line that some towns and cities in England and Wales had become an “apocalyptic wasteland of lawless Britain”.

In the early days of President Donald Trump’s second term, I spent a few weeks observing Chicago’s immigration court to get a sense of how things were changing. One afternoon in March, the case of a 27-year-old Venezuelan asylum-seeker caught my attention.

Albert Jesús Rodríguez Parra stared into the camera at his virtual bond hearing. He wore the orange shirt given to inmates at a jail in Laredo, Texas, and headphones to listen to the proceedings through an interpreter.

More than a year earlier, Rodríguez had been convicted of shoplifting in the Chicago suburbs. But since then he had seemed to get his life on track. He found a job at Wrigley Field, sent money home to his mom in Venezuela and went to the gym and church with his girlfriend. Then, in November, federal authorities detained him at his apartment on Chicago’s South Side and accused him of belonging to the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua.

“Are any of your tattoos gang related?” his attorney asked at the hearing, going through the evidence laid out against him in an Immigration and Customs Enforcement report. “No,” said Rodríguez, whose tattoos include an angel holding a gun, a wolf and a rose. At one point, he lifted his shirt to show his parents’ names inked across his chest.

He was asked about a TikTok video that shows him dancing to an audio clip of someone shouting, “Te va agarrar el Tren de Aragua,” which means, “The Tren de Aragua is going to get you,” followed by a dance beat. That audio clip has been shared some 60,000 times on TikTok — it’s popular among Venezuelans ridiculing the stereotype that everyone from their country is a gangster. Rodríguez looked incredulous at the thought that this was the evidence against him.

That day, the judge didn’t address the gang allegations. But she denied Rodríguez bond, citing the misdemeanor shoplifting conviction. She reminded him that his final hearing was on March 20, just 10 days away. If she granted him asylum, he’d be a free man and could continue his life in the U.S.

I told my editors and colleagues about what I’d heard and made plans to attend the next hearing. I saw the potential for the kind of complicated narrative story that I like: Here was a young immigrant who, yes, had come into the country illegally, but he had turned himself in to border authorities to seek asylum. Yes, he had a criminal record, but it was for a nonviolent offense. And, yes, he had tattoos, but so do the nice, white American moms in my book club. I was certain there are members of Tren de Aragua in the U.S., but if this was the kind of evidence the government had, I found it hard to believe it was an “invasion” as Trump claimed. I asked Rodríguez’s attorney for an interview and began requesting police and court records.

Five days later, on March 15, the Trump administration expelled more than 230 Venezuelan men to a maximum security prison in El Salvador, a country many of them had never even set foot in. Trump called them all terrorists and gang members. It would be a few days before the men’s names would be made public. Perhaps naively, it didn’t occur to me that Rodríguez might be in that group. Then I logged into his final hearing and heard his attorney say he didn’t know where the government had taken him. The lawyer sounded tired and defeated. Later, he would tell me he had barely slept, afraid that Rodríguez might turn up dead. At the hearing, he begged a government lawyer for information: “For his family’s sake, would you happen to know what country he was sent to?” She told him she didn’t know, either.

I was astonished. I am familiar with the history of authoritarian leaders disappearing people they don’t like in Latin America, the part of the world that my family comes from. I wanted to think that doesn’t happen in this country. But what I had just witnessed felt uncomfortably similar.

As soon as the hearing ended, I got on a call with my colleagues Mica Rosenberg and Perla Trevizo, both of whom cover immigration and had recently written about how the U.S. government had sent other Venezuelan men to Guantanamo. We talked about what we should do with what I’d just heard. Mica contacted a source in the federal government who confirmed, almost immediately, that Rodríguez was among the men that our country had sent to El Salvador.

The news suddenly felt more real and intimate to me. One of the men sent to a brutal prison in El Salvador now had a name and a face and a story that I had heard from his own mouth. I couldn’t stop thinking about him.

As a news organization, we decided to put significant resources into investigating who these men really are and what happened to them, bringing in many talented ProPublica journalists to help pull records, sift through social media accounts, analyze court data and find the men’s families. We teamed up with a group of Venezuelan journalists from the outlets Alianza Rebelde Investiga and Cazadores de Fake News who were also starting to track down information about the men.

We spoke to the relatives and attorneys of more than 100 of the men and obtained internal government records that undercut the Trump administration’s claims that all the men are “monsters,” “sick criminals” and the “worst of the worst.” We also published a story about how, by and large, the men were not hiding from federal immigration authorities. They were in the system; many had open asylum cases like Rodríguez and were waiting for their day in court before they were taken away and imprisoned in Central America.

On July 18 — after I’d written the first draft of this note to you — we began to hear some chatter about a potential prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Venezuela. Later that same day, the men had been released. We’d been in the middle of working on a case-by-case accounting of the Venezuelan men who’d been held in El Salvador. Though they’d been released, documenting who they are and how they got caught up in this dragnet was still important, essential even, as was the impact of their incarceration.

The result is a database we published last week including profiles of 238 of the men Trump deported to a Salvadoran prison.

From the moment I heard about the men’s return to Venezuela, I thought about Rodríguez. He’d been on my mind since embarking on this project. I messaged with his mother for days as we waited for the men to be processed by the government of Nicolás Maduro and released to their families.

Finally, one morning last week, he went home. We spoke later that afternoon. He said he was relieved to be home with his family but felt traumatized. He told me he wants the world to know what happened to him in the Salvadoran prison — daily beatings, humiliation, psychological abuse. “There is no reason for what I went through,” he said. “I didn’t deserve that.”

The Salvadoran government has denied mistreating the Venezuelan prisoners.

We asked the Trump administration about its evidence against Rodríguez. This is the entirety of its statement: “Albert Jesús Rodriguez Parra is an illegal alien from Venezuela and Tren de Aragua gang member. He illegally crossed the border on April 22, 2023, under the Biden Administration.”

While Rodríguez was incarcerated in El Salvador and no one knew what would happen to him, the court kept delaying hearings for his asylum case. But after months of continuances, on Monday, Rodríguez logged into a virtual hearing from Venezuela. “Oh my gosh, I am so happy to see that,” said Judge Samia Naseem, clearly remembering what had happened in his case.

Rodríguez’s attorney said that his client had been tortured and abused in El Salvador. “I can’t even describe to this court what he went through,” he said. “He’s getting psychological help, and that’s my priority.”

It was a brief hearing, perhaps five minutes. Rodríguez’s lawyer mentioned his involvement in an ongoing lawsuit against the Trump administration over its use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans. The government lawyer said little, except to question whether Rodríguez was even allowed to appear virtually due to “security issues” in Venezuela.

Finally, the judge said she would administratively close the case while the litigation plays out. “If he should hopefully be able to come back to the U.S., we’ll calendar the case,” she said.

Naseem turned to Rodríguez, who was muted and looked serious. “You don’t have to worry about reappearing until this gets sorted out,” she told him. He nodded and soon logged off.

We plan to keep reporting on what happened and have another story coming soon about Rodríguez and the other men’s experiences inside the prison. Please reach out if you have information to share.

839,203,Lego just dropped 9 new sets at Comic-Con 2025 — including a stunning brick-built Game Boy I checked out,https://www.techradar.com/streaming/entertainment/lego-just-dropped-9-new-sets-at-comic-con-2025-including-a-stunning-brick-built-game-boy-i-checked-out,2025-07-24T00:30:07Z,TechRadar,US,asylum,"Lego’s recreated some iconic pieces of tech over the years in brick-built form, but this surprise debut at San Diego Comic Con might just take the cake. You might have heard rumblings, but the Lego Game Boy is real, and I’ve held it.

It’s nearly a 1:1 replica of the iconic gaming handheld that you’ll assemble out of 421 pieces. You’ll not just build the console, though, as you’ll also build Game Paks for two legendary titles: The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening and Super Mario Land. While these aren’t exactly playable, you can swap out the ‘screen’ for the console's loading system or moments from the games.

The best news here, beyond the rest of the details which I’ll get too, might just be the price. While this is a collaboration with Nintendo, Lego’s kept the price on the more affordable side at $59.99 / £54.99 / AU$99.99 – yes, a lot for an only slightly above 400-piece set, but it’s a unique collaboration.

The Lego Game Boy goes up for preorder right now and will start shipping on October 1, 2025. I suspect this will be a highly popular gift as we enter the holiday season, and it’s for the attention to detail that Lego has done here. As a 1:1 replica, you’ll build dial controls for contrast and volume as well as all the main buttons: SELECT, START, +Control Pad, A, and B Buttons.

The Lego Game Boy was unveiled at San Diego Comic-Con 2025 alongside the Lego Batman Arkham Asylum – which you can see TechRadar’s reveal of here – inside a booth that contained a shrunk-down, but still quite large, made-out-of-Lego replica of the convention center.

You can see a gallery of that below, plus a look at the eight other sets that premiered at the show. Those include Stranger Things BrickHeadz and several new sets themed to Wicked, ahead of Wicked for Good arriving later in 2025.

842,8,Experts say Israel’s West Bank demolitions aim to drive Palestinians away,https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/8/3/experts-say-israels-west-bank-demolitions-aim-to-drive-palestinians-away,2025-08-03T14:58:37Z,Al Jazeera English,US,refugee,"Israel is carrying out more demolitions this year than in any other year of the occupation, which began in 1967.

On June 25, Mutawakil al-Mohamad and his family woke up to the sound of Israeli soldiers pounding on their door with their rifles.

It would be the last time they woke up in their family home in occupied East Jerusalem.

The Israeli forces arrived at 7am in military convoys with two heavy bulldozers, and al-Mohamad was terrified the soldiers would raid his house and arrest him or his loved ones.

Instead, the soldiers told the family their home was in a designated “military zone” and ordered them to vacate immediately so they could bulldoze it to the ground.

“When I opened the door, I told the soldiers: ‘My young children are scared.’ I asked them to give me 10 minutes, then we will all be out of the house,” al-Mohamed said. The soldiers obliged, he recalled from Ramallah, the administrative capital of the occupied West Bank, where he now lives.

Demolitions and displacement

Israel is demolishing more Palestinian homes across the occupied West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, at a higher rate in 2025 than any previous year since the occupation began in 1967.

Israeli authorities have already destroyed 783 structures – a figure that does not include the large-scale destruction in refugee camps – leading to the forced displacement of 1,119 people, according to the United Nations.

In the Palestinian refugee camps, Israel has destroyed about 600 structures in the Jenin camp and a combined 300 structures in the Tulkarem and Nur Shams camps as part of military raids it launched at the start of this year, according to figures that Al Jazeera obtained from the Palestinian human rights organisation Al-Haq.

Human rights groups, civilians and analysts said the real aim of Israel’s tactics – systematic home demolitions and forced displacement – is to make life unbearable for Palestinians so more will consider leaving if they can.

“Israel’s goal in the West Bank is the same as its goal in Gaza. … It wants to target all Palestinians,” said Murad Jadallah, a human rights researcher with Al-Haq.

Jadallah argued that Israel’s war in Gaza, which many experts have called a genocide, has shocked the world and distracted many from its unprecedented destruction in the West Bank.

“Israel is benefiting from the images of destruction it has created in Gaza in order to push its agenda in the West Bank,” he told Al Jazeera.

Little support

Since the start of this year, about 40,000 Palestinians have fled Israeli military operations in West Bank refugee camps.

Many have struggled to find affordable replacement accommodations, renting instead in whatever villages where they find room, staying with relatives in overcrowded homes or languishing in public buildings converted into shelters for displaced people, Jadallah said.

Ahmed Gaeem, 60, recalled Israeli soldiers evicting him, his wife, five children, grandchildren, siblings, nieces and nephews from their building in the Tulkarem refugee camp in March.

The family was also told by Israeli soldiers that Tulkarem had been designated a “military zone” and they would not be allowed to return for some time.

“We left with the clothes on our backs and nothing else. We didn’t have time to pack anything,” Gaeem told Al Jazeera.

A few weeks into Israel’s military campaign, one of Gaeem’s sons managed to return briefly to assess the damage to their home from a distance.

Their home – like countless others – was destroyed. Its windows were shattered, the door hinges blown off and walls caved in.

Gaeem’s family is currently renting three homes in Iktaba village, a few kilometres from Tulkarem city, for a combined rent of about $1,300 – a fortune for a family surviving on meagre savings.

Gaeem noted that while his salary as a Palestinian Authority (PA) civil servant is $500 a month, he hasn’t been paid in months because of the PA’s ongoing economic crisis.

Over the past several years, the PA has cut salaries and struggled to pay its staff as a result of dwindling donor support and Israel’s refusal to hand over tax revenue it collects on the PA’s behalf, an arrangement laid out in the Oslo Accords.

The PA itself was born out of the Oslo peace agreements of 1993 and 1995, which were signed by the Israeli and Palestinian leaders. The accords ostensibly aimed to bring about a Palestinian state in the years that followed.

Unprecedented crisis

The Oslo Accords split the West Bank into three zones.

The PA was tasked with overseeing security and executive functions in Area A and executive functions in Area B while Israel remained in total control of Area C.

This control allowed Israel to quietly and gradually expand illegal settlements – after encircling and then demolishing Palestinian homes and communities – in Area C, a largely agricultural region that makes up about 60 percent of the West Bank.

In July, the Israeli army issued two orders that gave it an additional legal pretext to demolish homes in Area B – a power previously held only by the PA under the Oslo Accords. The orders enabled Israel to assume control over building and planning laws and laws pertaining to agricultural sites.

Before these measures, most demolitions in Areas A and B were carried out during military operations or as reprisals against Palestinians who resisted the occupation. Israel now has an additional legal basis to destroy Palestinian homes by claiming the owners do not have building permits.

Israel systematically denies building permits to Palestinians as part of a broader policy of confiscating Palestinian homes and land, according to human rights groups.

Among the record number of demolitions carried out across the West Bank this year, the UN documented the destruction of 49 structures in Areas A and B.

Under international law, Israel is prohibited from destroying private property anywhere in occupied Palestinian territory and from establishing settlements or outposts.

“The extension of demolitions in Area A and B and the way Israel is changing the legal status in Area B are unprecedented,” said Tahani Mustafa, an expert on the West Bank with the International Crisis Group think tank.

She added that Israel appears to be trying to confine Palestinians to ever smaller pockets of land in Area A. Israel’s ultimate plan, she fears, is to make life increasingly unbearable for Palestinians in urban centres, likely by imposing more checkpoints and barriers to restrict movement and carrying out more raids

Israel’s intensifying assault on Palestinians across the West Bank already has people like al-Mohamed fearing that his family could be evicted again.

He said most Palestinians predict that Israel will turn its attention to the West Bank’s cities after it finishes its military raids in the nearby camps.

“It’s hard for us to go anywhere else other than the West Bank,” he told Al Jazeera.

843,143,Superman or 'Superwoke'? Right-wing critics of the new DC movie say the latter,https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/pop-culture-news/superman-movie-james-gunn-slammed-as-woke-rcna217653,2025-07-10T09:00:00Z,NBC News,US,refugee,"Superman arrived on Earth a refugee from a dying world, adopted by farmers in the American heartland. But as the Man of Steel lands in theaters with a new reboot this weekend, some conservative critics are taking issue with the superhero saga being framed as an immigrant's story.

The outrage, primarily from right-wing commentators, began percolating in the last week, before many had even seen the film. The criticism centers around recent comments made by director James Gunn, who underscored how Superman’s immigrant identity is weaved into the film’s storyline.

“I mean, Superman is the story of America,” Gunn told The Times of London newspaper in an interview published last week. “An immigrant that came from other places and populated the country. But for me it is mostly a story that says basic human kindness is a value and is something we have lost.”

Gunn has since repeated similar refrains during the film’s press tour, fueling sentiments from critics who say he has unnecessarily politicized the superhero.

Superhero comics have historically not shied away from political themes — Captain America, for example, famously punched Adolf Hitler on a 1941 comic cover, and Superman fought the Ku Klux Klan in a 1946 radio broadcast.

The new ""Superman"" film debuts Friday in theaters nationwide. Alon Amir / Warner Bros.

But the new “Superman” installment, which is being released by Warner Bros., has become the latest superhero film to become a political flashpoint for commentators who have long publicly blasted Hollywood for its perceived liberalism.

Earlier this year, some fans threatened to boycott “Captain America: Brave New World” over comments made by Anthony Mackie, the first Black man to play Captain America, about the superhero’s identity.

After Gunn’s recent comments, the popular X account “End Wokeness” stated in a post, “Hollywood literally never learns.” And in a Monday segment, Fox News labeled the movie “Superwoke.” The segment’s banner read: “Iconic hero movie to embrace pro-immigrant themes.”

“You know what it says on his cape? MS-13,” Fox News host Jessie Watters joked, referring to the international criminal gang that President Donald Trump’s administration claims it is targeting in its immigration raids.

Another Fox host, Greg Gutfeld, accused Gunn of trying to create a “moat of woke, enlightened opinion around him” after having been “canceled” and fired from Disney as a result of resurfaced tweets containing pedophilia jokes.

Fox News contributor Kellyanne Conway, a former Trump aide, similarly took issue with “Superman,” citing a recent CBS News' ""Sunday Morning"" interview with star David Corenswet in which the actor didn’t mention the word “American” when referring to Superman’s slogan of “truth, justice and the American way.”

“I can’t believe that we’ve come down to that,” Conway said. “We don’t go to the movie theater to be lectured to and to have somebody throw their ideology onto us,” she said on air, speculating whether the film would “be successful.”

Representatives for Corenswet did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new film, which also stars Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane and Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, has been certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes as early ratings rolled in.

It’s a pivotal release for Warner Bros., as it comes after news that its parent company, Warner Bros. Discovery, is planning to split into two public companies. The studio has a lot riding financially on “Superman,” which reportedly had a $363.8 million budget. The studio is also operating in a supercharged political environment as Trump pressures media organizations to acquiesce to his demands, accusing them of political bias.

A representative for Warner Bros. did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

In the Times interview, Gunn admitted that the film is about politics, but added that it’s also ""about human kindness.""

“This Superman does seem to come at a particular time when people are feeling a loss of hope in other people’s goodness,” Gunn added. “I’m telling a story about a guy who is uniquely good, and that feels needed now because there is a meanness that has emerged due to cultural figures being mean online.”

Fans such as Jack Deegan, who runs a YouTube channel about comic books and their film adaptations, said that the political elements of Superman’s story have been clear from the beginning: He’s an alien who grew up in Kansas as a refugee after entering the United States illegally.

“It’s such a core, foundational element of his character that I feel like you would have to be reading it completely incorrectly to miss the point of who Superman is that much, to not even notice the fact that he has all of these themes tied into his origin story,” Deegan said.

Online, fans of the superhero also expressed incredulity that critics didn’t already know he was an immigrant. Many noted that Superman has always been political, and that the comic series was also created by sons of Jewish immigrants in 1938 — as Hitler’s Nazi Germany was persecuting Jews.

Deegan said it’s “bizarre” to see the controversy that’s emerged around Superman’s supposedly “woke” politics when the character has long been described in comics as a “champion of the oppressed,” often fighting against corruption and for the working class. His primary archnemesis is Lex Luthor, a billionaire obsessed with power.

Deegan noted that many past adaptations of the DC Comics superhero have explored political themes. In 1987’s “Superman IV: The Quest for Peace,” the hero took on nuclear proliferation, for instance. Some included storylines that involve Superman’s immigration status as a direct plot point.

The TV series “Smallville,” which aired from 2001 to 2011 on WB and then CW, focuses on the teenage Clark Kent (Tom Welling) in his fictional hometown. In the ninth episode of the sixth season, Clark rescues another undocumented immigrant, Javier, from police.

“Was it legal when you forged my adoption papers?” Clark responds when his mother refuses to illegally harbor Javier in a clip that has been recirculated across social media. “I’m an illegal immigrant, Mom. You’ve been harboring me for over 17 years.”

In one issue of the original Superman comic series, Superman defends a group of undocumented immigrants from a hate crime when a man opens fire on them, accusing them of stealing his job. And in the recent comic adaptation “Absolute Superman,” Superman’s immigrant experience is central to the story as he lives among other immigrant workers, stateless.

At the film’s red carpet premiere in Los Angeles on Monday, Gunn responded to the mounting backlash from right-wing commentators, telling Variety that he doesn’t have “anything to say to anybody” spreading negativity around the film.

Nathan Fillion, who plays the Green Lantern in Gunn’s “Superman,” also laughed when asked for his response by Variety.

“Aw, somebody needs a hug,” Fillion told the publication. “It’s just a movie, guys. It’s just a movie.”

James Gunn’s brother Sean Gunn, who plays the supervillain business magnate Maxwell Lord, said that Superman's being an immigrant “is exactly what the movie is about, I think: That we support our people, you know? We love our immigrants.”

“Yes, Superman is an immigrant, and yes, the people that we support in this country are immigrants and if you don’t like that, then you’re not American,” Gunn told Variety at the premiere. “People who say no to immigrants are against the American way. They’re against what the American Dream is all about.”",NewsAPI,-5.61,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,42.76,"nbc news, NBC, nbcnews.com  ",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/nbc-news/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/nbc-news-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER (-3.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,MOSTLY FREE,TV Station,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Comcast,1940,-1.8,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,nbcnews.com,,nbc news,24,USA,,,,

BBC The UN says the hunger crisis in Gaza 'has never been so dire'

One in five children in Gaza City is malnourished and cases are increasing every day, the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) says. In a statement issued on Thursday, Unrwa Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini cited a colleague telling him: ""People in Gaza are neither dead nor alive, they are walking corpses."" More than 100 international aid organisations and human rights groups have also warned of mass starvation - pressing for governments to take action. Israel, which controls the entry of all supplies into Gaza, says there is no siege and blames Hamas for any cases of malnutrition.

The UN, however, has warned that the level of aid getting into Gaza is ""a trickle"" and the hunger crisis in the territory ""has never been so dire"". In his statement on Thursday, Lazzarini said ""more than 100 people, the vast majority of them children, have reportedly died of hunger"". ""Most children our teams are seeing are emaciated, weak and at high risk of dying if they don't get the treatment they urgently need,"" he said, pleading for Israel to ""allow humanitarian partners to bring unrestricted and uninterrupted humanitarian assistance to Gaza"". Unrwa workers are ""increasingly fainting from hunger while at work"", according to Lazzarini, who added: ""When caretakers cannot find enough to eat, the entire humanitarian system is collapsing"". On Wednesday, the World Health Organisation (WHO) said a large proportion of the population of Gaza was ""starving"". ""I don't know what you would call it other than mass starvation - and it's man-made,"" the head of the WHO, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said.

In northern Gaza, Hanaa Almadhoun, 40, said local markets are often without food and other supplies. ""If they do exist then they come at exorbitant prices that no ordinary person can afford,"" she told the BBC over WhatsApp. She said flour was expensive and difficult to secure, and that people have sold ""gold and personal belongings"" to afford it. The mother-of-three said ""every new day brings a new challenge"" as people search for ""something edible"".

Israel stopped aid deliveries to Gaza in early March following a two-month ceasefire. The blockade was partially eased after nearly two months, but food, fuel and medicine shortages worsened. Israel, with the US, established a new aid system run by the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF). According to the UN human rights office, more than 1,000 Palestinians have been killed by the Israeli military while trying to get food aid over the past two months.

It says at least 766 of them have been killed in the vicinity of one of the GHF's four distribution centres, which are operated by US private security contractors and are located inside Israeli military zones. Another 288 people have been reported killed near UN and other aid convoys. Israel has accused Hamas of instigating the chaos near the aid sites. It says its troops have only fired warning shots and that they do not intentionally shoot civilians. The GHF says the UN is using ""false"" figures from Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry.

In their joint statement, the organisations demanded an immediate and permanent ceasefire and the full removal of all restrictions on aid delivery. They condemned the Israeli government’s siege for creating conditions of “chaos, starvation, and death”, citing that food, clean water, and medical supplies are unable to reach those in need due to severe access restrictions.

At least 10 Palestinians have died of forced starvation in the past 24 hours in Gaza, bringing the death toll from hunger to 111, including at least 80 children, according to the territory’s Ministry of Health.

More than 800 Palestinians have been killed in recent weeks while attempting to reach food, mostly in mass shootings by Israeli forces near Israel- and United States-backed GHF distribution points. The agency has come under sharp criticism, including from the United Nations, for its lack of neutrality and for allowing military involvement in aid distribution.

Mahmoud Basal, civil defence spokesman, told AFP news agency there were multiple Israeli strikes on Gaza City overnight and early morning on Sunday, resulting in eight deaths, “including women and children” with additional injuries reported.

An Israeli attack on a home near the Nuseirat refugee camp in the south of Gaza City caused “10 martyrs and several injured”, he said.

An Israeli drone attack in central Gaza “hit a potable water distribution point in an area for displaced people”, killing eight Palestinians, including six children, with several others wounded.

Additionally, three people died when Israeli jets struck a tent housing displaced Palestinians in the southern coastal area of al-Mawasi, according to Basal.

On Saturday, Israeli forces killed at least 110 Palestinians across Gaza, including 34 people waiting for food at the controversial GHF distribution site in Rafah.

At least 10 Palestinians have been killed at a water collection point in central Gaza, six of them children, as famine spreads in the besieged enclave and food and water supplies remain at critically low levels.

Israeli forces on Sunday killed at least 92 Palestinians, 52 of them in Gaza City, as they targeted residential areas and displacement camps across Gaza, medical and local sources told Al Jazeera.

The attack on the water distribution point in Nuseirat refugee camp, which also wounded 16 people, came as the Israeli military steps up attacks as it prepares to force the entire population of Gaza into a concentration zone in the south.

Al Jazeera’s Hani Mahmoud, reporting from Gaza City, said there is a water crisis across the Gaza Strip.

“Even though water is not suitable for drinking as most of the time it’s contaminated, thirst is pushing people to these areas,” he said, referring to Nuseirat.

“This is not the first time it’s happening. This is close to 10 times and just in the past few months when people were directly and deliberately targeted as they were trying to get water.”

Israel’s relentless bombardment of Gaza killed at least 110 Palestinians on Saturday, including 34 people waiting for food at the Israeli- and United States-backed Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF) aid distribution site in Rafah.

Mahmoud said nearly 800 Palestinians have been killed since the GHF began distributing food parcels in Gaza at the end of May through its “monopoly of humanitarian aid distribution”, pushing aside other efficient, more organised and trusted organisations, including the United Nations.

“A person can pick up a food parcel for their family, but that is not nearly enough to feed hungry children and hungry family members, and that’s the tragedy,” he said.

“People are forced to make these dangerous trips from northern Gaza, from Gaza City, all the way to Rafah city. They walk for 12 to 15km [7.5 to 9 miles], and it takes them a whole day. Some do that at night, sleeping inside bombed-out buildings, to get there as early as possible. Despite all of these efforts to get there as early as possible, they are met with live ammunition and deliberate shooting by Israeli forces.”

At least 67 children have died of hunger in Gaza since October 2023, Gaza’s Government Media Office said on Saturday.

Furthermore, UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, warned of a sharp rise in malnutrition cases as Israel’s blockade of the coastal enclave entered its 103rd day.

In a statement, the agency said one of its clinics in Gaza has seen an increase in the number of malnutrition cases since March when the Israeli siege started. “UNRWA hasn’t been allowed to bring in any humanitarian aid since,” it said.

The warnings came as Israeli forces continued to target starving Palestinians.

On Sunday, an Israeli warplane struck a house in the al-Sawarkah area west of the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 10 people.

In the northern Gaza Strip, six Palestinians were killed and others injured when an Israeli warplane bombed a house in the Shati refugee camp west of Gaza City.

Five others were killed and several more injured in a separate air strike that hit a house on Hamid Street in western Gaza City.

In the al-Sabra neighbourhood of Gaza City, a girl and another person were killed and several injured when Israeli forces bombed a home there.

In southern Gaza, Nasser Medical Complex medics confirmed the deaths of three people after an Israeli strike on a displacement tent in the al-Mawasi area west of Khan Younis city.

Meanwhile, Israeli forces blew up several residential buildings in the Tuffah neighbourhood in eastern Gaza City.

The strikes came amid an apparent deadlock in a week of indirect talks in Qatar between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas for a ceasefire to halt the 21-month war.

Rejecting international calls for a ceasefire, the Israeli army has pursued a genocidal offensive on Gaza since October 7, 2023, killing more than 58,000 Palestinians so far, most of them women and children.

Almost the entire population of more than 2 million people in Gaza have been forcibly displaced at least once during the war, which has created dire humanitarian conditions in the Palestinian territory.

An Israeli strike on a vehicle near the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli has killed at least three people and injured 13 others, Lebanon’s Health Ministry says, in the latest breach of a ceasefire between the two countries.

The attack in the Ayrounieh area on Tuesday came as Israel intensifies its strikes in Lebanon amid Hezbollah’s weakened position, the Lebanese army’s inability to fight back and the international community’s failure to pressure Israel to abide by the truce.

The strike near Lebanon’s northernmost major city – more than 180km (110 miles) from the Israeli border – highlights Israel’s willingness to launch assaults across the country, not just in the south.

The Israeli military claimed that it struck a “key” figure from the Palestinian group Hamas without identifying the target.

A Hamas source in Lebanon told Al Araby TV that no senior official from the group was killed in the strike. Lebanon’s Annahar newspaper reported that initial reports indicated that the assassination attempt might have failed.

Hamas and other Palestinian groups maintain a presence in various areas of Lebanon, mostly in refugee camps that have housed Palestinians for decades. Tripoli is home to the large Beddawi Palestinian refugee camp.

Since the outbreak of the war in Gaza in October 2023, Israel has carried out attacks against the Lebanese group Hezbollah and members of Palestinian factions in Lebanon.

Hamas’s deputy chief Saleh al-Arouri was killed in an Israeli air strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs in early 2024.

While the ceasefire last year ended the conflict, Israel has continued to carry out strikes on what it says are Hezbollah arms depots and fighters, mostly in southern Lebanon. Israeli attacks have also targeted homes, municipal workers and civilian infrastructure.

On Monday, at least one person was killed in a suspected Israeli air attack on a van in the town of Deir Kifa in southern Lebanon.

The recent attacks were launched as United States envoy Thomas Barrack was in Lebanon for a two-day visit to discuss disarming Hezbollah.

On Monday after meeting Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, Barrack told reporters he was “unbelievably satisfied” with Lebanon’s reply to a US proposal on taking away Hezbollah’s weapons.

Barrack, a longtime adviser to US President Donald Trump who also serves as US ambassador to Turkiye and special envoy for Syria, said he believed “the Israelis do not want war with Lebanon”.

“Both countries are trying to give the same thing – the notion of a stand-down agreement, of the cessation of hostilities and a road to peace,” he said.

The plight of Rohingya refugees in Bangladesh could rapidly deteriorate further unless more funding can be secured for critical assistance services, according to the United Nations refugee agency.

Bangladesh has registered its biggest influx of Myanmar’s largest Muslim minority over the past 18 months since a mass exodus from an orchestrated campaign of death, rape and persecution nearly a decade ago by Myanmar’s military.

“There is a huge gap in terms of what we need and what resources are available. These funding gaps will affect the daily living of Rohingya refugees as they depend on humanitarian support on a daily basis for food, health and education,” United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) spokesperson Babar Baloch told reporters in Geneva on Friday.

The humanitarian sector has been roiled by funding reductions from major donors, led by the United States under President Donald Trump and other Western countries, as they prioritise defence spending prompted by growing concerns over Russia and China.

Baloch added: “With the acute global funding crisis, the critical needs of both newly arrived refugees and those already present will be unmet, and essential services for the whole Rohingya refugee population are at risk of collapsing unless additional funds are secured.”

If not enough funding is secured, health services will be severely disrupted by September, and by December, essential food assistance will stop, said the UNHCR, which says that its appeal for $255m has only been 35 percent funded.

In March, the World Food Programme announced that “severe funding shortfalls” for Rohingya were forcing a cut in monthly food vouchers from $12.50 to $6 per person.

More than one million Rohingya have been crammed into camps in southeastern Bangladesh, the world’s largest refugee settlement. Most fled the brutal crackdown in 2017 by Myanmar’s military, although some have been there for longer.

These camps cover an area of just 24 square kilometres (nine square miles) and have become “one of the world’s most densely populated places”, said Baloch.

Continued violence and persecution against the Rohingya, a mostly Muslim minority in mainly Buddhist Myanmar’s western Rakhine state, have kept forcing thousands to seek protection across the border in Bangladesh, according to the UNHCR. At least 150,000 Rohingya refugees have arrived in Cox’s Bazar in southeast Bangladesh over the past 18 months.

The Rohingya refugees also face institutionalised discrimination in Myanmar and most are denied citizenship.

“Targeted violence and persecution in Rakhine State and the ongoing conflict in Myanmar have continued to force thousands of Rohingya to seek protection in Bangladesh,” said Baloch. “This movement of Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh, spread over months, is the largest from Myanmar since 2017, when some 750,000 fled the deadly violence in their native Rakhine State.”

Baloch also hailed Muslim-majority Bangladesh for generously hosting Rohingya refugees for generations.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,

When he was 10, Revolori tried out for the part of a Refugee Kid in Afghanistan. A massive fan of Marvel Comics since childhood, as well as an admirer of Robert Downey Jr.'s performance in ""Chaplin"" and Jon Favreau's performance in ""Swingers,"" Revolori was ecstatic about the opportunity, although it did not work out in his favor. He reflected on the opportunity in an article he wrote for Fandom:

""My brother and I waited in Sarah Finn's office; she's the casting director for all the MCU movies. I was auditioning for the huge part of... ""Refugee Kid."" Remember that scene where Iron Man is in Afghanistan, and he lands just in time to see families getting separated, with the men walking to a firing squad while the women and children are being forced on a truck? (Wow, Iron Man was kind of dark!) They're all about to be killed until Iron Man swoops in and saves the day, and there's a kid in that scene that runs out of his mother's arms to his dad. That's right, that kid could've been me.""

Over a decade ago, Sony Pictures and Marvel Studios announced their intention to bring Spider-Man into the MCU, following the underperformance of ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2."" Around the same time of the announcement, Tony Revolori emailed his agents regarding the opportunity to audition for the role as the MCU's Peter Parker, to which he would receive an email a month later revealing that he had the opportunity to audition for said role. Reflecting on the audition process, Revolori, who is of Guatemalan descent, recalls seeing ""every young white Hollywood actor"" in the waiting area, which put a damper on his confidence because he doubted Marvel Studios would take a chance casting a non-white actor as their new Spidey.

Two days after his audition, Tony Revolori received the news that it did not work out. However, by the time he received a new email regarding an ""Untitled Marvel Movie,"" he knew it was another opportunity to audition for what would become ""Spider-Man: Homecoming."" Revolori was considered for both Ned Leeds and Flash Thompson, ultimately getting cast in the latter role, which was a considerable departure from the previous versions played by Joe Manganiello in Sam Raimi's trilogy and Chris Zylka in ""The Amazing Spider-Man.""

852,87,The Rise of AI Is Making Life Even Harder for Real People in Gaza,https://gizmodo.com/the-rise-of-ai-is-making-life-even-harder-for-real-people-in-gaza-2000607395,2025-07-05T10:00:32Z,Gizmodo.com,GB,refugee,"Saeed Ismail is a real person. But no matter how much proof he posts online, people keep calling him fake.

The 22-year-old has endured almost two years of war in Gaza, as Israel continues an assault that has killed at least 57,000 people and left the territory of 2 million on the brink of starvation. Saeed has been raising money online to feed his family. But many people on social media have been convinced that he isn’t real at all. They believe he’s an AI-generated creation, used by scammers to get donations through crowdfunding platforms from well-meaning people. And in a world where AI videos and images have flooded our digital spaces, it’s easy to understand why some people are so skeptical.

The controversy started with a photo posted in May that features Saeed asking for help. Users of the social media platform Bluesky started accusing him of being fake. A pseudonymous account called Rev. Howard Arson led the charges against Saeed, pointing out his blanket had some odd words woven within it.

Arson pointed to two words on the blanket: “pealistic” and “spfcation,” which seemed to be misspellings of “realistic” and “specification.” Arson suspected that it was evidence the image was made with AI, a result of someone asking an artificial intelligence tool to make a realistic blanket and spitting this out:

Saeed posted several photos and a video showing the blanket to prove it was real, but that didn’t put the accusations to rest. He told Gizmodo his mother purchased the blanket from a market near where he lived in northern Gaza before the war: “When I left the house during the evacuation, I took it with me.”

People were convinced that AI video has become advanced enough that Saeed could be a completely artificial being—an AI agent, as Arson told Gizmodo over direct messages. Arson, who has over 20,000 followers on Bluesky, was getting a lot of attention for his claims, helping them spread across the relatively niche social network. Saeed didn’t know what he could do, as the account seemed to have more influence than he could ever attain.

“When I went on Bluesky, I saw that many people had started to believe I was a fraud, mainly because of the status of the person who posted about me,” Saeed told Gizmodo over WhatsApp. “He’s seen as a trustworthy figure by many, while unfortunately, I don’t have the same following or credibility.”

Gizmodo verified Saeed’s existence as a real person through a variety of means, including a video call where he walked around the room and showed us the view out of his window. He provided us with his Palestinian ID as well as photos and videos of his location. Saeed told Gizmodo he previously raiseed money on PayPal but now fundraises on GoFundMe through a campaign run by a person he trusts in France who sends him the money. After it gets to France, the money is sent through wire transfers into Gaza, which he says is “reliable and secure,” explaining, “We rely on these channels because we simply have no other options available.”

GoFundMe doesn’t operate in Gaza but allows people in countries where it does operate to host fundraisers for people in other countries. It has a tutorial on its website for how to do that safely. The GoFundMe team collects documentation like IDs, receipts for expenses, and other proof to make sure funds are delivered to the beneficiary. A spokesperson from GoFundMe told Gizmodo it has verified Saeed’s campaign.

“During humanitarian disasters and other crises, our team proactively monitors and verifies fundraisers to help ensure funds raised on our platform are delivered quickly and safely,” a GoFundMe spokesperson told Gizmodo in a statement.

“When a GoFundMe fundraiser is created, we prioritize distributing funds while also helping ensure compliance with relevant international laws, global regulations, and requirements dictated by our payment processors,” the spokesperson continued. “We’re working around the clock to help ensure humanitarian relief funds are delivered safely and quickly to those in need, helping families access essentials, rebuild, and recover through the generosity of their communities.”

Whoever runs the Arson account declined to provide their real name, let alone jump through the same hoops as Saeed to prove his identity to Gizmodo and GoFundMe. “Unfortunately i don’t want a claim i can’t prove connected to my name, which is why—even though i’m very skeptical still—i took down the actual claim and any references directly to the guy in question,” Arson told Gizmodo over Bluesky.

Arson told Gizmodo he’s an American and recognized his country was helping Israel flatten Gaza and kill tens of thousands of people. But he remained unconvinced that Saeed was a real person and seemed frustrated that AI had become so advanced he wasn’t sure what to believe. Arson, who seems to have great familiarity with AI systems, struggles with what to believe, especially when it comes to whether giving money is a good thing.

“I have no idea whatsoever what it is like to be there. i know i would do or say literally anything to eat,” Arson wrote. “But this is why it is absolutely impossible to evaluate whether you are actually doing any good! on one end you have people with money and on the other you have people paying $300 for a bag of lentils in a manufactured and intentional famine.”

Arson acknowledged that his perspective could be warped by seeing so many fake images created with AI.

“The way people get this stuff wrong, and the way I possibly have, is that they end up in a world where half the stuff they look at is synthetic and half of it is real, and presume that 50/50 is the distriubtion [sic] everywhere they look,” Arson told Gizmodo.

Arson pointed to another example of a photo that he previously thought was fake but is actually real. The image shows a woman and two kids sitting in the rubble of Gaza. All three people are wearing sandals, though the boy’s left leg has a white plaster cast. But it was the woman’s sandal that raised suspicions.

The sandal has a panda head logo, along with an odd mix of words: “HAPPY LUCKY rlorE DNUI.” It’s the kind of thing that would immediately raise red flags for anyone on the lookout for AI images being circulated online. The strange thing is that the sandals are real.

Arson found the same sandals being sold on Facebook in a listing from an online shop in Benghazi, Libya back in June 2022. Not only were the sandals seen in the photo from Gaza available for purchase, proving they existed in the real world, but they even came in a variety of colors.

Gizmodo spoke with the woman in the photo, Sahar AlAjrami, over video call to verify she was a real person in Gaza. Her English is not great, so her younger brother, Ahmed, worked as a translator for us, showing the sandals lit by cellphone light in the middle of the night. GoFundMe told Gizmodo that the fundraising campaigns for both Sahar, who’s trying to raise money to feed her children, and Ahmed have been verified as authentic.

It’s not clear who designed the sandals bearing such mangled English, but they are absolutely real. And it’s perhaps notable that June 2022 predates the first widely available AI image generators, which didn’t really open up to the public until late 2022. ChatGPT, which officially kicked off the consumer-facing generative-AI race, was launched to the public in November 2022.

Sahar is most concerned for her 10-year-old son Odai, who was shot in the foot by an Israeli quadcopter drone. While amateur sleuths on the internet were fixated on her sandals, it was her son’s foot in that photo that should’ve been drawing the attention. Sahar says painkillers and other medicines aren’t being allowed into Gaza and she hopes she can get him to Egypt for treatment. That’s an impossibility at the moment, as Israel has shut down all of the crossings.

Gazans like Sahar and Saeed are far from the only people having a hard time proving their identities in a skeptical social media environment. Bluesky has received criticism from activists in recent months as Palestinians in Gaza struggle to survive but are getting banned left and right for allegedly being scammers or bots. Hany Abu Hilal is an English teacher in Gaza with three young kids that Gizmodo also verified as a real person through his Palestinian ID and a video call. He started a crowdfunding campaign on Chuffed, but he keeps getting his accounts deleted on Bluesky for spam.

“My flat was completely burnt and then completely destroyed,” he told Gizmodo, explaining that he lives in a tent in Khan Younis which can’t shield them properly from the heat or the cold. Hany said he was banned from Bluesky without a clear explanation and he’s desperate because he can’t ask for help online in spaces that keep deleting Palestinian accounts.

“Basic food prices are skyrocket here in Gaza. Can’t even bring a loaf of bread for my three kids because I am jobless and I do not have money,” Hany told Gizmodo. The Israeli government has total control of what goes in and out of Gaza and recently had a two-month total blockade of food and supplies into the territory. That blockade has been loosened, but only a minimal amount as people struggle to find the basic necessities to live. At least 549 people in Gaza have been killed in recent weeks near aid sites, according to the CBC, and more than 4,000 have been injured trying to access food from the so-called Gaza Humanitarian Foundation (GHF), a U.S.-based group registered to an empty office in Delaware. Reporting from the Associated Press suggests it’s not just the Israeli military but U.S. contractors who have fired on crowds of Palestinians trying to get aid.

Hany says he’s had to evacuate 12 times since the start of the war, a common story for people who have been internally displaced by Israel’s invasion of Gaza. The vast majority of Gaza’s population have had to leave their homes, and Israel has announced plans to completely “conquer” the territory, with many politicians talking openly about ethnically cleansing the area. While we’ve verified Hany is a real person, we were unable to reach Chuffed, a fundraising site based in Australia, to get more information about their processes for verifying campaigns.

Hany has struggled on Bluesky, which has exploded in popularity ever since Elon Musk bought Twitter and renamed it X. And perhaps no English-language account on Bluesky has done more to raise awareness of the Palestinian plight on the platform than Molly Shah, a 45-year-old American activist based in Berlin. Shah is originally from Kentucky, and she tells Gizmodo that she moved to Germany in 2017 and has previously worked as a lawyer fighting eviction cases. Molly says the people she talks to in Gaza struggle with social media users calling them fake.

“I talk to people every single day who have seen and faced some of the worst things you can possibly imagine, and the most distressing conversations I have are often around losing their accounts or being called scammers,” Molly said. “I think that is because people in Gaza have lost almost everything, but the one thing they do have left is their identities, and being banned or called fake attacks even that.”

Molly has spotted fakes on Bluesky and acknowledges that there are scammers trying to take advantage of the situation. But they are the minority, and she’s shared things to look out for, including people who only use news photos for their fundraising campaigns.

Bluesky told Gizmodo that it understands people in Gaza need platforms to share their experiences and seek support, saying the company is “committed to ensuring they can be heard on Bluesky.” But the platform said that its moderation teams have to “distinguish between genuine advocacy and coordinated inauthentic behavior.”

“In some cases, our investigations have revealed networks where single individuals operate hundreds of accounts engaging in bulk messaging, identical replies across unrelated conversations, and mass following—behaviors that disrupt the platform experience for all users regardless of the underlying cause,” Aaron Rodericks, Bluesky’s Head of Trust & Safety, told Gizmodo over email.

“When we identify these patterns, we provide warnings and opportunities for users to adjust their approach before any suspensions occur. In other cases, malicious actors create bulk networks of accounts to target users on Bluesky and exploit goodwill towards crises,” Rodericks continued.

The social media company told Gizmodo that its moderation decisions “aren’t always perfect, which is why we maintain an appeals process,” but said users need to focus on operating a single account that follows community guidelines. Rodericks said it would be “publishing more guidance in the near-term to help advocacy accounts stay within our rules while sharing their messages,” but didn’t respond to Gizmodo’s follow-up questions about when that guidance would be coming.

Even if Americans do find a fundraising campaign they trust, some folks are worried about what the U.S. government will do to them if they donate to people in Gaza, given the authoritarian and anti-Muslim tendencies of the Trump administration. Trump has previously said all of Gaza should be purged of Palestinians and that the U.S. should take ownership of the territory. And that has translated to terrifying actions in the U.S. domestically.

Trump has been enacting racist and often illegal policies targeting foreign students, with a special emphasis on attacking people protesting against Israel’s war on Gaza. Rumeysa Ozturk, a 30-year-old Turkish citizen and graduate student at Tufts University, was picked up off the street in Massachusetts by masked agents in an infamous video that went viral back in March. Ozturk’s “crime” was co-authoring an op-ed in the student newspaper defending the principles of free speech. But it’s not illegal for Americans to donate to fundraising campaigns for the average person just trying to survive in Gaza. At least, not yet.

The problem, which we always return to, is that it’s getting really hard to tell when someone is a scammer. Google’s latest AI video creation tool, Veo 3, has been a game-changer that further muddies the waters. When Time magazine published a report on the tool recently, the news outlet created a video of fake Gazans receiving aid from USAID—which brings us to the people accused of being fake on the other side of this war.

The Gaza Humanitarian Foundation, backed by Israel and the U.S., has been accused of running an unsafe and ineffective aid organization that’s getting hundreds of people killed. But it’s also been accused of making fake videos. One video created by the GHF and distributed to right-wing news outlets like the Daily Wire was understandably called fake when it was published on social media in late May. Anyone looking at it can see that it does have that kind of unusual AI-style quality that’s hard to define.

A source at one of the Gaza distribution sites tells me that Hamas set up a roadblock to prevent Gazans from getting aid. They broke through it and were shouting “thank you America” upon reaching the site. pic.twitter.com/5bfRoy6mcO — Kassy Akiva (@KassyAkiva) May 27, 2025

Reached for comment over email, an unnamed spokesperson for GHF told Gizmodo the video is real, sending along a screenshot of metadata from an iPhone 15 Pro showing where it was taken in Gaza. GHF initially offered to let Gizmodo speak with the cameraman but didn’t send us the raw video file we asked for and never connected us with the cameraman who was “on a plane back to America.” GHF has given contradictory statements publicly about its activities, with the head of the organization Johnnie Moore recently telling the BBC that no one had died near their aid distribution sites before saying he wasn’t contesting that people had died just a few minutes later.

How does anyone know what’s real in that kind of environment? It was a difficult question for people on the internet, even before the invention of generative AI image creators. Gizmodo has been debunking viral photos for over a decade, and many viral fakes even predate the invention of Photoshop by decades. But AI has changed the game in so many ways. And AI images and videos will only get more sophisticated.

Another problem in deciphering what’s real in Gaza is that Israel doesn’t allow foreign journalists into the territory. The IDF has sometimes escorted TV journalists in for brief periods of time, without allowing communication between the journalists and average Palestinians on the ground, but that obviously amounts to a highly controlled media event. Even if the average American has the budget to fly halfway around the world to go check out Gaza for themselves, they’re simply not allowed to do that. So people are forced to either figure out their own ways of determining what’s real or just throwing up their hands and deciding it’s too hard to authenticate.

But people in Gaza continue to suffer, with no end in sight. The health infrastructure in Gaza has been obliterated, with hospitals becoming “battlegrounds,” as experts at the United Nations have put it. The toll has been immense, with children getting hit particularly hard. Over 50,000 kids have been killed or injured since October 2023, according to figures from UNICEF. And researchers estimate the actual death toll is much higher than the official number that currently stands at over 58,000.

Yet people continue to call the atrocities fake. There are entire accounts on X, which became an extremist far-right platform after it was purchased by Elon Musk in late 2022, that are dedicated to so-called “Pallywood,” a play on the name Hollywood, which allege the people of Gaza are faking the war crimes being committed against them.

At the end of the day, there are no easy solutions. Avoiding scams can be hard as AI infects every corner of the internet. But surviving a genocide is much, much harder.",NewsAPI,,,not found,,,,,,https://ground.news/interest/gizmodo,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/gizmodo,LEAST BIASED (-1.6),HIGH (1.0),USA,,Newspaper,Medium Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,Univision Communications,2002,-2,Lean Left,High,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,gizmodo.com,88,USA,,,,
853,59,Matty Brown Talks ‘The Sand Castle’ As Migrant Drama Becomes Most Watched Arabic Language Title On Netflix In First Half Of 2025,http://deadline.com/2025/08/matty-brown-most-watched-arabic-drama-sand-castle-netflix-1236476410/,2025-08-04T14:00:00Z,Deadline,GB,refugee,"The image of the lifeless body of two-year-old Kurdish-Syrian boy Alan Kurdi lying washed up on a Turkish beach shocked the world in September 2015.

His death, alongside that of his mother and brother, came to symbolize the tragedy of the refugee crisis unfolding across the Mediterranean basin in the wake of now deposed Syrian dictator Bashar Al-Assad’s suppression of a pro-democracy campaign which began in 2011.

U.S. director Matty Brown recounts how he was doubly shaken by the photo because it chimed with a short story he had written while homeless as a child.

“It was based on a dream I had where there’s a little boy on an island. His mom and dad were there, but they kind of disappeared. The island is sinking, and the boy doesn’t know how to swim and he’s trying to make sense of what is going on,” he explains.

“The image made me sob my eyes out because that’s the story I wrote when I was homeless but didn’t have an ending, and then suddenly there was this ending, this biblical event happening, of people getting on boats and trying to get across this body of water to freedom,” he says.

This connection would be the catalyst for his debut feature, the migrant drama The Sand Castle, which was revealed by Netflix last month as being the platform’s most watched Arabic-language movie in the first six months of 2025, garnering 10.8M views and 17.4M hours watched by a wide margin.

In rankings, it came around 36 in the non-English movie chart, and 229 in the overall chart covering the 8,860 movies available on Netflix during the period. While coverage of the Netflix data dump rightly focused on the performances of Adolescence and Back In Action, The Sand Castle numbers are also impressive for an Arabic-language arthouse movie.

Lebanese actress and director Nadine Labaki; Zain Al Rafeea, the Syrian refugee star of her Cannes Jury Prize winner and Oscar-nominated film Capernaum; his sister Riman Al Rafeea, and Palestinian actor Ziad Bakri (The Translator, A Stranger’s Case) star as members of a family seemingly marooned on a small sinking island.

How they got there is unexplained, but it is clear their situation is desperate as the parents attempt to make radio-contact with a mysterious entity they hope will pick them up in the face of rising waters and dwindling supplies.

Details of their past life emerge in fragments, with flashbacks to a life destroyed by armed conflict, and a sudden, heartbreaking unveiling of their true predicament in the final minutes of the film.

Brown reveals that story is told through the traumatized mind of the young daughter.

“It’s a very intimate film. It’s not trying to preach but rather boil down how does a child’s mind react to trauma. We’re basically watching her mind crumble before our eyes,” he says.

“I couldn’t just go straight into a refugee film because the audience would never watch that, but if you disguise it in this girl’s mind… it’s like an explosion in reverse, you’re in the fog, you don’t know where you are, what’s happening and then slowly by the end it all becomes clear what has really happened.”

The fragmentary and allegorical nature of the storytelling has sparked scores of posts from spectators and film bloggers dissecting what is happening in the film, with some comparing Brown’s work to that of Michel Gondry and Alejandro González Iñárritu.

Brown tapped into his own difficult childhood to capture the mechanics of the young girl’s mind as it oscillates between a harsh reality, memory and fantasy.

“I had a pretty tumultuous childhood. I was homeless for much of it, and there was a period of 10 months, when I was about 12 years old, when I on the streets,” he recounts.

“I would lie at school because I thought I would be arrested for being homeless… I was staying in a friend’s carport… trying to track my mom down, going from bar to bar… you have to lie, to build yourself a sort of fortress and live in your imagination to survive.”

The Sand Castle marks Brown’s feature directorial debut after a slew of award-winning short films, including Skipping Stones, The Piano and Dreamcatcher.

He credits longtime friend and the movie’s lead producer Mandy Ward with getting him to write the screenplay and then getting the production over the line.

“Mandy was the seed of the film. She was a cheerleader. She lit a fire under my butt and said, ‘You need to write this, like now, sit down and just write it out… this is such an amazing concept and allegory’,” says Brown.

Ward, who started out in the film business as a location manager, previously produced a handful of Brown’s shorts. She is currently working on post-production for Rachel Israel’s comedy Miracle On 74th Street.

She brought on New York-based producer Houston King and together they set about packaging the film, first setting their sights on Capernaum star Zain Al Rafeea.

Beyond his performance in Labaki’s award-winning film, Al Rafeea’s experiences growing up as a Syrian refugee in Lebanon, before resettling in Norway in 2018, chimed with the story.

This, in turn, introduced the production to Labaki because the actress was the first port of call for connecting with the young actor, who she has continued to mentor.

“She wanted to read it for Zain,” said Ward.

After securing Zain, the production signed Bakri, for the role of the father, after which Labaki’s involvement fell into place.

“Nadine was always poking around. She loved Matty, loved the idea of the script and had been heavily involved in getting Zain attached. She thought it would be good for Zain’s career and wanted to see him succeed… when the ask went out to her to play the mother, it took a bit, but she said ‘yes’.”

It was at this point, that Gianluca Chakra, CEO of pan-Arab distributor and production company Front Row Filmed Entertainment came on board. He, in turn, attached Netflix as well as longtime collaborator Mario Jr. Haddad, CEO of pan-Arab distributor Empire Entertainment.

Chakra’s relationship with Labaki as well as with Netflix, for which he had recently produced the hit Arabic-language remake of Perfect Strangers, made him a game-changing partner.

“Gianluca, and I can’t this say enough, became a champion of Matty. This film is hard, and it takes an extraordinary person to push it through the ranks. Luckily, he had a successful film on Netflix, Perfect Strangers, so he had the power to push.”

The next challenge was the shoot, with the feature filming on location in September 2022 on Rabbits Island (aka Palm Island), a nature reserve lying some 3.5 miles (5.5 km) off the coast of the city of Tripoli in northern Lebanon.

“When we decided this would be Matty’s first film, I envisaged a shoot in one location, and we end up with kids on an island… it was his dream and maybe a producer’s nightmare,” jokes Ward, who mustered her location manager experience to make it happen.

With the help of local line producer Raja Zgheib, the production secured permission to film on the island once it had been closed to the public at the end of the summer visiting season.

“We were so nervous about these weeks because we had to be on and off the island at a certain time, otherwise you get stuck, but it ended up being this beautiful thing, heading out before sunrise, and returning as the sun was setting,” recalls Ward.

Given Rabbits Island is a nature reserve no trace of the shoot could be left behind.

“The saddest day on set was the day we had to tear down the lighthouse… everybody sat there and cried as we watched it being taken apart.” says Ward.

Brown says he overcame the challenge of shooting in Arabic with human empathy, and ended up being able to speak and understand the language by the end of the production.

“It’s weird because Zain and I, and don’t know if it’s because we’re both Scorpios or what, but we had this connection. Also, Zain has this thing with him that’s crazy: he comes in, does the first take, and it’s like, perfect. It was so smooth with him that he just got it immediately,” recalls Brown.

“He said, ‘Look, I don’t need to act. I’ve already lived this. I know how it feels. I know the emotions.’ He can turn it on and off. It’s incredible what he can do. I hope he just starts taking off like crazy, because he is one of those actors with a range that is unbelievable.”

Aside from celebration, the revelation in Netflix’s July data dump that The Sand Castle was the most-watched Arabic movie on the platform in the first half of 2025 also marks a moment of vindication for Brown and his producers.

The movie originally hit the platform one week after Back in Action on January 24 without fanfare and no press.

“I kept seeing all these big billboards for Back in Action all over town,” says Brown as he reflects on the lack of promotion on his film.

There was no explanation as to why the film was denied press. Brown and his producers have pondered whether it was because the format was not definable enough, or that the subject-matter was seen as a hot potato as President Donald Trump came back into power with a pledge to crackdown on illegal immigration.

Whatever the reason, Chakra sees the film’s success as a win-win for all involved.

“Downplayed by many, it connected with millions globally,” he posted in the wake of the data. “It’s a win for everyone pushing bold original Arab content, and a reminder that when we back the right stories, with the right intent, they travel.”",NewsAPI,-4.97,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/deadline-bias-and-reliability/,Left,Reliable,41.35,"Deadline, deadline.com",https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/deadline-hollywood/,,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/deadline-media-bias,LEFT-CENTER,HIGH,USA,MOSTLY FREE,Website,High Traffic,HIGH CREDIBILITY,Lean Left,,,,,,Unknown,Lean Left,Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,deadline.com,,deadline,13,USA,,,,
854,8,Court says Trump can’t bar refugees from entering US with travel ban,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/7/15/court-says-trump-cant-bar-refugees-from-entering-us-with-travel-ban,2025-07-15T18:39:05Z,Al Jazeera English,GB,refugee,"The Trump administration has faced a raft of legal challenges as it seeks to radically restrict immigration to the US.

A United States federal judge has ruled that the administration of President Donald Trump cannot block approved refugees from entering the country under the guise of a wider travel ban.

US District Judge Jamal Whitehead ruled late on Monday that Trump’s June order barring people from 12 countries from entering the US expressly states that it will not stop people from seeking refugee status.

“In other words, by its plain terms, the Proclamation excludes refugees from its scope,” Whitehead wrote.

The ruling is the latest development in a dizzying number of court cases challenging the Trump administration’s efforts to radically restrict immigration through a raft of policies that have stretched the limits of executive power.

The judge ordered the administration to continue processing a group of 80 refugees who had already been through vetting and were “presumptively protected refugees” who were nonetheless turned back due to the travel ban.

That ban applies to 12 countries and expands on a similar effort pursued by Trump during his first term in office, when his so-called “Muslim ban” prompted widespread anger and faced legal challenges before being ultimately upheld by the conservative-majority Supreme Court.

The June order applies to countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran, and Sudan, as well as Haiti and Myanmar, among others.

US court delays Trump plan to end TPS protections

The administration has also revoked existing legal status for scores of people from countries like Afghanistan and Haiti, throwing their future in the country into doubt and opening them up to the possibility of deportations to countries that experts say remain mired in conflict and unsafe conditions.

A US court temporarily paused an order by the Trump administration ending Temporary Protective Status (TPS) for Afghans living in the US on Monday, several hours before it was set to expire, extending that status by one week as the court deliberates on the issue further.

Trump suspended the US refugee admissions programme upon entering office at the beginning of his second term in January, leaving thousands of people who had already been cleared for admission, sometimes after years of an arduous bureaucratic and vetting process, in a state of limbo.

A handful of refugees and advocacy groups sued, and Whitehead ruled in February that the administration could not suspend a programme created and funded by Congress. A US Circuit court put that decision on hold in March, however, ruling that the president has wide latitude over the question of who may enter the country.",NewsAPI,-7.26,Ad Fontes Media,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-jazeera-bias-and-reliability/,Skews Left,Reliable,41.29,"al jazeera english, Al Jazeera, AlJazeera.com, Al Jazeera International  ",not found,https://ground.news/interest/al-jazeera_1a2e2c,https://www.allsides.com/news-source/al-jazeera-media-bias,,,,,,,,Lean Left,Al Jazeera Media Network,1996,-2.3,Lean Left,High,Lean Left,Unknown,Lean Left,Lean Left,Lean Left,aljazeera.com,,al jazeera english,65,UK,Y,A,Al Jazeera,
